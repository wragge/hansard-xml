          <para class="block">In submitting this motion to the House I should like to put on record, very briefly some of the work done by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce. He died on the 24th June of this year at the age of 82 years. He was a member of the Commonwealth Grants Commission from January, 1939, to January,  1944,  and he was  chairman  of the Defence Board of Business Administration during the last war. He was, as everybody will know, a senator forWestern Australia from 1901 to 1938 and he held many ministerial portfolios during his long terra in Parliament. He was Acting Prime Minister in  1916  and he was a Commonwealth Minister for  25  years. When defeated in 1937 he was the only remaining original member of the Senate, </para>
          <para class="block">He was Chairman of Committees in  1907- 8,  and Minister for Defence in  1908- 9,  from  1910  to 1913, from  1914  to 1921 and from 1932 to 1934. He visited England in  1919  in connexion with the repatriation of Australian soldiers. He was. a signatory of the Peace Treaty with Austria as a representative of Australia in  1919.  He represented Australia at the Disarmament Conference atWashington in 1921. He was Minister for Home and Territories from 1921 to 1926, Vice-President of the Executive Council from 1926 to 1929, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate in  1930-31,  Minister for External Affairs and Minister in Charge of Territories from October, 1934, to November, 1937, when he resigned from Cabinet following&#39; his defeat at the general election in 1937. He was a delegate to the League of Nations in 1927. He was, itmay rightly be said, one of the authors of the Royal . Australian Navy and of the Royal Australian Air Force. He became a Privy Councillor in 1921. He was awarded the decoration of a Commander of the Legion of Honour in 1924 and became a Knight Commander of the &#34;Victorian Order in 1927. </para>
          <para>The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce is survived by twosons and two daughters to whom the profound sympathy of this House will go out. I do not desire to attempt the task of evaluating the work <inline font-style="italic">lune</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce. I content myself by saying that I think, and we all thought, that he was a very distinguished Australian. If I may make one personal observation, as one who has himself had a good deal of experience of sitting in governments  and of being involved in the work of .governments, it is that I do not think that I ever sat in any cabinet with an  ab!er  man. 1 atn perfectly certain that, as time noes on, the work done by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce.  and the character, quality, and ability he brought to the service of this  country  will bo increasingly recognized. </para>

            <para>. - On behalf of  Her  Majesty&#39;s Opposition I support and second the motion that the Prime Minister has moved. The work of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce over the years really speaks eloquently for itself, but there are two matters concerned with it with which I urn, to some degree, acquainted personally. They are <inline font-weight="bold">Ms work</inline> in connexion with the Commonwealth Grants Commission and his work on the Board of Business Administration of the Department of Defence. I know that the services Hindered by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce during World War II. were regarded . very highly by the&#34; War Cabinet and the Australian War Advisory Council of i hose days, and were also so regarded by the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin.</inline> I have much honour, therefore, in seconding the motion. </para>

            <para>- I desire to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> It wag my privilege to know the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce intimately. .We entered the Parliament together, and for many years were closely associated as fellow members of Parliament and as members&#39; of the same, government. He was one of the best administrators I have known. He was tireless in his efforts to serve his country and to promote the well-being and interests of members of the defence forces and of the people generally. It is inevitable that memories of the past should crowd in upon me on the occasion when we are lamenting the passing of a great parliamentarian. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce may be so called, because ho passed the greater part of his life in parliaments. Nobody is better able than I am to speak of his many great qualities. He had wide vision and ripe judgment. Keenly alive to the vital issues at stake in World War I., he bent all his efforts to perfecting our defence. He had a gift for details, and the defence forces of Australia, which covered themselves with glory, owed much to his sleepless care. He stood in the forefront of the governments of his day.  His  outstanding quality, however, was his gift of administration. It has been my fortune to be associated in governments with men who had great oratorical powers and wide learning, but whose administrative qualities fell short of perfection. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce, as a parliamentarian, administrator, and statesman, earned for himself a high place on the roll of distinguished men who guided and led Australia through its darkest years. During my absence in England, in 1916, he was the Acting Prime Minister. I can say of him that he was a man upon whom one could surely rely. He was my friend, faithful and just to me. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in sending a message of condolence to his relatives. </para>

            <para>- Has the attention of the Minister acting for the Minister for Labour and National Service been directed to the number of persons who are unemployed? Has his attention also been drawn to the fact that a Sydney firm in my electorate recently advertised for two labourers, and that 122 men queued up for the job ? In view of statements attributed to the Government that work, is available, will the Minister inform the House where the vacant jobs exist? If no such jobs exist, will he give immediate consideration to increasing the rate of unemployment benefit? </para>

This camp has been used for a considerable time by the Victorian Department pf  Education  as a camp foi children and teachers and I understand that it has  been  very usefully employed for that purpose. Representations have been made to me about its return to the Army, because its use has so greatly benefited children that if it is at all possible it should be retained for them. Will the Minister indicate whether there is any possibility that it may be so retained ? </para>

            <para>- The camp mentioned by the honorable member is part of the defences of Port Phillip. At the request of the Victorian Department of Education after the end of World War II., it was made available for the purposes mentioned by the honorable gentleman. Because the Australian Army is expanding rapidly, I decided that it is no longer possible for this property to be left to the use of the Victorian Department of Education. Before I came to that decision I personally satisfied myself, after exhaustive inquiry, that we had no alternative but to resume occupation of the property. I discussed the matter with the Premier of Victoria, and after our negotiations the property was promptly returned to the Commonwealth. I express appreciation pf its prompt return to us, and I concluded that this action by th,e Victorian Government indicated that some alternative proposition was available to ;t. If it had been possible for the Australian Government to assist the Victorian Government in this matter, it would have been only too glad to do so. </para>

            <para>- Will the Minister acting for the Minister for Immigration request Commonwealth Hostels Limited to withdraw the excessive and obviously incorrect accounts for electricity that are being sent to British immigrants at Gepps Cross Hostel and replace them by accounts which the Electricity Trust of South Australia considers would be reasonable to cover the period of occupancy of huts by the immigrants concerned? By way of explanation, I point out that the accounts contain obvious errors. In certain instances, apparently the meters have worked backwards. Despite that, immigrants have received accounts for &#163;5 when the charge should have been about 17s. </para>

              <para>- I have been advised that the problem of finding employment for immigrants who were stationed at Bonegilla has been practically met. During the week ended the 27th July,  434 of them had been placed, and during the following week a further 681 had been placed. As at the 2nd of August, there were still 700 immigrants at Bonegilla, and it is expected that these will be placed in employment during the current week, I have no information regarding the retrenchment of immigrants in Tasmania. I understand that those immigrants were brought out at the request of the Hydro-electric Commission and I should assume that that body would have a certain responsibility to maintain .them in employment. As I have said, I have no definite information on that matter; but if such immigrants have been retrenched, I suggest that they should register at the employment office in their locality and every effort will be made to place them in employment. </para>

            <para>- The advantages of the new scheme over the old Chifley hospital benefits scheme are demonstrated by the fact that, under the new scheme, Queensland should receive about 2,500,000 annually, instead of &#163;1,000,000 or &#163;1,100,000, which it has been receiving up to the present time, in contributions to its hospital revenues. The population of Queensland is a little more than 1,200;000. The old scheme provides for a Commonwealth contribution of only about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1 per capita</inline> annually, whereas the new scheme provides for a Commonwealth contribution of about &#163;2 <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> annually. The honorable member has asked whether this Government has attempted to dictate hospital policy in Queensland. The truth is that dictatorial powers were exercised under the terms of the Chifley hospital benefits scheme. That plan provided that benefits should be obtainable by the State governments on behalf of their hospitals only if certain limiting conditions were observed. Those restrictions were removed by this Government in January, 1951. Wo undertaking is required of the Queensland Government in order that it may benefit under the new scheme, except that it shall take steps to increase its hospital revenues to a degree acceptable to the Australian Government. The imposition of a. means test in Queensland was discussed recently at a meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers. The Premier of Queensland admitted then that, in his State, a means test was applied by hospital dental clinics. I discovered, upon investigation, that a similar means test had been in operation for many years at the Canberra Community Hospital. Such a means test seems to me to be very reasonable. </para>

If the Minister made that statement, does it indicate that this Government realizes that it has an obligation to ensure that hospitals throughout Australia shall be able to look forward to a diminution of their huge financial burdens 1 </para>

              <para>- The position is quite different from that stated by the honorable member. I was asked whether the- Commonwealth was willing to do anything about hospital overdrafts. I replied that it would be useless to attempt to do anything about them until a condition of affairs had been established under which a certain guaranteed insurance revenue was available to hospitals to enable them to cover their expenditure such as is possible in the Government&#39;s proposals. I stated that when that had been done, the matter could be considered.  </para>

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Prime Minister, relates to the order of discharge of temporary female employees from the Public Service. There has been a large retrenchment of such employees by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. Will i ho Prime Minister do all that he can do fu ensure that the services of temporary female employees will be retained in the Public Service? Many of these, employees rendered good and faithful service during the war years, and some of them have   leven years service. If retrenchments lie inevitable, will the Prime Minister ensure that the appropriate authorities shall take into account the degrees of hardship that dismissal would inflict upon both married and single female employees? In some instances, such women are the principal breadwinners for their homes. If the Prime Minister has not yet given consideration to this matter, will he do so? </para>

            <para>- I had reached an understanding with the State governments and the Australian Wheat Growers Federation that work upon the details of a stabilization plan should proceed upon the assumption that there would be a new international wheat agreement, but no decision was reached upon that subject by the International Wheat Council. Therefore, I raised the matter with the State governments at a recent meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council. The present proposal is that within the next two or three weeks I shall discuss with the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, on behalf of the State governments and this Government the possibility of extending the existing plan by legislation for one year on terms that would be adopted only if they were acceptable to the Government and the industry. That would give the&#39; Government an opportunity to discover whether there is to be an international wheat agreement next year. If there is to he an agreement, th&#38; Government could proceed to discuss the possibility of a plan to extend over a longer term. I hope and expect to mee representatives of the. Australian Wheal Growers Federation in the next two or three weeks to discuss this matter. </para>

Can the right honorable gentleman inform the House whether any one had authority to promise that Australia would provide 1,000,000 Anzacs to defend Japan and other Pacific countries against Russian aggression?

          <para>Min HASLUCK. - Speaking in round figures and subject to correction, I believe that the export of crude rubber from Papua and New Guinea in 1950-51 was about 2,1&#39;00 tons&#39; and in- 1951-52 about 2,800 tons- The Government and the territorial administration are encouraging expansion of the rubber industry in the territory. The: measures&#39; that are being taken are in two forms: One is to try to acquire land for the growing of rubber in suitable areas and make it available in conformity with established land policy. Other efforts are directed at. trying to produce planting material and! gain more information about the methods of rubber cultivation in other territories. In Both directions, the Government is engaged now in certain activities which have- not yet been completed^ The Director of the Rubber Research Institute of Malaya- is undertaking a tour of Papua arid&#39; New Guinea this month by arrangement with the Australian Government&#39; to investigate problems of rubber-growing and to advise the Government on the best method&#39;s to follow. </para>

            <para>- I address a question to the Minister for Works in relation to the slackening in the building of houses while thousands of families are practically homeless, or are living in motor garages and sheds of various kinds. In many instances, three or four families are living in one house. Is it a fact that this position has been aggravated by the Government&#39;s policy of restricting credit for home building as it has done in respect of other public works? Is the Minister aware that men have been dismissed at hundreds of saw-mills because of the slackening in the demand for timber, that brickyards are full of bricks, that men have been dismissed from brickworks and that carpenters and bricklayers are walking the streets in search of work? </para>

            <para>- I shall leave that part of the honorable member&#39;s question that relates to finance to be dealt with in the budget which will be introduced to-night. In any event, it is not a question that I, as Minister for Works, should be asked to answer. Furthermore, a large part of the honorable member&#39;s question relates to the policies of the State governments. In spite of the noises that honorable member&#39;s opposite are making, my statement is a fact. At the last meeting of the  Australian  Loan Council, this Government made available additional money out of its own resources when adequate, loan moneys were not likely to be available, particularly for housing, and that money is in the hands of the States. Therefore, this Government has done everything possible to maintain the volume of house construction. The only houses that my department builds are for the defence services and for instrumentalities such as the Meteorological Bureau in New  Guinea  and the administration on Lord Howe Island. The solution of the problem that the honorable member has raised is a matter not for either the Commonwealth or the Department of Works but for the States. </para>

            <para>- Is the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture aware that for some considerable time rice has been practically unobtainable in Western Australia? I understand that the shortage will soon become acute throughout Australia. In view of the fact that other primary producers, such as barleygrowers, are restricted in their exports in order to meet home-consumption needs, does any similar restriction apply to ricegrowers? If the production of rice is insufficient to meet Australia&#39;s requirements, is any action being taken to increase production of this commodity which is very necessary from a dietary point of view? </para>

            <para>- All the rice that is produced in Australia is produced in the irrigation areas of New South Wales. Unfortunately the rice crop this year will be very light. Plantings were adequate. However, owing, first, to certain seasonal circumstances and, later, to lack of action to deal with a veritable plague of wild ducks in the areas concerned, the crop will be extraordinarily light. The Rice Marketing Board of New South Wales, which controls rice, has agreed that rice shall be allocated, first, in Australia, to meet the needs of inmates of hospitals, persons who have been ordered rice as a diet, on medical prescription; orientals, particularly in the pearling areas of Western Australia, Darwin and Torres Strait; and, secondly, in New Zealand, to meet the needs of persons in similar categories. In addition to those categories, the needs of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and those of contiguous areas that have always depended upon Australian production for their rice supplies, such as Phosphate Island, New Caledonia and the New Hebrides, will be supplied. Those categories will practically exhaust the whole of our last rice crop. There will be practically nothing left for ordinary civilian use in Australia. A few hundred tons of rice, out of a total crop of 30,000 tons, are being sent to supplement the deficiency of rice in the Malayan area. However, there is an existing arrangement under which, while there is no coupon ration- : the committee in control of rice holds a sufficient quantity to ensure that, until the next crop comes in, it will be  possible  to supply rice necessary for people who require it on medical advice. </para>

              <para>- The Commonwealth has no direct production responsibilities in agriculture except in its own territories. The Minister for Territories is actively engaged at the present time in making plans with the ultimate view, he hopes, to the production of rice in the territories. However, the Commonwealth has no responsibility or authority for rice growing in the States. The Rice Marketing Board of New South Wales is certainly not under the control of the Commonwealth. Indeed, the status of the Commonwealth in the whole matter only stems from its responsibility in respect of exports and , the policies that are associated with decisions in connexion with them. </para>

              <para>- I wish to make -a personal explanation. The incident to which the honorable member for Parkes fc*s referred appears to have assumed proportions that are not justified by the facts which a-re that another honorable member <inline font-style="italic">mid</inline> myself were in the Northern Territory .and were studying, among other things, the uranium, resources there. As you know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I have pointed out in this House and elsewhere &#39;that it is eminently desirable that Geiger counters should be used, and that our uranium resources -should be known. When we reached Rum Jungle, and reported  to the head-quarters -there, we were asked whether we had any cameras or Geiger counters, since these were not permitted in the mine. We said that we had, -and were asked to leave them at the head-quarters until we returned from the mine. That is all there was in the incident. It is entirely undesirable that people should try to make political capital out of the fact that we were carrying Geiger counters because, in the interests of the security of this .country, it is eminently desirable that prospecting for  uranium  should proceed. Anything which is intended to prevent people from using Geiger counters, and to hold their use np to derision, is directly contrary to the interests of the nation. </para>

            <para>- It is true that helicopters have proved of great use in Korean waters but I point out that they have a very limited use. The honorable member's attention should also be drawn to the fact that we have a limited amount of finance available for expenditure on the Air Force, and we have matters of far greater importance than the one he has mentioned on which we can expend our funds. We do not intend at present, or for some years to come, to increase the number of  heliocopters  in the Air Force. </para>

            <para>- I direct to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture a question that arises from the fact that the Government has decided to make available to the States a sum of &#163;200,000 for the purpose of providing a better advisory service to farmers. Soil conservation&#39; services in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania are within the respective Departments of Agriculture of those States, and will therefore automatically share in any distribution of the fund. In New South Wales, however, the Soil Conservation1 Service and in Victoria, the Soil Conservation Authority, are independent of the Departments&#39; of Agriculture in those States and so, unless they are specially catered for, may not receive any money from the fund. Will the Minister, therefore, take action to ensure that some part of the allocation from Victoria and New South&#39; Wales shall be made specifically to be applied to the assistance of the soil conservation bodies in New South Wales and Victoria? </para>

            <para>- The provision of this year&#39;s payment of &#163;200,000 for the purpose of widening the extension services to farmers is an indication of the interest of the Government in ensuring that the farming community is kept constantly, and to the greatest possible degree, abreast of the scientific resources, and technological resources in connexion with their industry. It is hoped, and, indeed:, expected that an arrangement: will be worked out this year in. accordance with which the States will make an additional contribution&#39;. I hope that the industries concerned will also make a direct contribution. However, this matter will not be handled exclusively by the various departs ments of agriculture, and it will certainly not represent any duplication by the Commonwealth of the kind of activities that are now the responsibilities and practices of the States. At the present time my officers are engaged in working out the best means for the use of the funds allocated for the current year, and the best kind of arrangement of a continuing character. I assure the honorable member that everything that he has in mind will be considered in the plans that are in hand. </para>

            <para>- My question- to the. Minister for the Army- is prompted1 by a letter which I wrote to him. on the 14th July last and to which I have not yet received a reply. The correspondence related to a youth in South Australia who was. due to be called&#39; up for national service training. He invoked, section 29 of the National Service Act which applies to conscientious objectors. Evidently, he was not able to prove his case, and1 he was sent to the Holdsworthy Camp in New South Wales for detention. I ask th&#39;e Minister whether it is possible for a person who unsuccessfully invokes section 29 of the act to be detained in the State in which he resides. I tried to. discover last,, weekend whether the boy had been! returned, to South Australia, but I was not  able  to obtain the information. Great resentment is&#39; felt in South Australia about this matter, because the boy concerned is the sole support of his- mother. . Will the Minister investigate the practice adopted in the United States of America- whereby provision is made for a youth, who claims fo be a conscientious objector when he is called up for universal military service, to do some work of a national or  charitable  kind? </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - Provision is made in the National Service Act for persons who have conscientious objections to military service to claim exemption from their liability to render such service, and for the case to be tried before an impartial court. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mason</inline> claimed such exemp-  tion, but a civil court in Adelaide, after due consideration of the case, decided that he was required to render service of a non-combatant nature. Subsequently, he was ordered to report for service with other civilians who had been called up for training at the same time, but he failed to comply with that order and, therefore, with the law of the land. Later, he was prosecuted by the Department of Labour and National Service, which is responsible for calling up citizens to undergo military training. The court committed him to Army custody for the purpose of rendering the service prescribed by the National Service Act. In accordance with section 51 of that act, he was deemed to have been enlisted for service in the Commonwealth Military Forces when he was taken into Army custody after the court had announced its decision. </para>

          <para>Private Mason was taken by the Army authorities to the 16th National Service Training Battalion at Woodside, .where, after a short period during which hp agreed to help in kitchen fatigues, he refused to carry out any duties. H*&#62; would not agree to wear uniform at any stage. He was interviewed by an Army chaplain, by the pastor of his own religious sect and by officers of his unit, but he persisted in his refusal to render service of any nature or to wear uniform. He refused even to assist the padre to distribute hymn books in the Army chapel. Accordingly, the prescribed Army authority ordered that Private Mason be detained in the military corrective establishment at Holdsworthy, New South Wales, which is a prescribed place under the National Service Act, to complete his lawful obligation of 176 days service. Before that order was issued, Private Mason&#39;s mother and the pastor of his religious sect were told of the intended action by Major-General Kendall, the General Officer Commanding, Central Command. The Army authorities, when they took action to order Private Mason to be detained, had no alternative but to carry out the order of the court. That step was taken only as a last resort and was forced upon them bv the refusal of the lad to co-operate with them in any way. I have been informed that other conscientious  objectors  who belong to the same  religious  sect have been called up and are giving all reasonable co-operation in performing duties of a non-combatant nature. My department does not desire that this youth shall perform duties other than those of a non-combatant nature, but it has no option but to give effect to the court&#39;s decision. </para>
          <para>When Private Mason was transferred to the military corrective establishment at Holdsworthy, he was informed that if at any time he indicated his willingness to undergo normal training of a non-combatant nature, instructions would be issued for his release from the corrective establishment and for his transfer to the 16th National Service Training Battalion at Woodside to complete his period of training. At my direction, instructions have been issued that no undue coercion shall be brought to bear upon him while he is detained in Holdsworthy t&#39;o compel him to wear uniform, to train or to work. The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> and myself have received numerous representations for the National Service Act to be amended  to give conscientious objectors a right of appeal against the decisions of magistrates. The Government i? now considering those representations. </para>

Nevertheless, I believe that Mason has not been treated in a manner that meets with the approval of freedom-loving Australians. He is the only son of a widow, and is almost her sole means of support. No one doubts that his objections&#39; to military service are sincere. Provision is made in the National Service Act for persons who have a conscientious objection to military training to be exempted from undergoing such training. The Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> has stated that he has been informed that other conscientious objectors who are members of the religious sect to which Mason belongs have been called up for service and are co-operating with the Army authorities in performing duties of a non-combatant nature. I believe that the Minister has been wrongly informed. I have received a letter from the pastor of that sect, in which he has asked me to protest to the Government about the manner in which Mason has been treated. Therefore, I find it difficult to believe that other members of the pastor&#39;s congregation have agreed to perform military service. </para>

              <para>- He would  not  distribute hymn books in a military camp at Woodside, but no one has suggested that he would not distribute them in his own church. Although provision is made in the legislation for&#39; conscientious, objectors to seek exemption from military service, no provision is made for appeals from the decisions of magistrates who refuse to grant such exemptions. The right of appeal is given to conscientious objectors in time of war and the same right should be given to them in peacetime. The American provision for an appeal by conscientious objectors might well be adapted to national service training in Australia. </para>

            <para>- by <inline font-style="italic">leaveit</inline> is very distasteful for any authority that is supported by a government to have to order any man to be incarcerated  as  happened in the case of the young man to whom the honorable member  for  Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chambers)</inline> has referred, but any system of compulsory military training must provide for action  of a  penal or a compelling nature.  The  history of the case to which the honorable member for Adelaide has referred shows clearly that, at every step,  the  youth was given an opportunity to accept a reasonable compromise with his religious beliefs, even after a magistrate had ruled that he could not be classed as  a  conscientious objector within the meaning of the law. &#39; At that stage, the youth was offered honorable and reasonable ways  of  performing his national service which would  not  conflict with his religious convictions. I heard with mixed feelings that the Government proposes  to  introduce amending legislation  in  relation  to such -cases.  &#34;I  &#34;have &#39;always regarded conscientious objection to military service  as  &#62;a (luxury &#60;and  I -am  doubtf ul whether any  country  &#39;can  afford <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> *except ;on -the  most limited scale.  .Quakers ase not willing *to serve in  fighting  units, but they are &#34;always amongst the first to volunteer to &#60;bear stretchers or &#39;perform duties of that nature.

              <inline font-style="italic">.- ~by leave</inline>- :I wash, to &#39;inform the House of two decisions .affecting .the administration of native welfare  policy  in the Northern Territory. The effect of the first will be to allow &#34;those persons of aboriginal and part-aboriginal origin who do not need the protection of special legislation, to enjoy the customary rights of citizenship without  having  to -apply for exemption from &#34;the &#39;special legislation. &#39;The effect of the second win he that, if any part of a native -reserve has ceased to be necessary -for the use and benefit -of the natives, it -may be severed from the -reserve and, -if mining should ta&#39;ke place on the severed -portion, royalties will be paid into  a  special fund to <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> applied to the welfare of the natives.  (On the  18th  October last  I  presented to -the House a -report on the (native welfare conference held -ait Canberra on the ;3rd and 4th &#39;September, 3 951. Fallowing that .conference,  I  asked the Administrator -of the .Northern Territory, the Honorable F,. J.. S. Wise, to examine the conclusions reached by the  conference  and to advise one .on the best means of implementing, -in the Northern Territory, the -  policy  &#39;that had been  declared.  During December &#39;and April last  -an  inter-departmental committee, under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise,</inline> mot in Darwin,, .examined the practical problems in great detail &#62;and prepared an .extremely valuable departmental paper that .contained :a  wide range of submissions on the various steps which might be taken either .immediately  or  in .the course  of  the years in or  Her  to give effect .to the. declared policy.  .Some  of their recommendations are already being put into administrative effect; provision .for carrying out some others is being made this year; and others  are  being further examined. Foremost among the  submissions  was  va  series of  recommendations to give -effect to this Government&#39;s policy in respect of &#39;citizenship for the native people. These have been extended in further discussions between the Administrator and myself in order to give -complete -effect to  the  policy on this, subject that  I had  -previously  announced  &#62;to this House. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>At present there  are  many natives,  ,a few full-blood  as well as mixed-blood, who are prepared for -and capable -of accepting the full responsibilities of citizenship. &#39;.There  tare  also many .others who will  require  for many years to come t3ie benefits and protection of special legislation, and who must he regarded .as  wards  .of .the State standing in .need -of ^guardianship and tutelage.  I  should like to make it clear - <inline font-style="italic">&#39;-to</inline> correct a popular misconception - that in the &#39;Northern Territory to-day the -path <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> &#39;full &#39;citizenship is -already open and. in fact, &#62;a con.siderable  number  -of .natives, nearly all  of them persons of mixed blood, Lave attained the enjoyment of those rights. 1. he present path towards citizenship for such persons is, however, hedged by conditions which some coloured Australian citizens find irksome and even offensive and which, in application, sometimes give rise to needless difficulties and anomalies. </para>
          <para>The present system is based on an attempt to define the term &#34; aboriginal &#34;,  all  special legislation being made to apply to those persons who come within the definition unless, by application to an official, they can obtain exemption from the special legislation. It is now proposed to abandon this old method and to assume that, unless a person is brought under the special legislation, it does not apply to him or her. The ground on which a person will be brought under the legislation will not be colour, or a fraction of colour, or any other racial or genealogical, reason, but the test whether he or she stands in need of special care or assistance. Provision will also be .made so that a person who objects to being brought under the special legislation or a person who considers that he has outgrown the need for special care and assistance can apply to a magistrate sitting in chambers and have the opportunity .of proving to an independent authority that by his mode of living and his capacity to manage his own affair1he can assume his place as a member of the general community. The new system will bc closely analogous to that customarily followed with regard to those of European race who need- special care - for example, neglected children who are committed to the child welfare departments of the State governments. In order that the nature of the change may he made clear, I am proposing to establish, in place of the Native Affairs Branch of the Territorial. Administration, a welfare branch, under a director of welfare, whose activities will embrace all sections of the community in the Northern Territory requiring special care and assistance. The Director of Welfare will have a responsibility and authority in respect of the natives under his care similar to those of the present Director of Native Affairs, and will also be required specifically to promote the development of the native people. He will be responsible for all welfare services for the territory community not already covered by other federal departments. </para>
          <para>To give effect to the change, new legislation will have to be passed by the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory to replace the existing native ordinances. This legislation is now being prepared, and <inline font-style="italic">our</inline> aim is to have it ready for introduction in the council at the end of this year. Although some details require closer examination, the intended effect will be that, after its passage, the Administrator, on the recommendation of the Director of Welfare, will formally declare that specified persons or groups of persons stand in need of special care and assistance. It is anticipated that those originally named will be the natives who are in fact, under the State&#39;s protection at the present time, foi example, on reserves or settlements, or in employment under permit. Those who are exempted from the present ordinance, and those who, even if not formally exempted, have customarily lived in the manner of the European community, will be left outside the ordinance. It will be made possible from time to time to bring other persons under the special legislation, subject to appeal to a magistrate, if it is shown that they need guardianship, and it will be made possible for the courts to commit a person to the care of the Director of Welfare. These decision.will depend wholly on the conduct and mode of living of the persons concerned, and not on their colour. Thus it is believed that, in the course of a very short period, the native people will help to sort themselves out into those who need care and assistance and those who can stand on their own feet. From time to time, with the social advancement of natives, the Administrator will be able to declare that a person or group of persons has ceased to need -special care and assistance and, without application on their part, free them from the special legislation.&#39; Unless a person is brought under the special legislation he or she will take a place in the ordinary life of the community as a citizen. </para>

          <para>Already there are a number of coloured citizens of the Northern Territory who  si  re taking a part in the life of the general  community,  aud it is hoped that more will be encouraged to do so by the knowledge that henceforth they have citizenship as n birthright into which each man and woman can enter when he or she is able to take up the duties of citizenship. As a further indication of the Government&#39;s view a direction has been given that, in appointing statutory bodies such as school committees, State children&#39;s councils and similar authorities in the territory, consideration be given as a matter of practice to the appointment to them  lit&#39;  people of aboriginal descent. </para>
          <para>My second announcement relates to aboriginal reserves. Reservations of land &#34; for the use and benefit of the aboriginal native inhabitants &#34; have been proclaimed from time to time in the Northern Territory, and the area of such reserves now totals about 64,000 square miles. The law allows the resumption of this land, either wholly or in part, the Minister being required to lay before both Houses of the Parliament a statement setting forth the reasons for resumption. The creation of the greater part of these reserves dates back to twenty years ago or earlier, when policy in regard to the advancement of the natives was less hopeful than it is to-day and when governmental and church activity designed to change the life of the natives was less extensive than it is to-day. To-day there are fewer than 6,000 natives on the reserves, and of these it is estimated that only 600 are living a fully tribalized life. Over 4,000 of the natives on reserves are considered to be wholly under mission influence or Government influence, and over 1.000 are partly under such influence. In the  large  Arnhem Land reserves, there are eight Christian mission stations,  largely  supported by Government funds a.i the accepted agents in the advancement of native welfare, and there is an increasing tendency for the native tribesmen to bo drawn more and more closely into touch with the missions. There has also been a tendency for some time past for natives to be attracted away from the reserves towards centres of settlement. J mention these facts to honorable members, not to suggest that reserves are no longer needed, but to indicate the tendency towards change in the use of reserves and to suggest that, as this breaking down of primitive native life continues over the years, we - both the Government and the missions - are tending to reduce the need either for extensive hunting grounds or for tribal ceremonial sites. A policy of assimilation and the measures taken for the education and care of natives mean that less dependence is placed on reserves as an instrument of policy than was placed on them in the days when it was considered that the interests of the natives could only be served by keeping them away from white settlement. Nevertheless, the change to which I have referred is taking place slowly and, for many generations to come, large reservations will still be necessary and any reduction of the area of reserves will have to be accompanied by other measures to ensure native welfare. </para>
          <para>On the other side of the picture, we sec the necessity for developing OU national resources. At the present time, the strongest pressure comes from the need that is seen to extract the latent mineral wealth of the territory. For many years past, those who have closely followed the subject of native welfare have foreseen the clash of interest that will come when the large reservations, which were created liberally but rather carelessly in the past, are found to contain or are suspected of containing rich mineral deposits. That clash of interest is taking place to-day. </para>
          <para>The Government has considered the matter Very carefully. It recognizes the force of the argument that reserved land which is not in fact being used by the natives should not be closed forever to exploration or development. It also recognizes that to-day the large reserve is a less essential means of protecting the  welfare  of  the natives than it was a generation  ago.  At the same time, the Government is convinced that the excision of land from reserves, or any exploration  of  reserves, must he handled with great care and gradualness in order to safeguard the interests of the natives, and that some form of compensatory benefit should be given. As there is in no sense anything in the form of  a  personal title  to  the lands which the Crown reserved, that compensatory benefit will have to be accorded to the natives as  a  whole and  not to any  single person or family. </para>
          <para>After an  examination of various possibilities, the Government has authorized the Administrator to introduce into the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory an ordinance governing the matter. It is intended to give the Administrator power to grant prospecting and mining rights on aboriginal reserves, subject to such conditions as he may consider necessary to protect the interests of the natives, with complementary rights to enter on and remain on reserves for the purposes of such prospecting and mining. The Administrator will also be given power to recommend the resumption  or  revocation of land from an aboriginal reserve for mining purposes, such recommendation to be accompanied  by  a statement regarding the effect of such resumption or revocation on the welfare of the natives on the reserve. Such revocations or resumptions must be notified to this Parliament with a statement setting forth the reasons, and it will, of course, be within the competence of this Parliament to disallow any action of which it disapproves. Royalties will be levied on any minerals won from mining on aboriginal reserves or from lands resumed therefrom for mining purposes, and these royalties will be paid into a trust fund to be applied, with the approval of the Minister, for the general benefit of aborigines as the Minister determines, including the making of grants to aboriginal institutions. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, I emphasize that this is a decision to give the legal power and to lay down the legal procedure for handling this question if and when the need to  do  so arises.  It  is not a decision in  any particular case, nor will the passing of  the proposed ordinance by the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory of itself mean the diminution of any reserve. Any action will be subsequent, to the passage of the ordinance and will be consequential on any application which may happen to be made to the Administrator. For general information, I may add that the instruction which I have given on this matter to my department and to the Administrator for their guidance is to the effect that they are not to take action to encourage people to prospect or mine on aboriginal reservations, nor should they allow the public to get the idea that we intend to throw open reserves for a search for minerals. If a situation arises in which it becomes necessary in the national interest to allow prospecting or mining we shall have the means to do so, but in any such case the effect on the interests of the natives will have to be weighed before consideration is given to any other aspect. If mining is allowed, the natives and the institutions caring for them will benefit through the levying of royalties. I lay on the table the following paper: - </para>

            <para>.-This important bill deals with the whole law of patents. After careful consideration, the Opposition is iti agreement with the  measure.  On some details honorable members on this side of the House might  desire  to offer suggestions or criticisms/ but -I wish to refer to certain matters of general principles. I believe  that  the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> and the committee which was  responsible for bringing down the bill have done a public service, for there is nothing more complicated or technical than the law which gives to inventors a monopoly in respect of their inventions. It seems a simple principle, but in practice it is &#39; a branch of the law which teems with  technicalities,  involving appeal after appeal from court to &#39;court, and it must really be a considerable factor in the coilduct of certain businesses that are dependent to any degree at all upon the exploitation of letters patent. I have already referred one particular matter to the Minister in charge of the bill. It appears that prior to the passage of the amending legislation of 1946, complete specifications of inventions described in the ordinary form of application did not become open to public inspection until they were accepted -; and the period averaged, perhaps, two and a half years after the time of lodgment. But in  the case  of what are called convention applications, that is applications the source df which is a foreign country withwhich Australia has an agreement, complete specifications were lodged with the application, and in the Vast majority of instances they became open to inspection more speedily, practically immediately. All the more important inventions affecting the development of Australian indus.try that come from, abroad are enclosed in specifications of what are called convention, of foreign, applications. In 1946, the Chifley Government introduced an amending measure that inserted in the law a newprovision for the publication of all complete specifications forthwith after lodgment. That matter was debated, and the Minister in charge of that measure pointed&#39; out that one of the purposes of the law was to encourage the development of Aus; tralian industries by informing them as quickly as possible about impending patents or changes of technical methods. On that occasion, that Minister said - </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">It was decided at that time to delay the publication of all complete specifications for at least two months after they were lodged, and the Prime Minister (Mr; Menzies), who was then Leader of the Opposition, asked that that period be extended to three months. But this measure proposes to delay the publication of all complete specifications, including the very important and preponderating convention specifications, for a period of six months, whereas the vast majority of these, even under the old law, automatically became open to public inspection on the day following that on which they were lodged, or shortly thereafter. The fact is that the committee which has looked into the matter and recommended the provision that makes that change has not given any specific reasons for the further extension, of the secrecy period from two months to six months. Certain manufacturing interests made representation to the Opposition- and I have no  doubt  to the Government also1- about this matte*. I have discussed it with the Minister in charge &#39;of the bill and also <inline font-style="italic">wilh</inline> the  Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline> Spicer)  awd they  have said- -I think fairly  - that they will pay the closest attention to the working of the legislation and will view this particular provision in the light of that experience. </para>

The law says that the inventor must disclose his invention so that after that period use of it will be open to all the world ; . that he must fully disclose it; that the invention must bo worked and that, in certain instances in which it is not sufficiently worked, it is possible for a competitor, or some one else in the industry. </para>

              <para>- That is correct in connexion with inventions that are related to defence. However, I believe that in the interests of technical processes and the encouragement of manufacture a similar principle will sooner or later have to be applied to the whole field of inventions, that is, that if an inventor makes a step forward in a technique, or manufacturing -process, and reveals it, it should be possible for any person to use those ideas subject to the duty to pay compensation to the inventor, such compensation to be assessed by an appropriate tribunal. Foi the inventor of modern times, when the whole process of manufacture is going through such revolutionary changes, the reward should be not monopoly use of the particular invention but a reward that should be assessed by the court to be paid by those persons who shall be free to use the invention right from the commencement. Some of the greatest difficulties in relation to restriction of trade have arisen because of the particular method of rewarding inventors in this field. The principle dates back to the statute of the first Elizabeth when there was little competition and no interlocking of inventions. Under such conditions, it was quite easy <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> delimit the area of monopoly because the field was very limited. But, to-day, the field is so complicated that I believe that, as is done in respect of inventions relating to defence which, in substance, is the law of the British Commonwealth and other countries, it should be open, with proper safeguards provided, for any person to use an invention subject to the user paying compensation, or rewards, to be fixed on just terms by a tribunal, to the person responsible for the discovery. I admit that such action could not be taken by this nation acting alone but, probably, would have to be taken in the international field. That fact emphasizes the difficulty that arises. In the international field, combinations of manufacturing industries in many instances have decided to prevent the use of a new invention because the actual manufacturing equipment in use would become obsolete as a result of some great discovery. That tends to increase the -cost of manufacture and to  hold  back  from  the people  the benefits , of inventions. One could cite many instances of that kind. I believe that, in the long run, the nations that are predominant in this field would find it better for the whole community if a system of that kind were adopted, but in present circumstances that is something which will have to be carefully worked out. This bill is an important step forward in stating and declaring the law in consonance, in substance, with the law of England, and the Opposition supports it. At the same time, we rely upon the Minister&#39;s assurance that in the working of the measure, attention will be given to the experience gained thereby. </para>

            <para>.- In these days when there is a loud call for production and an equally vociferous call for reducing the hours of work, industry relies to a very great degree upon inventions to come to its aid. The purpose of patent legislation is to stimulate inventions. The field, of course, is somewhat limited; that is, limited to manufacture, industry and commerce. The professional man does not seek the aid of patent legislation. If, for instance, a doctor invents a new technique, or produces a new drug, lie makes that knowledge available for the benefit of the whole of mankind; I) ut in the field of industry and commerce it is necessary to give to men incentives to invent. Consequently, patent legislation has been brought into existence, in order, on the one hand, to prevent complete monopoly, and, on the other hand, to give to an inventor a just reward for the work that he has done. Legislation of this nature prevents monopolies because it gives to an inventor the right to be protected for a limited term only, which, under our legislation, is normally a period of sixteen years. It does not in any way tend to make prices rise or to hinder trade. It requires that an invention must possess at least two qualities before it will be recognized, and those qualities are utility and novelty. The invention may be in the form of a new contrivance, a new combination or a new method. All those things will be recognized and will be patentable. </para>

          <para>This bill is founded on the constitutional power of the Parliament to pass laws with regard to patents. It  was  in 1903 that this Parliament first passed a law with regard to patents. That law was based on the English Patents Act. of 1883. No major alteration of our patent law has occurred between 1903 and now, although from time to time certain minor amendments to it have been made. The act came into force in 1904. Whilst there has been a considerable amendment of English patent legislation our patent law, which was originally on the same lines as the English law, has lagged behind English patent law in the last 50 years. This bill is, in part, a repeal bill and, in part, a reenacting and amending bill. In other words, we are retaining our old legislation and, at the same time, bringing it up to date in conformity with English and international ideas of patent law. The bill is the fruit of the work of a committee that was appointed by the Attorney-General. It was a highly skilled and highly specialized committee, and was well qualified to do the work it wa? called on to do. Its membership consisted of a Supreme Court judge who is known as a specialist in patent law. the Commissioner of Patents, two former past presidents of the Institute of Patent Attorneys, and the Parliamentary Draftsman. They undoubtedly gave a great deal of attention to the work, and had before them the reports of a number of previous committees in this country. Included, among those reports was one made by a committee that had the assistance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonney,</inline> K.C., of the New South Wales bar, who was an expert on patent law and who afterwards became a. judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, although, strangely enough, in the divorce jurisdiction. With that material before them, and also with the material provided by committees in England, the committee has been able to produce&#39; a bill which is undoubtedly in every way up to date and should prove useful. </para>
          <para>As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has pointed out, patent law is extremely technical. It deals with rights of a very great value which are a matter of great interest and importance to the industries of this country. The whole basis of the legislation is to produce an  clement of justice as between, on the one baud, the community which should have The right to use inventions and, on the other hand, the inventor who should have a just reward for producing his invention. The fact that the communal interest is greatly concerned in the matter is shown also in other ways in the bill. For example, one of the new provisions is that the Attorney-General shall have the right to oppose the grant of a patent should he consider that, in the public interest, no patent should be granted. </para>
          <para>In bringing the legislation up to date with the English legislation the committee had in mind that both time and money will be saved by so doing, and also that annoyance and inconvenience will be prevented. In the main, the committee has adopted the principles that are set out in the latest English legislation. It has also adopted provisions that have previously not been adopted Imre. but that have been accepted by the International Convention of Patents. The bill is in no way radical. It shows that the committee considered that the existing patent system in this country lias operated well on the whole, but that in certain matters, which are mainly procedural, it should be brought up to date. Tt can be said justly that we shall now have an up-to-date system of patent law operating in this country. Not only should the committee be congratulated on its work, but the Government which, in the words of the Leader of the Opposition, is performing a public service by introducing this legislation, should undoubtedly also be commended. </para>

            <para>.- This is one of those happy but all too infrequent occasions on which both sides of the House are in agreement. This is not a controversial measure. I was pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> =ay that the Opposition fully supports it. The bill is comprehensive and, as will be seen from the summary at the end of its 55 pages, it involves the repeal of the whole of seven earlier acts and of parts of three earlier acts, lt is a grand piece of work and I congratulate the Government for having taken&#39; these steps to bring our patent law up . to date in the light of modern requirements and conditions. I also pay tribute to the expert committee for the grand work that it did in making such a thorough and comprehensive investigation and report, on which the Government has acted so quickly. The fact that practically the whole of our existing patents legislation is to be repealed by this measure should not mislead anybody into believing that there is to be a faundamental  change in the Australian patent law. Ear from it! Careful perusal of the bill will show that only in relation to matters of procedure is there to be any alteration. I believe it to be far better to introduce a new bill and thereby repeal the old acts than to introduce a host of amendments that would serve only to confuse the issue and make an already difficult law even harder to unravel. The bill, as the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Joske)</inline> has pointed out, merely seeks to bring the patent law of Australia up to date and put it in line with the English law, which was amended and brought up to date only three years ago. There has been greater advancement in scientific and technical fields in the half century that has elapsed since the original patent legislation became law in Australia than in any other half century in history. During that time many new industries have come into being, and other new industries are still springing up. This is a young and growing country which faces great expansion in the future. After all, we have barely crossed the threshhold of our history as a nation. I suggest that, in the interests of progress and development, every encouragement and protection should be extended to inventors. All too few of us are of an inventive turn of mind. The importance of inventions, from many points of view, cannot be overstated. History shows the great advantages that have flowed from the adoption of inventions in many fields. &#34;We should avoid the folly that was demonstrated in the seventeenth century, and the early part of the eighteenth century, when recognition of talent in the inventive field was delayed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Now I shall submit a proposition to the Government. Tt is well known that in time of war awards are offered for inventions that will aid in the prosecution of the war effort. I believe that our minds should be .turned in a similar direction in time of peace. I see no reason why attractive monetary incentives should not be offered with a view to encouraging inventions that will help to meet our peace-time requirements. This country&#39;s greatest need is increased productivity. &#91; believe there would be much virtue in providing suitable incentives for the encouragement and formulation of new and better methods and the creation of new designs and new instruments and of new and improved industrial plant and machinery. Over the years Australians have shown themselves to be capable of great  resourcefulness.  They have initiative and a spirit of enterprise. I believe that in. this country we have a pool of inventive talent that could be greatly stimulated by some form of monetary incentive such as I suggest. The records show that the registration of patents in Australia averages 4,000 a year. If some new incentive were provided that number might be greatly increased. Awards could be made to both firms and individuals for the invention of new production methods that would help Australia either to increase its industrial output, earn more dollars, or overcome shortages of particular commodities. The world shortage of tinplate provides an example. It is possible that if sufficient incentive were provided some one would discover, a new formula for the canning of our fruits and other products that would . not necessitate the use of tinplate. I read in the press a few weeks  ago  that an English company had thoughts in that direction, but there has been no such development in Australia. </para>
          <para>The idea of monetary incentive for inventions in peace-time is not new, although it may be new in this country, ft. is certainly not new in Britain, because any &#39; student of history knows that in the eighteenth century, in the time of Nelson, and even before that time, the British Government did a great deal to stimulate the British nautical instruments industry, which played an important part in Britain&#39;s naval development. That encouragement generally consisted of awarding prize money for useful inventions. I suggest that trade associations, chambers of manufactures, chambers of commerce and individual firms should be encouraged to make some contribution towards worthwhile rewards for useful inventions. We all know the  famous  saying &#34; necessity is the mother of invention &#34;. The truth of that saying has been proved in war-time, and it could also be proved in peace-time. A monetary incentive would help greatly to stimulate inventive genius in our  midst  that might otherwise remain latent. </para>
          <para>The bill has some outstanding features that deserve special commendation and which have not been mentioned so far. Clause f&#62;6, which makes provision for the disclosure by the Patent Office of particulars of prior specifications disclosed l-.y official searches is to be commended. The purpose of that provision is to enable full use to be made of the store of technical knowledge residing in the Patent Office which, up to the present time, has not been used to the best possible advantage. Other clauses, such a.clause 95 and clause 120,  will  help t&#60;&#62; facilitate the adoption of inventions by industry and to minimize the delay in putting worthwhile invention&#39;s into practical use. The measure  will give encouragement and protection to inventors and will also ensure that the public interest shall be adequately protected. It will also streamline the procedure in regard to claims and specifications and appeals, and will clarify the position of patent attorneys and of the legal profession in relation to registrations and appeals. In short, the bill abolishes existing anomalies, delays, and difficulties in regard to patents, and modernizes in one grand sweep the whole of our patent law. Therefore, it deserves the wholehearted support of this House. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - In these days of hard-fought party politics, it is gratifying to note that the House is willing and able to approach a bill of this kind in a detached and helpful manner. The Government is deeply obliged to honorable members on both sides of the chamber for their contributions to the debate, and I repeat my earlier assurance that it is not thought that the door is finally closed on patent matters. The operation of this bill will be closely observed, and if it be found that improvements can be made, the Government will give careful consideration to amendments. The honorable member for Ryan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drury)</inline> made a valuable suggestion that will not be overlooked. It is true that in what may be regarded as times of emergency, governments have offered special kinds of incentive to inventors; and there is certainly something to be said for a procedure to stimulate, in peace-time, the inventive genius of our people. Such a provision is not contained in this bill, and it is not exactly proper that it should be, but the suggestion will not be overlooked. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> made a comment on the need, at some time, for a new approach to the whole matter of patent law. I do not close my mind to such a need. Times change and methods should change with them. It may well be that the methods which were suitable in the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries require modification in the middle of the twentieth century. However, as the Leader of the Opposition has acknowledged, that is not properly the subject of a bill of this kind. The right honorable gentleman also indicated that no radical change can be made except by international arrangement, because Australia is a party to the International Copyright Convention. A part of the virtue of the copyright convention, and of patent legislation, is their international character, whereby an inventor, a citizen of one countryis enabled to protect his rights in another country. </para>
          <para>The bill has been carefully drafted by a most distinguished committee. The  chairman,  the Honorable Arthur Dean, is a judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria. The members were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> B. Davies, a practising patent attorney and a past  president  of the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> K. White, a past  president  of the same body; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> R. Wilmot, the Commissioner of Patents; and last but not least, the Parliamentary Draftsman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Q. Ewens, who., as everybody knows, played an important part and made a most valuable contribution to the discussions. I ask the House to note that, although the report of the committee was completed only on the 17th April last, the bill was introduced in the Senate only a few weeks later. In other words, because of the expeditious work of the draftsman, the Government was able to bring this valuable legislation promptly before the Parliament. The Government is grateful to all members of the committee for their valuable contributions to the report. </para>

            <para>. - Many weeks have elapsed since the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> announced to the House the Government&#39;s decision to despatch a Royal Australian Air Force jet fighter wing to the Middle East. I regard the stationing of such a unit in that part of the world as an event of great importance. The object is to place the Royal Australian Air Force wing at a Royal Air Force base for training and experience in an area that presents distinctive problems to our forces. The experience gained by the Royal Australian Air Force when fighting in conjunction with the Royal Air Force in time of war was invaluable. In peace time general training, and particularly co-operative training with the Royal Air Force, is probably the most satisfactory way of developing the Royal Australian Air Force. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Perhaps the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McBride)</inline> or the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon)</inline> will be able to say whether a  suggestion that I intend to make is practicable. For the proper organization of the air defence of the British Commonwealth it is most important that the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Air Force should associate in combined training. From that point of view nothing but good can come of this association of one of our air squadrons with the Royal Air Force. I suggest that some combined training of a similar nature might be arranged within Australia. 1 know that there would be difficulties involved in such an arrangement, but perhaps something along those lines could, be attempted by the Australian Government in conjunction with the British Government, or the Governments of other countries with which &#39; Australia is associated. That training could take place in the northern part of Australia, and in the event of the occurrence of future trouble it would prove to be of enormous value. There are adequate air fields at Townsville and Mareeba because the run-ways that were built there during the last war are still available. If such an arrangement could be made it would not only confirm the policy involved in the joint training plan for air-force specialists, but ais J have a valuable effect on the Australian people by bringing closely to their attention the valuable co-operative work that is being done by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force. </para>

            <para>.- In common with all honorable members on this side of the House I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has supported this move on the part of the Australian Government. Everybody realizes that the Middle East has become, perhaps more than ever before, one of the primary concerns of Australia. Through this  region passes one of our great trade arteries with the northern  hemisphere,  and the greater part of our oil supplies are drawn from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran. It is unnecessary to remind honorable members that in the Middle East our troops fought with  great  distinction in the last two world .wa&#39;i$. The sending of a Royal Australian Air Force contingent to this part of the  -world in these critical days will be an important gesture, both practically and psychologically. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The inflammatory political position in the Middle East is as full of danger at present as it has been at any time since the war ended. Persia is ruled by a fanatic - a prime minister swaying, weeping, gesticulating and gyrating like a hobgoblin in a ballet. Egypt is in the throes of a revolution, and who can say that after having rid themselves of a corrupt and contemptible monarch the Egyptians will achieve in any real degree a better government than the one that is now passing away. </para>
          <para>All must agree that Great Britain is in a state of virtual impoverishment, and that the time has long past when England could act the part of policeman of the world. Nothing exemplifies its parlous condition more than the recently reported serious dilution of the United Kingdom defence vote. In spite of ite difficulties the United Kingdom is making a great contribution to the defence of Western Europe which is, indirectly, the defence of Australia. The United Kingdom is assisting to consolidate Australian security by suppressing the Communist uprisings in Malaya. We have only to ask ourselves what our position would be if Great Britain withdrew its forces from Malaya and directed General Templer and his men to the strategic areas of the Suez Canal or Cyprus. </para>
          <para>I was pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition refer to the valuable experience that the Royal Australian Air Force would gain by being sent to the Middle East. Every serviceman and ex-serviceman in this House must agree that there is no training substitute for actual service operations. If the British Commonwealth is to remain strong in these troublous times, if we are to perpetuate it as a reality and not use the term simply as a peroration in speeches, then each of the partners must be generous and forthcoming in mutual assistance to the utmost of its capacity. Our own military reputation in the eyes of the world - and I think that the claim can he made without appearing boastful - is such that immediately the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> announced some months ago that the Royal Australian Air Force would be represented in the Middle East, British diplomacy was strengthened in that area. The announcement caused intense satisfaction in Great Britain where it was considered to he a practical earnest of Australia&#39;s resolve to shoulder its fair share of Empire defence. </para>
          <para>In support of the Anglo-American approach an attempt is being made to bring into being, in co-operation with Turkey and France, a four-power Middle East Command as a solvent of the impasse with Egypt over the matter of the Suez Canal. There is ample evidence to show that such a move is in the interests of not only Great Britain, hut also Australia. I hope that our squadrons will remain in the Middle East for as long as circumstances demand and that if the situation worsens within the next few weeks, as it may well do, they will be promptly supplemented by whatever aircraft and, if necessary, ships and troops it is within our power, and commensurate with our safety, to send forth. </para>

            <para>.- The problems of the defence of the world are very serious. There is a global problem, but each individual area has its own problem. Our country has a most serious problem to face. I do not disagree with, anything that has been said about the value of the training of No. 78 Squadron overseas. Together with a number of other honorable members, I visited Darwin, enjoyed its salubrious winter climate, saw much and spoke to many people. The honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Towner)</inline> has expressed the hope that Australia will, if the occasion demands, reinforce its squadrons overseas. I emphasize that if trouble occurs we must do something to defend our own empty north. From Geraldton on the west to Townsville on the east there are scarcely any units of the Royal Australian Air Force. In Darwin to-day there is one Dakota, one Wirraway and one Lincoln ; and I remind honorable members that it cannot be said that to the north of Australia lies a quiet and settled part of the world. If what the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> said at the Australia, New Zealand and United States conference yesterday, has validity, and I believe that he was speaking not in an exaggerated way but in the light of known facts, there is a danger of war in the Pacific. There could be a war in the Pacific without there being a war in Europe. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Korean war, which strangely enough has not yet been designated as a war by the .Americans, or many other people except the South Koreans, could be repeated in other parts of the Pacific area, and it is possible that our northern territories could be endangered. According to the recent statement of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> we have air squadrons in Malaya, the Middle East and Korea. Nobody has offered any objection to Australia&#39;s participation in operations in those areas, and nobody has objected to the advantages that will be obtained by Australia&#39;s participation, in combined defence training with the Royal Australian Air Force in Malta, Cyprus or other parts of the world. However, there is a need for sending to the north some of the squadrons that are training in the southern part of Australia. The unit that has gone to the Middle East will train under European conditions. I believe that because of our large and diverse continent units of the Royal  Australian Air Force should have some training in tropical conditions. Instead of having a parody of an air force of three machines in northern Australia - and I understand that there is only one pilot capable of flying both the Wirraway and the Dakota - I believe it t&#39;o be incumbent upon us to ensure that we shall have reasonable forces training in  the northern part of Australia against the possibility that very early in the future we may have some reason to call upon their services. </para>
          <para>During the last war the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> secured the services of three Royal Air Force Spitfire squadrons, which performed gallantly and successfully in the defence of northern Australia. This gesture of the Australian Government is in the nature of a reciprocal offer to be of service to Great Britain in a troubled part of the world in which both Australia and Great Britain have interests. I do not say anything in derogation of what has been done, but I emphasize that we cannot neglect our empty north, or leave defenceless our coastlines which extend for almost 6,000 miles. The Leader of the Opposition has suggested that perhaps we should have air force units training at Townsville or Cairns. I believe that in the area from Geraldton to Darwin we should occasionally train some men. There is a number of quite worthwhile air-strips, still in usable condition, between Darwin and Katherine. There are excellent strips near Wyndham, such as the one at Argyle Downs, where there was a Royal Australian Air Force station during the war. The morale of the handful of Australians in that area would be strengthened if it were used extensively for training purposes, and an indication would be given to the rest of the world that the north of Australia is not so defenceless as it may seem to be. I.  read recently a newspaper report that a member of the Australian Country party had said at a conference in Queensland that the Dutch were permitting 2,000,000 Indonesians to enter Dutch New Guinea. That is a grave warning to us, if there be any truth in it. We must pay attention to the defences of northern Australia unless we want to invite trouble. The Royal Australian Air Force units that have served overseas, particularly in Korea and in Malaya, have suffered casualties. Great losses have been sustained by all branches of our armed forces that are engaged in the Korean venture. The sympathy of every honorable member is with the relatives of the men who have lost their lives and of those who have been wounded in Korea. </para>
          <para>I hope that the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon)</inline> will announce to the Parliament at a later date that greater use will be made of the Royal Australian Air Force in the northern part of Australia and also, perhaps, that combined aerial and naval operations will be conducted in that region. The residents of that part of the continent have not seen an Australian warship since the end of World War II. The sole naval vessel at Darwin is a motor launch, and only five officers of the Royal Australian Navy are stationed there. A frigate should be sent to those waters regularly, and opportunities might also be taken to send H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> or some other major unit of the Navy occa sionally. Apparently the naval authorities find it desirable to send large forces to Melbourne and other ports on special occasions. It might be a better idea to let the people of Australia and some of our near neighbours know that we have an efficient navy and a worthwhile air force. Such displays of our defensive power would give great encouragement to those Australians who might well be called the wardens of the outer marches and who would bear the first brunt of any attack upon this country should war break out again in the Pacific. </para>

            <para>.- I am glad to note that honorable members generally support the policy that the Government has adopted in sending a fighter wing of the Royal Australian Air Fore? to the Middle East. I also agree in principle with the view expressed by the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> in favour of the defence of the northern part of Australia. Nevertheless, I remind him that the general world situation to-day does not include an immediate threat to the north of Australia. The honorable gentleman appears to have overlooked that fact. Any threat that may develop against the northern part of our continent must approach Australia through South-East Asia. Although everybody knows that the northern area of South-East Asia is still in a state of turmoil, and that some regimes might  tumble without offering much resistance to aggression, the fact is that the danger to Australia is remote. That situation is likely to remain unchanged for a considerable time. The honorable member for Melbourne spoke of a rumour that large numbers of Indonesians were to go to Dutch New Guinea. No evidence in support of that, rumour can be obtained from any reliable source. Well-informed authorities do not believe that many Indonesians have gained entry to that territory, and I remind the House that Dutch troops are stationed there. All known facts indicate that there has been no infiltration of Dutch New Guinea and that there is not likely to be any such infiltration in the forseeable future. </para>

          <para>There are two practical reasons why Australia, should main taru a fighter wing in the Middle East. The first, which <inline font-style="italic">w:t&#60;</inline> mentioned hy the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline><inline font-style="italic">is</inline> that the members of the unit -will be able to obtain there the best practical training that can be  obained  in the world at present. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that <inline font-style="italic">urah,</inline> training should he carried out iri Australia. I remind him that the mem.bers of the Australian wing will train with members of the Royal Air Force  and  other operational forces from the United Kingdom that are now based on Cyprus. The experience that they will gain there must be far more valuable than any experience that they could gain in Australia. They will be rubbing shoulders constantly with men whose knowledge of warfare is much more advanced than is ours. They will be able to learn a great deal of what is being r ought in air force circles in Great Britain to-day. </para>
          <para>The second practical reason is that thesending of the wing&#39; to the Middle East gives a clear indication to the world of our interest in that theatre. We have shown that our interest in the Middle East is just as great to-day as it ever was. and! that ifr will remain so in the future. The honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Downer)</inline> spoke  of the strategic importance of the. Middle East, not only as a bastion of defence against Russia, but also as n source of oil. The- honorable member for Melbourne neglected&#39; to mention the fact, although I am sure that it was in his mind&#39;, that about 40 per cent, of the world&#39;s oil supplies comes from the Middle East and that Australia depends heavily upon those supplies. Merely from that  stand  point, the Middle East is of first-class- importance to us. </para>
          <para>Outstanding events of recent weeks have emphasized the importance of the Middle East in the general world  strategic  situation. We know what has happened in Persia. Conditions there are-  chaotic  and have given rise to the very grave* danger of a Communist coup.. Every honorable member must the&#62; awa-re that: the advent: of a Communist power in the region of the Indian Ocean would&#39; giverise to serious dangers for us. The. same dangers could arise in Egypt. We do not know bow the situation in: that countrywill develop. Its Government has been upset and revolutionary forces are- ar work. There rs a. constant- danger- that (i subversive power, such as that of coinmunism, will gain control of Egypt..  For  the reasons that I have stated, Australia! must show its interest in the Middle- East by maintaining forces- in the area. I shall not attempt to forecast developments, but at present I am heartily in. agreement with, the policy of the Government. Will the Arab, countries in the: Middle East form the base from which, our defence forces will operate:? 1 cannot answer that question now. Itmay become necessary for our defence forces to move north from Cyprus and to transfer- our main line- of defence from Egypt to: Turkey or Greece, or to both: of those countries; I whole-heartedly support the: policy of declaring our interest in the. Middle East by sending forces&#39; to that region. </para>

              <inline font-style="italic">,.- T</inline>agree with the general view of the House that the Government has acted correctly in despatching, a wing of the Royal Australian Air Force, to the Middle East.. That unit, in that situation, represent* an important part of the Empire defence, plan. I was particularly interested in the comments of the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Downer)</inline> on the state of turmoil in the Middle East, which has persisted  in one form or other throughoutrecent history. He drew a rather clever and entertaining picture of the weeping Mossadeq- of Persia, but his  analysis  of the qualities of leadership in the Middle East was, perhaps-, not strictly accurate. In the Middle East, one must- be able- to cry like Johnny Ray in order to be successful, and&#39; the Persian Prime Minister has wept&#39; his way in and out of power with great success. I daresay that, on an- historic occasion in this House tonight, there will be further weeping&#34; that mav have similar repercussions- in due- course. The decision of the Australian Government to contribute to a general defence programme to safeguard the crossroads of our world trade and to protect our legitimate interests in peace-time is commendable and has the support of the Opposition. The calibre of the Royal Australian Air Force squadrons that are now on service outside Australia - No. 77 Squadron at  Iwakuni  and No. 78 Squadron in the Middle East - is of a high order. They are composed of  exceptional  mcn under exceptional leaders. &#91; met members of No. 78 Squadron when  they  were stationed in Japan, and I am confident that they will worthily represent our air force in the Middle East. The honorable member for Angas spoke of the need for special training of Royal Australian Air Force units and. the honorable member for Melbourne, on behalf of the Opposition, suggested that the 1 Government arrange a system of reciprocal training between the Royal Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force. Wa should welcome unit3 of the Royal Air Force in Australia, especially as that service already has intimate knowledge of the difficulties of defending our vulnerable north. </para>

          <para>The scope of the debate has been extended in order to canvass the question whether we should draw in our frontiers and stabilize them in the southern hemisphere or should reach out into the Old World. The issue is highly debatable. Strategy until recently was of the nineteenth century vintage, but that was blown to bits by the atom bomb. Although our forces may serve usefully in distant territories whore danger to the Empire is likely to arise, we are being obliged by events to turn our eyes nearer to home. A complete change has taken pla.ee in the views of the Labour move.ment on the subject of the defence of Australia as a result of World War II. and more recent developments. What will happen to the vulnerable continent of Australia in the event of disturbances spreading from China and elsewhere in Asia? lt is of no use for us to think in the old-fashioned way and to say, according to the book. &#34; This can&#39;t happen here&#34;. The fallacy of that attitude hai been clearly exposed. I do not object to the deployment, of Australian forces overseas where units are established at present, but it will be useless to maintain such defensive establishments unless we have a solid defence system in Australia. </para>
          <para>It would be dangerous to mention names in a discussion of this character, but I am sure that, should the situation deteriorate, our struggle will take place much closer to home than China or Japan. The blanket of islands to the north of us houses a polyglot collection of races that are <inline font-style="italic">becoming</inline> increasingly nationalistic in their outlook. Should anything happen to convert their nationalism to communism, battle would be joined with enemies only 1,000 miles away from Darwin, not 5,000 miles away in Japan. The planners of our military strategy, under any government, must think deeply and prepare wisely so that we shall be able to combat any such menace if the necessity to do so is thrust upon us. I believe that during this century our ability to hold this country will be tested. Therefore, I have modified many of my views upon defence. I want our defences to be strengthened wherever possible, and the greatest consideration given to the most effective development of our meagre resources of man-power. This country, more than any other nation in the world, needs the complete co-operation of other democracies. Australia has at all times, irrespective of the government in power, shown itself to be willing to do everything it can do to assist the defence of the Empire, at any point of the Empire. The history of the last two world wars shows that Australians have fought all over the world in defence of the interests of the Empire. </para>
          <para>Now that the axis of war has shifted from Europe to Asia, we are entitled to consider the problems with which we should be faced if. war broke out. Australians have always suffered from a feeling of insecurity because of their lack of numbers. That is written- into our history. Our literature is studded with references to a wide, empty and lonely land, and expresses the fear that some day someone will take it from us. Because we have proved that we are prepared to discharge our inter-Empire and international responsibilities, we are justified in asking the great democratic nations to assist us to preserve the integrity of our country by giving to us the benefit of their knowledge. It would be useful if, not in times of war or other emergency, but now, units of the Royal Air Force were operating in close cooperation with units of the Royal Australian Air Force&#39; in places that may be the battlegrounds of the future. We must face the ugly fact that this is a period, not of peace, but of adjustment prior to another conflict unless we do something to prevent that conflict from occurring. In those circumstances, defence is the keynote. Long-range policies are being enunciated, and the new theory is that, with the advent of the atomic bomb, our best means of defence will be aircraft and swift naval craft. Therefore, we must endeavour to achieve the most comprehensive cooperation with British forces, especially the Royal Air Force, when we are making plans for the defence of northern Australia. </para>
          <para>I believe that the majority of Australians agree that these fine airmen of ours should be where they are, protecting  one  of the trouble spots of the world and standing guard in the ever-disturbed Middle East, and that we should encourage a reciprocal move with the object of being helped to strengthen our defences in areas in which we might be attacked if we were to become involved in a war. I believe that to be in the mind of the Government. The debate has shown that honorable members appreciate the international aspects of defence. The presence of these men in the Middle East, a long way from their homes, shows that we are prepared to co-operate in any inter-Empire plan of defence. Therefore, we have a strong claim for the co-operation of other democracies in the planned defence of this country, especially of the vulnerable northern areas about which the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> has spoken. </para>

            <para>.-! am pleased to know that honorable gentlemen opposite agree that this Fighter Wing should be sent to the Middle East. The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> referred to the weaknesses of our defences in the north of Australia, and said he believed that we should send a squadron or squadrons of the Royal Australian Air Force regularly to the north to carry out exercises there in conjunction, if possible, with the Royal Australian Navy. When we are considering the recent discovery by the honorable member for Melbourne of the weaknesses of our defences in the north, we should take into consideration some of the things for which honorable gentlemen opposite  are responsible. They are responsible for our lack of defence, in the north. I refer particularly to Man us Island. If Indonesians are infiltrating New Guinea, and if New Guinea and the northern portions of Australia are in danger to-day, the responsibility for that state of affairs lies at the door of honorable gentlemen opposite. We should not need to be so concerned about having combined exercises in the Darwin area if there were an American base on Manus Island, and if the Americans were there under the conditions that they offered to us originally. Let me inform the honorable member for Melbourne, if he does not already know it. that at least twice a year No. S2 Wing of the Royal Australian Air Force, which is stationed at Amberley, Carrie^ out exercises based on Darwin, Townsville and even on Momote on Los Negros Island. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that at the present time the Royal Australian Air Force is doing everything possible to train the members of its operational units for the defence of Australia. Last April, I paid a short visit to Malaya as a member of the Active Reserve of the Royal Australian Air Force. During the course of that visit, I was able to see the work that is being done by the two squadrons of the Royal Australian Air Force that are operating in Malaya. One is a transport squadron, and the other is a squadron of Lincoln bombers. We in Australia should be proud of the efficiency with which those squadrons are doing the work that is given to them. I should not like to attempt to assess the value of that work to the operations against the bandits of Malaya. It is almost impossible to assess the value of the assistance that is being given to the ground forces by units of the Royal Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force. In Malaya, at the present time considerable numbers of ground forces are employed upon the task of containing and, I believe, gradually getting the upper hand of a comparatively small number of Communist bandits. Comparatively small air forces are being used to assist the ground forces. </para>
          <para>A part of our duty as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations is to assist other members wherever we can do so. By contributing to the effort in Malaya, probably we are contributing to the immediate defence of Australia and, in addition, are giving to our service personnel there an opportunity to further their training under nominal active service conditions. For the Air Force, they are not really war conditions in the true sense of the word, because our airmen encounter no air opposition and the only opposition from the ground forces is scattered small arms fire. Nevertheless, the conditions under which our squadrons are operating in Malaya provide them with better training than they could get in any operations in Australia. The squadron of the  Royal  Australian Air Force in Korea is doing wonderful work to assist the United Nations forces. In Malaya, we are assisting the British Commonwealth directly, and the United Nations  indirectly. In Korea, we are assisting the effort of the United Nations directly. By sending a Fighter Wing to the Middle East, we shall serve a twofold purpose. First, our airmen will get the benefit of training under conditions that do not obtain in Australia, and also will learn from the other air forces with which they are working. In some instances, they will be able to pass on information about techniques and methods used by the Royal Australian Air Force which are slightly better than those of other air forces. Secondly, we shall maintain our link with the other nations of the British Commonwealth and play our part in the preservation of a commonwealth o&#39;f nations that must continue to exist if the democratic system of government is to be maintained. </para>
          <para>The Citizen Military Forces have instituted a scheme under which officers of that force who volunteer to do so will be able to spend three or five weeks in Korea and learn what is happening there, so that the citizen soldiers of this country may become acquainted with modern methods of warfare. I believe that that arrangement could be extended, on a somewhat limited scale, to members of the Active Reserve of the Royal Australian Air Force. In time of war, the majority of members of the Australian forces are not members of the permanent forces. Our permanent forces constitute the nucleus upon which a vast expansion takes place. If more members of our citizen forces were given an opportunity to see foi themselves what is happening in Korea and to pass on that knowledge to their fellow members, the forces concerned would derive considerable benefit. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline> asked what would happen to Australia in the event of another war. That is something that only the future can tell. I believe firmly that if war broke out and Australia were threatened by an enemy, our air force would be our most important arm of defence. Every airman who gains experience overseas and is kept in continual semi-operational training will be able to play a very important part in the defence of this country. Every man we can train will be needed in the event of an immediate threat to Australia. The Royal Australian Air Force is attaining a fairly high degree of mobility. The fact that we had forces in the Middle East would not affect the defence of Australia materially for although we had squadrons in Malaya and in other places also, squadrons of the Royal Air Force based in the Pacific area would be directly concerned with the defence of Australia in an emergency. So, although Australian forces are being committed to overseas tours, forces from other countries are available to us in compensation. I wish to make only one point in relation to the despatch of Australian airmen to the Middle East. The Royal Australian Air Force is short of trained personnel, and by allowing one wing to go to the Middle East we have given to the Royal Australian Air Force in Australia a difficult task. I am sure that it will be equal to the task but the expansion  of the Permanent Air Force and of the Active Reserve will not be made easier by the departure of a section of the Royal Australian Air Force overseas. &#91; support the despatch of the wing to the Middle East, however, because I believe that it will serve a useful purpose and that the men will be able to secure valuable practical training. </para>

            <para>. - I am in favour of the step that has been taken, as is every other honorable member who has spoken, much as I regret the necessity to send men of the armed services abroad in any conditions. It is, perhaps, timely to remind ourselves of the responsibilities that Australia has accepted, through this Government and the Government which preceded it, in relation to our allies. Australia has strong friends and if the worst should happen, it expects powerful support from them. We expect to have the assistance of large American forces if we should be threatened and we look to our friends and relatives in the British Empire also for considerable aid. We can rely on that assistance. But we must remember that, in our turn, we also have definite commitments. Therefore, I applaud the step which is the subject of this debate because it shows that we recognize our commitments and are doing something to honour them. In reviewing the overall defence picture, however, I cannot believe that our contribution is realistic or that it is in proportion to the help that we expect our allies and friends to give to us should war come. What have we to put into the field? What can we raise in the air, on the sea, or on the land to defend ourselves or to support our allies on some front overseas? It is all very well for certain gentlemen to talk about &#34; a million Anzacs &#34;. Where are they to come from? In Australia, we have only 16,000 men in the military forces who can be sent abroad. It is useless to talk about national service trainees because they cannot be sent overseas. The only effective army that Australia can send abroad if necessary consists of 16,000 men. That is totally unrealistic and an inadequate contribution for Australia to make at a time like the present. </para>

          <para>I- believe that the squadron which has been sent abroad is to be based on Malta. &#91; hope that it will not be moved to Cyprus. We have very few real friends in the international sphere, but among the firmest and the truest are the Greek people. Rightly or wrongly, the Greeks regard Cyprus as a part of the Greek nation and very bitter feeling has grown between the Greeks and the British over the British occupation of Cyprus. I do not understand it and I do not intend to discuss the rights or wrongs of it. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> doubt the British have good reasons in their opinion for retaining their hold on Cyprus. But the Greeks have proved themselves to be true and firm friends of Australia, and if we were to land our troops in Cyprus they would consider such a move a great affront. They would believe that Australia was &#34;taking a stand in opposition to what they believe to be their legitimate claims. Commanders have the responsibility of disposing their forces in the best possible way, but the duty of politicians is to bear in mind foreign relationships. I have the warmest regard for the Greek people and I should be sorry if the Government were to take any action that would lessen the regard in which the Greeks normally hold the people of this country. </para>

            <para>. - I rise to support the statement that is before the House. Since I have been a member of this Parliament, I have urged constantly that there should be wider exchange of men of the services with other countries. I believe this to be a step along those lines and consider that it should have the support of every thinking member of this House. On a personal plane, I am pleased that a friend of mine, Wing Commander Eaton, has been appointed to command the wing thai has been sent abroad. In- the interests of proper training, it is essential that air crews shall have an opportunity to get experience of a semi-operational type. Undoubtedly favorable conditions for that training will exist in the Middle East. I believe that the Government has done a wise thing in sending the airmen to the Middle East. As honorable members have rightly said, it is not particularly comforting that we have to act in this way at this time, but I believe that it should have the full support of the House. </para>

          <para class="block">Evatt) for the generous approach that he has made to the problem that is being discussed. It is the approach that &#93; should have expected from one who took such a prominent part as he took in the formation of the United Nations ideals.  His  suggestions with reference to the training of United Nations personnel and, in particular, of the United Kingdom and Australian squadrons will be examined.I shall ask the Air Staff to do so and to decide whether the suggestion can be put into effect. I had intended to make a statement about the movement of No. &#39;78 Wing, but the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Downer)</inline> took the words out of my mouth and has not left mo much to say. I endorse whole-heartedly all his remarks about the Royal Australian Air Force. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Galwell)</inline> emphasized that something should be done for the empty north of Australia. I cannot agree with his suggestions. The strategy that is generally adopted by the defence forces of the Commonwealth is to keep our enemies as far from our. shores as we can. We have established a base on Cocos Island, we have an air force and a naval base on Manus Island, two squadrons in Malaya and a first-class airfield at Garbutt. It is not necessary to base forces at Darwin because various units can get all the operational training they need in the other areas I have mentioned, and can be moved to Darwin at short notice. I do not think that the honorable member&#39;s fears are justified, or that his suggestion deserves very much consideration. It is highly improbable that Communist forces could send a fleet of aircraft against Australia at the present time, and for. many years to come. They should have to move much farther south before an attack by air could become a probability. There is a possibility, however, and we can guard against it. In the last six months the chiefs of staff have considered the problem and have forwarded their appreciation of it to the Government. Such problems change, as the honorable member for Melbourne has said they do, and I&#39; think that we are justified in claiming that within the course of the last six months they have changed to our benefit. I do not want to say too much about Malaya for security reasons, but we can claim that the position there has improved considerably. So also has the position in Australia indirectly. </para>
          <para>Combined exercises are beingconducted to the limit of our ability. Some elements of the fleet are shortly to visit Manus Island and within the last few months large scale exercises have been carried out by the air force. A. squadron of bombers was engaged in extensive exercises which were perfectly executed, and met with the approval of the Chief of Staff. I appreciate the tone of this debate. In my opinion, defence should &#39;be placed above party politics and I am pleased to note that party politics have not intruded in this instance. </para>

            <para>. - My formal task tonight is to place before the House estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 1952-53, and to explain the Government&#39;s plans for financing its operations. It has now become traditional and with a budget totalling nearly &#163;1,000,000,000, perhaps inevitable that the budget speech should deal also with the impact of the budget, and of the measures associated with it, on the progress and prosperity of the country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am presenting this budget much earlier than usual. There is ample reason even in normal times for the Government to present its financial plans  to Parliament early in the financial year, and we hope that this practice may become the rule rather than the exception. At the present time it is more than usually important that the Parliament and the people should know without delay the financial course the Government intends to follow during the coming year. For these reasons special efforts have been made to expedite and shorten the usual budgetary processes, and Parliament has been called together for a budget session much earlier than would otherwise have been necessary. </para>

          <title>This Economic and Financial Situation</title>
          <page.no>66</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Last year the Government budgeted for a surplus and to do so secured increases in taxation, both direct and indirect. Side by side with increased taxation, we maintained controls over capital issues and credit and took steps to encourage certain kinds of imports to make up deficiencies in local production. We did these things quite deliberately as counter inflationary measures, and for very good reasons. In the preceding financial year national income had risen by ?820,000,000 or 36 per cent. Wool prices had averaged 144d. per lb. Retail prices had risen by 19 per cent, and wholesale prices by 27 per cent. In much the same period the basic wage had risen by 37 per cent. Acute shortages of labour existed all over the country. The long-standing bottlenecks in coal, iron and steel, transport and power were becoming worse. Production was&#39; falling in vital industries, especially the rural industries. </para>
        <para>Since the last budget dramatic changes have occurred in basic economic conditions. Wool prices fell to approximately half the level of the year before. Imports of every description flooded into the country so that, notwithstanding the drastic restrictions imposed in the later months of the trade year, the total landed cost of the imports brought into Australia was more than ?1,200,000,000. Our international reserves fell in consequence by. nearly ?500,000,000. In the earlier months of the year severe droughts and hush fires devastated large areas of the country. Later floods have taken their toll of rural production and added to its costs. </para>
        <para>These factors in combination brought about a remarkable change in the economic scene. They threw many unexpected and heavy strains on the economy, but at the same time removed many elements in the wave of accidental prosperity which in 1950-51 bade fair to engulf us. They assisted also to lessen the extreme inflationary pressure from which we were suffering. </para>
        <para>We can at this stage point to many signs that our basic position is far sounder than it was a year ago. For example, in the first six months of this year output of black coal was almost 20 per cent, greater than in the same period of 195.1. Output of basic steel products has increased substantially. Labour shortages have disappeared in most districts and industries, whilst most of the basic industries have gained more labour. The railways are now moving more goods traffic, the turn-round of ships at ports is faster and congestion at the wharves has eased. Few, if any, consumer goods are short to-day; competition is more active among traders and in some lines heavy stocks are held. All this has been accomplished without detriment to a rapidly expanding defence programme. </para>
        <para>It is true that what is called &#34;cost inflation &#34; continues. Under our closely geared industrial system, rising wages and costs tend to become self-propelling. Wage and price increases that occurred months ago produce wage and price increases to-day. It would, however, be idle and wrong for me to discuss here issues which, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court, of Conciliation and Arbitration, and it could only prejudice the work of that court to promote an irrelevant and impotent political debate about them in this House. </para>
        <para>We have with us other characteristic results of inflation. For one thing, inflation always discourages saving and the investment of savings in  fixedinterestbearing  securities, and so the loan market has become weak. It has become impossible to finance reasonable and necessary works programmes without recourse to sources other than the public loan market. To make matters worse, public works programmes have been so overoptimisticallly planned in the period of inflation that any contraction necessarily tends to produce a problem of transitional unemployment. Again, industries which expanded too rapidly now find that, with a levelling off in monetary demand, their products are increasingly hard to sell. The same is true of industries in which costs have risen faster and further than in other industries. </para>
        <para>Building is probably the outstanding example of this difficulty. Such good progress was made with housing that the number of dwellings being completed passed the rate of 80,000 a year. At the same time, however, costs have been forced up inordinately so that the purchase of a home has risen beyond the reach of more and more people. As a result, there is a strong tendency for people to hold off purchasing homes in the hope that a reduction in costs will make it more financially practicable for thom to do so. In consequence the number of commencements of new houses began to fall. In the March quarter of this year some 18,800 new houses were commenced throughout Australia compared with 20,700 in the preceding quarter. </para>
        <para>This fall in housing commencements has not been due to bank advance policy or to any diminution in the. provision of housing finance by Commonwealth authorities. Last year the Commonwealth Government and its agencies made available some &#163;70,000,000 for housing finance. This year it will provide approximately &#163;80,000,000. </para>
        <para>Business in a number of directions has passed into a phase of slackness and uncertainty. This is not so much due to a deficiency of purchasing power, which still remains high and could, if financial errors were made, easily produce new inflationary pressures. Rather is it due to a general hesitation,&#34; to a reluctance of people to buy at present prices when there is any prospect that prices may come down. The existence of large unsold stocks of imported goods in Australia, and the knowledge that the overseas prices of many of these goods have fallen, continue to produce a &#34;holding off&#34; on the part of consumers, and difficulties of finance for those holding the stocks. There is thus a mood of indecision as to whether investments should be made now or deferred for a period until the outlook clarifies. </para>
        <para>These being the circumstances of the time, the Government has given much careful thought to the lines which the budget ought to follow on this occasion. Clearly, we have not the same compelling reason now that we had a year ago for seeking a large budget surplus. We did so then to reduce the pressure of excessive money demand upon a limited supply of goods. But national income in money terms, while it increased last year, did so only by 4 per cent, as compared with 36 per cent, in 1950-51. Meanwhile the supply of goods has been greatly increased by the flow of imports and also in some fields by increased local production. There are, indeed, signs that present demand for some types of goods is inadequate to absorb the supplies available and, in consequence, some unemployment has emerged here and there in the economy. We are thus not any longer dealing with facts like those of a year ago. There are very important differences. Unless these are understood, the structure of the budget proposals I am about to unfold may not be clearly seen. </para>
        <para>A year ago there were 139,000 vacancies for jobs registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service, and no more than a few hundreds of people drawing unemployment relief, almost all of them for special and temporary local reasons. To-day the registered vacancies have fallen to 32,000 and, while unemployment is still sporadic and, I believe, transitional, the number of people on relief has risen to something over 12,000. </para>
        <para>A year ago the monetary situation was radically different. The amount of special deposits then held by the trading banks with the Commonwealth Bank stood at a total of &#163;526,000,000. To-day the total is only &#163;195,000,000, the amount released by the central bank during the year having been no less than &#163;331,000,000. </para>
        <para>A year ago we had just concluded a year of record wool prices, which had seen an addition of &#163;380,000,000 to our export income, with far-reaching consequences. To-day we have had experience of a year of sharply reduced wool prices, with a reduction in the wool cheque: of no less than &#163;300,000,000. </para>
        <para>A year ago relatively few people were disposed to look ahead, to guard against economic dangers, to encourage steps to steady down the inflationary boom. Today, there are hundreds of thousands who have become apprehensive of the future. </para>
        <para>Even more important still is the great change of attitude on the part of business nien. A year ago many believed that monetary demand for goods would go on increasing at a tremendous rate so that ready markets would be found for almost anything that -could be produced or imported from abroad, and large and easy profits made in the process. A very different outlook prevails to-day and there is in some quarters a good deal of fear about the economic future. I believe it to be basically unfounded, but the fact that it exists is something we - cannot ignore. Psychology i9 enormously important in economic affairs and can never be safely disregarded. </para>
        <para>Looking back on the past year the Government is convinced that the counter inflationary financial measures taken in, and in conjunction with, last year&#39;s budget were broadly correct and well justified. For example, we increased taxes to produce &#163;160,000,000 of additional revenue, intended as a means of securing a large counter-inflationary surplus. It was doubly fortunate that we did, for in the event the State works programmes, which we had underwritten to ensure the continued progress of essential projects, actually cost us, out of Commonwealth resources, substantially the equivalent of our increased tax revenue. I -pause here to mention the rather ironical fact that, though in the economic sense we were acting entirely correctly in the national interest, politically we made the worst of both worlds. For our increased taxes, levied, as it turned out, exclusively on behalf of the. States, earned us much criticism. But some of the larger States, so far from acknowledging the value of our immense and timely aid, have clone little but complain that we did not do more. </para>
        <para>After studying the situation ex.&#39;haustively and weighing all the factors to which I have referred, the Government has decided, to base its budget foi&#39; 1952-53 on the following broad considerations : - </para>
        <para>First. - There is still inflation in the sense that prices and costs are rising, even though this is partly a delayed effect of price and cost movements which took place some time ago. There has also been some loss of business confidence leading to hesitancy about investment, and some transitional and sectional unemployment has appeared. We are, therefore, making certain adjustments and proposing certain reductions in taxation which will serve as an incentive to investors and business men and to the community at large, We are making these reductions, as the figures will show, to the  very  limit of our budgetary capacity. We arc not, however, proposing to go into deficit to make them, for to do so would be to prejudice economic stability. </para>
        <para>Second. - We do not on this occasion intend to finance State works out of Commonwealth revenues. Indeed, if the state of the loan market and the willingness of the people to save and invest would permit us to do so, we would have justification for financing pui&#34; own Common-: wealth capital works from loan sources and not from the&#39; proceeds of taxation. These Commonwealth works and services themselves exceed &#163;100,000,000 .in this financial year. It is not practicable to apply this principle at present, but by the same token we can no longer agree that the large and costly works programmes of the State governments shall be charged against the current revenues of the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para>Third. - We consider it justifiable, in the light of the change in economic conditions as compared with a year ago and the emergence of some signs of unemployment, that loan raisings for essential works of a truly developmental and productive kind should receive some special assistance from bank credit. </para>
        <para>To state the matter in another way, we intend to reduce taxation as far as the Commonwealth budgetary position makes possible, but we are not going into deficit for the purpose of reducing taxes. </para>
        <para>The shortfall in terms of cash will be outside, the budget and will relate solely to the needs of State programmes which ave under State control. Im brief, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, we will (his year meet all the Commonwealth expenditure, including our own capital works and services, out of the revenue of the year, after making the substantial tax adjustments to which I shall shortly refer. This means that in this budget we have endeavoured, and I. believe successfully, to reconcile prudence and responsibility with encouragement to enterprise and a checking of certain recessive tendencies in business and employment which, if left to themselves, might cause much damage. </para>
        <para class="block">Expenditure  Estimates.. 1952-53. &#91; said just now that the Government proposed to make tax reductions up to the limit of its budgetary capacity, and I shall now take up the question of what capacity we have on the basis of current estimates of revenue and expenditure.

        <para>Total payments to the States are estimated at &#163;177,S00,000 this year compared with &#163;160,900,000 in 1951-52. The main reason for the increase of &#163;16,900,000 in this item is to be found, in the combined total of the tax reimbursement grant and the special financial assistance grant which it is proposed to pay to tha States. As determined under the formula embodied in existing legislation, the tas reimbursement grant would amount to about &#163;108,800,000. Since this would not meet the needs of the -States - it would in fact be &#163;11,000,000 less than the total of the two grants made last year1 - the Government decided after discussion with the Premiers to make a special financial assistance grant of &#163;27,100,000. Legislation to authorize this grant will be brought down later. As the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission has not yet been received, the amount included in the Estimates for special grants to South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania this year is loft at a sum equal to the grants paid in 1951-52. </para>

Taking higher costs into account, this represents a substantial reduction, in the volume of works activity. Within the total estimates, &#163;28,300,000 is provided for post office and broadcasting works, compared with &#163;29,100,000 spent last year, &#163;28,000,000 for war service homes compared with &#163;27,600,000 spent last year,. &#163;13,600,000 for the Snowy Mountains Authority, compared with &#163;10,400,000 last year, and &#163;6,700,000 for civil aviation works compared with &#163;6,400,000 last year.

        <para>It is proposed to amend the relevant legislation to provide that the amount to be appropriated to the National Welfare Fund in this and subsequent years shall be equal to expenditure from the fund. Under present arrangements the annual appropriation to the fund is related to variations in collections of pay-roll tax. Whilst this has so far had the result that payments to the fund have been greater than expenditure from it this mainly because of the steep rise during recent years in wage and salary earnings in respect of which pay-roll tax is levied it could obviously cause the fund to run down if the rise in earnings slowed down while expenditure from the fund continued to increase. </para>
        <para>The proposed arrangement will have the advantages that annual expenditure on social service benefits will be fully covered by the annual appropriation and the amount of that expenditure will be accurately reflected each year in the budget. Meanwhile the position of the fund will be fully protected. At the 30th June last, the balance in the fund stood at &#163;185,000,000. At that figure it provides a most ample reserve and safeguard for the continued payment of social service benefits, which was the purpose for which it was originally established. </para>
        <para>The total expenditure from the fund this year is estimated at &#163;164,179,000 and that is the amount for which provision is made in the Estimates. </para>

          <page.no>72</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>For many years the basis of taxation of the undistributed income of private companies has been the subject of controversy both as to the weight of the tax and the complications of the system. </para>
        <para>At present a private company may retain portion of its distributable income without incurring undistributed income tax on the amount so retained. This amount, called the &#34; retention allowance &#34;, ranges from 50 per cent, of the first &#163;1,000 of distributable income down to 10 per cent, of the excess of the distributable income over &#163;10,000. </para>
        <para>Commencing with the income year 1951-52, the Government proposes to increase the minimum retention allowance to 25 per cent. Where the present retention allowance exceeds 25 per cent, the greater amount will still apply. </para>
        <para>The new scale will be as follows :  - </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="218331195208066_42_0.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para>The new scale of retention allowances should enable all private companies to plough back the necessary reserves for the proper conduct of their businesses, and at the same time to effect sufficient distributions of profits to shareholders to avoid undistributed income tax. Where, however, a private company chooses to retain profits in excess of the retention allowance, undistributed income tax will be payable. </para>
        <para>Past experience has amply demonstrated the need for simplification of the method by which this undistributed income tax is assessed. The complexities and delays of the system mainly arise from taxation of undistributed income ait the shareholders&#39; graduated rates. Troubles have arisen also because of the inability of companies to check the accuracy of the assessments made. In addition!,, serious complications have been encountered, in ascertaining whether, for purposes: of rebate, the profits so taxed were subsequently distributed. </para>
        <para>Acting upon <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> recommendation of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation, the Government proposes that the undistributed&#39; income tax shall, in future^ be levied at a flat rate instead of the shareholders&#39; graduated rates of tax. The flat rate now proposed is lGs. in the fi. </para>
        <para>Having in mind the greatly increased retention allowances which will be allowable to private companies, and upon which only the primary rate will be payable so long as they remain undistributed, it is not proposed to provide any rebate of the flat rate tax chargeable on distributable profits over and above the permitted retention allowances. </para>
        <para>The basic reasons foi: this proposal are that a company which so retains profits is assumed to be retaining those profits permanently in the capital structure of the company and that they will not be distinguishable, from other retained profits in any subsequent distribution. </para>
        <para>There will be no obligation, on private companies to incur undistributed income tax even although they may find it necessary to utilize profits in excess of the retention allowances. As the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation has pointed out, these companies will be able in most, if not all, cases to arrange for shareholders, after paying their taxes, to re-invest the balance of the dividends with the companies. </para>
        <para>The plan proposed, it is thought, will provide a simple and stable system for the levying of tax on. the undistributed income of private companies. Whilst providing full equity for private companies, it will prevent the delays now so prevalent in ascertaining full liability on any year&#39;s profits and will provide a welcome simplicity enabling companies to ascertain their liabilities at the earliest date. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The Government has also examined the position of transactions in trading stock, including live-stock. The broad principle on which those provisions are based is that, on a disposal of. trading stock, its value should be taxed in the hands of the person or persons disposing of the stock and, correspondingly, allowed as a deduction to the person or persons acquiring the stock. </para>
        <para>Recent decisions of courts and boards of review have disclosed that the existing provisions do not give full and proper effect to that basic principle. As a result, the provisions operate inequitably in regard to some cases of disposals of trading stock outside the normal course of business. It is proposed to introduce amending legislation to remove these anomalies. </para>
        <para>One proposal is that, where trading stock is disposed of by way of gift, the donee should be entitled to the same deduction as a purchaser, and the donor should be taxed in the same manner as a seller of that stock. This provision will commence to apply to gifts of trading stock made in the current year 1952-53. </para>
        <para>The position in regard also to partnership transactions involving trading stock will be clarified. One view previously held was that the transfer of interests in partnership assets, including trading stock, was a constructive sale. In accordance with this view, partners have been taxed on the market value of stock even though there has not been a realized profit out of which the tax could be paid. </para>
        <para>It is proposed that partners should be given an opportunity of electing, if all the parties unanimously agree, whether tax should be payable on the profit deemed to arise from a transfer of interests in trading stock or whether the tax liability should be deferred until the stock is actually sold. The proposed legislation will be made retrospective to 1st July, 1950, so that partners who have been taxed on profits deemed to have arisen from transfers since that date may elect, upon unanimous agreement, to have their assessments amended on the alternative basis now proposed. </para>

        <para>It is proposed to make substantial reductions in the rates of sales tax payable on certain classes of goods. The maximum rate of tax will be reduced from 66&#167; per cent, to 50 per cent., and goods now subject to the maximum fate will benefit accordingly. Toilet and cosmetic preparations and toilet requisites, which have hitherto borne tax at the rate of 50 per cent., will in future be taxed at the rate of 33$ per cent. The tax on sporting equipment and toys and radio receiving sets will be reduced from 33$ per cent, to 20 per cent. Reductions are also proposed on numerous other  clases  of goods. The rate of 25 per cent, will be eliminated. The number of rates of tax in operation will be reduced from six to four, namely, <inline font-style="italic">12i</inline> per cent., 20 per cent., 33$ per cent, and 50 per cent. This should afford some relief to those engaged in commerce. </para>
        <para>Certain further exemptions are also proposed. The most important of these is the. allowance of full exemption from sales tax in respect of goods for use by universities and schools which are not conducted for profit. Hitherto such&#39; institutions, other than government schools, have enjoyed only a limited exemption of scientific equipment and goods for use for the purpose of tuition. They will now he entitled to exemption of such goods as sporting equipment and general furnishings. The allowance of full exemption is in line with the Government&#39;s general policy to assist education. </para>
        <para>The opportunity is also being taken to remove a number of anomalies arising out of the existing classifications of goods for sales tax purposes. </para>
        <para>In terms of revenue, the concessions proposed involve an estimated loss of &#163;6,000,000 in a full year or approximately &#163;5,200,000 in the financial year 1952-53. Specific details of the changes proposed will be given in legislation to be introduced later. The new rates will come into force as from the commencement of business to-morrow, 7th August, 1952. </para>

        <para class="block">Commonwealth Finance fob States. </para>
        <para>Events of the past year have brought acutely to a head the entire problem of Commonwealth-State financial relationships. A fundamental change in prevailing arrangements is obviously necessary. Last year the Commonwealth provided for the States no less than &#163;314,000,000 and by far the greater part of this had to be provided from revenue. This year it will again have to find for the States at least as much as last year, and it should be pointed out that all but a minor part of this enormous sum will be spent on purposes for which the Commonwealth has no direct responsibility and over which it has no administrative control. Clearly the position is radically unsound. The Commonwealth lias to raise enormous sums of money for expenditure outside its own constitutional field; the States meanwhile spend vast sums .for the raising of which they, as governments, have no responsibility whatever. </para>
        <para>The Government, therefore, regards a recasting of these arrangements as imperative and as a first step it has informed the States that it is prepared to put them in the position again to raise revenues for their own purposes from income taxation. From time to time all the States have stated that they desire income-taxing powers to be returned to them and it now becomes a matter of working out a basis for arrangements under which the major source of revenues can <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> shared between the Commonwealth and State governments. It will of course be -one of our objects to avoid documentary duplication and provide the utmost simplicity for the taxpayer. </para>

        <para>The Government will take an early opportunity during the present session to  amend  the legislation which regulates the relations between the Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks. It .also proposes to review the legislation which determines the relationship between, the central banking activities of the Commonwealth Bank .and its trading sections. While there are many minor respects in which alterations to the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945-1951 .and the Banking Act 1945 are long overdue, the main objects of the proposed amendments will be  to  remedy certain dangers inherent  in  the current provisions relating to the special account system, and to ensure that the trading activities of the Commonwealth Bank do not involve unfair competition with the trading banks. </para>

        <para>The development of adverse conditions in the loan market^ due principally to the inflationary forces operating in the economy, has made it impossible for governments to borrow at the comparatively low rates of interest which prevailed during the war and post-war years. All governments, whether Commonwealth or </para>
        <para class="block">State, are naturally reluctant to pay increased rates of interest but the trend towards higher rates is world wide, and in their borrowing operations governments must recognize the realities of the market situation. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth Bank recently reviewed rates of interest in the light of increases in the coupon rates and market yields on governmental and semi governmental securities in Australia and also of the rise in rates of interest in London. In the result, as already announced, the order made by the Commonwealth Bank under the National Security (Economic Organization) Regulations fixing maximum rates of interest for bank advances and a number of other commercial lending operations has, with the approval of the Governin cut, been revoked. </para>
        <para>In current circumstances the Commonwealth Bank does not wish to take further action to fix maximum rates. The trading banks have, however, agreed to observe 5 per cent, per annum as the maximum overdraft rate and not to pay on fixed deposits of various terms more than the rates announced by the Commonwealth Bank. The previous maximum hank overdraft rate was 4&#163; per cent, pui&#39; an num. </para>
        <para>In harmony with this rise in overdraft and fixed deposit rates, it has been decided to increase the rate at which the Commonwealth Bank discounts treasury-bills for the Government from &#163; per cent, to 1 per cent, per annum. Similarly, the interest which the Commonwealth Bank pays to the trading banks in respect of the moneys which they hold in special account at  the  Commonwealth Bank has been raised from 10s. per cent, to 15s. per cent, per  annum. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth Savings Bank has also made an all round increase of 5s. per cent, in the rates of interest on deposits. As from 1st August the! Commonwealth Savings Bank will pay 2&#163; per cent, per annum up to &#163;500 and 1 j per cent, per annum on &#163;501 to &#163;1.000. </para>

          <title>The Balance of Payments</title>
          <page.no>77</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>During 1951-52, Australia&#39;s international currency reserves fell from fiS4fl.000.000 to &#39;.&#163;362,000,000- a drop of no less than &#163;481,000,000. </para>
        <para>A drain of this magnitude on our external reserves in a single year is quite without parallel in previous experience What is more remarkable is that it should have taken place in a year when seasonal conditions were relatively good and when wool prices, although reduced from the  extraordinarly  high levels of 1950-51, were nevertheless higher than for any other period before that record year. </para>
        <para>Although this fall in wool prices wy.* of course, a major &#39;element in the se vert balance of payments problem which developed at the end of 1951, the main cause of this problem lay on the import side. Beginning with the middle of 1950-51. the monthly rate of imports began to rise steeply and, by the middle of February, it was clear that, unless restrained, total imports for 1951-52 were likely to be of the order of &#163;1,100,000.000 f.o.b. or more than &#163;1,200,000,000 when payments for freight and insurance were included. This would have meant that by the 30th June last our international reserves would have been well below &#163;300,000,000 and we would &#39; have now been facing the possibility of their  being  virtually exhausted by the end of 1952. </para>
        <para>In such circumstances, the case for placing some check on imports was unanswerable and the Government therefore took appropriate action in that field. However, even with the import reductions announced on the Sth March, the total value of imports into Australia during 1951-52 was &#163;1,050,000,000 f.o.b. or, adding freight and insurance, &#163;1,197,000,000, thus giving an adverse balance of trade for the year of &#163;530,000,000, and, when all other external transactions for the year were brought into account, a balance of payments deficit of &#163;481,000,000. </para>
        <para>Obviously, the international currency reserves of &#163;362,000,000 we have been able to maintain are none too large for our requirements when we know from experience how violent the fluctuations in our overseas trade can be, and we simply cannot contemplate allowing them to fall below the present level for any length of time. For the present this means that at the very most we cannot afford to spend on imports more than we obtain from exports and the proceeds of overseas borrowing or private investment in Australia. </para>
        <para>I am able to say, however, that the import restrictions announced on the8th March are now beginning to become fully effective and, although future developments will need to be closely watched, the immediate problem has been successfully brought under control. Nevertheless, to make our position really safe the level of our international currency reserves ought to be a good deal higher and we must spare no effort to build them up as and when we can. In fact, our longerterm aim must be to rebuild the reserves to a level adequate to meet the wide swings to which, as last year&#39;s experience has dramatically shown us, the Australian economy is so peculiarly subject. </para>
        <para>A further objective must be to reduce our deficit with the countries of the dollar area. In this direction we are making our contribution towards maintaining the gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area, both by the stringent measures we have adopted to cut down dollar expenditures and by renewed efforts to increase our dollar earnings from exports. In addition we have, as already announced, arranged to make a temporary drawing of 30,000,000 dollars, from the International Monetary Fund, and have concluded a new 50,000,000 dollar Loan Agreement with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which will help to finance the import of dollar capital goods for the development of our primary and secondary industries. </para>
        <para>The whole dollarsterling situation will, of course, be considered at the Commonwealth economic conference which is planned to take place in London next November. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Democracy and free enterprise in. the modern world tread a precarious path between the twin evils of inflation and unemployment. In Australia we have had experience of both within the past twenty years. We are, perhaps, the more prone to swing one way or the other because we are a young country with a strong urge to progress, and also because we are so much exposed through the nature of our trade to the impact of world conditions. To find and keep a midway path throws a heavy responsibility upon governments. There can be no more difficult problem than to halt, as we have tried to do, a longcontinued and violent inflation and yet in so doing to avoid an unwanted downturn in economic activity. For it is characteristic of inflation that the longer it goes on and the stronger it grows, the more its features become the accustomed and accepted conditions of economic life. Plans and commitments are built upon the belief that prices will continue to rise and scarcities to persist. When these conditions are brought or come to an end, as they must some time, expectations are falsified, plans go wrong and losses are incurred. Left to run its course, inflation will inevitably bring its own drastic solution in bankruptcies and mass unemployment. It is the task of economic policy so to adjust conditions that neither inflation itself nor the reaction from it will run to extremes. </para>
        <para>But responsibility for a stable course in economic affairs does not rest wholly, nor perhaps even mainly, with governments. After all, the springs of action in an economy such as ours lie principally with business firms and individuals, and so it is principally business firms and individuals who will determine whether there is to be inflation, recession or stability. The Government can influence the broad context within which private enterprise works, but in Australia at least it cannot and should not try to do more than that. </para>
        <para>Last year with inflation at a dangerous pitch, the Government acted with determination to restore balance between demand and supply. Later, as the situation changed, we adapted and modified our measures to new circumstances. We are further modifying them in this budget according to our judgment of what the situation requires. But, because of the dangers that remain, we are certainly not going to throw them entirely overboard. </para>
        <para>I hear talk of depression ; such talk is dangerous nonsense. With export prices high, with the seasons good, with great, defence programmes and works programmes going on, with our population  increasing rapidly, with the worst industrial bottlenecks broken, with taxation lower than in any comparable country, it is clear that the broad conditions have never been more favorable for enterprise. </para>
        <para class="block">At least that is true of the material conditions. It may be that it is confidence and faith we need. If that be so, let us look once again across the face of our country. </para>

        <para class="block">Notes on Revenue and Expenditure 1951-52. </para>
        <para>In the 1051-52 budget, revenue (excluding self-balancing items) was estimated at &#163;1,041,404,000. Expenditure from Consolidated Revenue was estimated at &#163;926,872,000, thus leaving an estimated surplus of revenue over expenditure of &#163;114,532,000. It was provided that this amount would be transferred to the National Debt Sinking Fund thus balancing the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1951-52. </para>
        <para>Actual  revenue for the year proved to be &#163; 1, 002,395,000, which was &#163;.39,009,000 less than the budget estimate. Excluding the transfer to the National Debt Sinking Fund, actual expenditure amounted to &#163;903,895,000 or &#163;22,977,000 less than the budget estimate. The surplus available for transfer to the National Debt Sinking Fund in 1951-52 therefore amounted to &#163;98,500,000. After effecting this transfer, the Consolidated Revenue Fund was balanced in 1951-52. </para>

        <para>Although customs revenue and income tax collections from companies exceeded the estimates by &#163;9,936,000 and &#163;15,809,000 respectively, total revenue fell short of the budget estimate by &#163;39,009,000. The main decreases as compared with the estimates were sales tax (&#163;21,541,000). income tax on individuals (&#163;32,806,000), wool deduction (&#163;5,537,000), pay-roll tax (&#163;2.830,000) and post office revenue (&#163;3,129,000). </para>
        <para>Despite a decline in the rate of imports in the latter months of 1 951 -52 the value of imports reacheda record level in that year. Correspondingly there was a record collection of customs revenue. The main imports which contributed to the excess of &#163;9.930,000 over the budget estimate were textiles, metals and machinery, tobacco and cigarettes. Collections of income tax from companiess reflected the record level of company incomes in 1950-51 and exceeded the estimate by &#163;15,809,000. </para>
        <para>The shortfall of &#163;21,541,000 in sales tax revenue was due mainly to a slackening in consumer demand. This slackening in demand was particularly marked in relation to less essential types of goods which carry high rates of sales tax. Income tax collections from individuals fell short of the estimate by &#163;32,806,000 principally because of the deferment of provisional taxation to meet the position of wool-growers affected by the fall in wool prices in 195.1-52 and by bush fire and drought losses. Revenue from wool deduction was &#163;5,537,000 less than estimated. Revenue from this source represented carryover paymentsfrom the 1950-51 wool season. Pay-roll tax collections fell somewhat short of the estimate as the rise in earnings tended to flatten out in&#39; the latter part of the year. Post office revenue was a fleeted by some slackening in demand for postal and telephone services. </para>

        <para>Provision was made in the 1951-52 budget for the transfer of &#163;32,500,000 from Consolidated Revenue to the strategic stores and equipment reserve. Expenditure from the reserve during 1951-52 was less than anticipated and amounted to &#163;7,866,000. An amount of &#163;10,049,000 was transferred to the reserve from Consolidated Revenue in 1951-52 to cover this expenditure and certain outstanding commitments. The saving as compared with the.

        <para>The statutory appropriation to the National Welfare Fund was &#163;13,070,000 less than estimated because pay-roll tax collections (on which the appropriation is based) fell short of the Budget estimate. </para>
        <para>Expenditure on miscellaneous services was &#163;5,743,000 less than estimated principally because of a saving of about &#163;5,000,000 in expenditure on international relief. Some countries did not seek assistance under the Colombo plan during 1951-52 whilst difficulties of procurement delayed the supply of materials to Pakistan. There was a saving of &#163;500,000 in expenditure on the Korean civil relief programme which could not come into operation because of the continuance of hostilities. </para>
        <para>Expenditure on bounties and subsidies fell short of the estimate by&#163;1,505,000. Expenditure on the coal subsidy was &#163;3,091,000 less than the estimate because imports of coal were lower than was anticipated. Largely because of a fall in overseas tea prices, the tea subsidy was &#163;2,173,000 less than estimated. On the other hand, no provision had been made in the budget estimates for the bounty on stock -feed wheat which cost &#163;2,368,000 during 1951-52 while the subsidies on dairy products cost approximately &#163;1,000,000 more than estimated.

        <para>During . 1951-52 the receipts of the National Debt Sinking Fund were &#163;161,401 , 000 including the sum of &#163;98,500,000 referred to below. As a balance of &#163;10,282,000 was carried forward from the previous year, a total of &#163;171.683,000 was available for sinking fund purposes. Of this amount &#163;36,425,000 was expended in repurchases and redemptions and &#163;125,500,000 was invested in Commonwealth securities. The unused balance of &#163;9,758,000 is being carried forward to the financial year 1952-53. </para>
        <para>In November, 1951, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the National Debt Sinking Fund (Special Payment) Act which authorized the Treasurer to pay to the National Debt Sinking Fund, out of Consolidated Revenue Fund, such sums as he determined not exceeding in the aggregate &#163;114,500,000. The amount actually paid into the fund under this act was &#163;98,500,000. This sum plus an amount of &#163;27,000,000 received in respect of the 1 00,000,000 dollars loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development was invested in Commonwealth securities on 30th June, 1952. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Customs</inline>(Item 1). - The lower estimate of customs revenue in 1952-53 as compared with collections in 1951-52 is, of course, due to the heavy reduction of imports through the restrictions imposed in March this year. Some of the severest restrictions apply to. goods bearing the higher rates of duty. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Excise</inline>(Item 2). - The increase in revenue from excise allows- for the fact that the increases in duty on beer, spirits and tobacco imposed in the budget last September will apply for a full twelve months in 1952-53. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Hales Tax</inline>(Item 3). - Some price  increases  cun lie expected during the year and a number of the sales tax increases imposed in the last budget will operate throughout 1952-53. On the other hand, buyer resistance and the effect of import restrictions will tend to reduce sales and revenue collections. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Services</inline>
          <inline font-style="italic">Contribution</inline>(Item 4 and ti). - Total wage and salary earnings and therefore instalment deductions from salaries and wages are expected to be higher in 1952-53 than in 195 1-52. The amount of arrears collected this year should also be greater than last year and wool deduction credits allowed in 1952-53 will be very much less than in 1051-52. On the other hand, wool incomes in 1951-52, on which Income Tax will be assessed this year, were approximately half the incomes of 1950-51. Costs also rose during the year and growers suffered losses through droughts, floods and bush fires. Furthermore, the large provisional tax debits against assessments issued in 1951-52 will be brought into account as credits this year and will, in general, more than offset the tax actually payable on 1951-52 incomes. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax - Companies</inline>(Item 5). - The estimate of revenue assumes some increase on the average in company incomes in 1951-52 as compared with 1950-51. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Railways</inline>(Item 14). - Revenue in 1952-53 is estimated to exceed revenue in the previous year by &#163;691,000 due mainly to increased traffic resulting from the introduction of diesel-electric locomotives , on the Trans-Australian railway. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Post</inline>
          <inline font-style="italic">Office</inline>(Item 15). - Estimated revenue of &#163;63,000,000 in 1952-53 is &#163;3.629,000 higher than revenue in 1951-52. The main factors increasing revenue are the installation of new telephone and other services, and the increase in population. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Interest and Sinking Fund.</inline>- The amount of -&#163;59,349,000 provided for interest and sinking fund in 1952-53 relates only to Commonwealth war debt. The increase is due mainly to the normal accumulation in the sinking fund charges. Total debt charges on Commonwealth  war  and civil debt are estimated at &#163;69,398,000 in 1952-53 as compared with &#163;67,533,000 in 1951-52. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">War Pensions.</inline>- Actual expenditure in 1951- 52 was &#163;33,566,000. The estimate of &#163;35,879,000 allows for the proposed increases  in rates of wa.r and service pensions which are estimated to cost &#163;2,154,000 in 1952-53. The estimate also allows for an increase in the number of pensioners  and  for the full? year effect of the increased rates which operated from October, 1951. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-style="italic">Repatriation.</inline>- Estimated expenditure in 1952- 53 is &#163;1,655,000 greater than actual expenditure in 1951-52. The principal causes of the increase lire the rising cost of maintaining repatriation hospitals, the proposed increases on the rates of medical sustenance and allowances under the soldiers&#39; children&#39;s education scheme and the full-year effect of the increase in allowances payable to certain war widows, which operated from October, 1951. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Reconstruction and Rehabilitation.</inline>- Expen diture in 1952-53 is estimated at &#163;2,759,000 - an increase of &#163;243,000 as compared with 1951-52. The principal increase relates to war service land settlement, the provision for which from Consolidated Revenue is &#163;1,131,000 greater than last year. This is due mainly to writing off excess costs of holdings acquired and developed under&#39; the scheme although the provision reflects also the increase now proposed in living allowances for settlers. On the other hand, expenditure under the reconstruction training scheme is expected to decline substantially in 1952-53 despite the proposed increases in living allowances. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Miscellaneous.</inline>- The estimate for 1952-53 is &#163;1.324,000 or &#163;302,000 lower than in 1951-52. Expenditure in 1951-52 included, however, a grant of &#163;250.000 to the Prisoner-of-war Trust Fund. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Credits.</inline>- Receipts from disposals and other credits are included in the miscellaneous revenue of the relevant departments in 1952-53 instead of as a deduction from war and repatriation expenditures. Credits from other administrations .are estimated to total &#163;2,000,000 in 1952-53 due mainly to receipts under the pool arrangements for British Commonwealth Forces in Korea. </para>

        <para>In each year from 1947-48 to 1949-50, the National Welfare Fund Act provided for the payment from Consolidated Revenue to the National Welfare Fund of a sum equivalent to the collections of pay-roll tax and social services contribution. With the amalgamation of income tax and social services contribution in 1950-51 it became necessary to devise  a <inline font-style="italic">new</inline> formula for determining the amount to be transferred to the National Welfare Fund each year. </para>

The a mount paid to the National Welfare Fund in 1951-52 under this arrangement - &#163;171,709,000 - was &#163;39,029,000 greater than that amount paid in the previous year.- </para>

The amount actually transferred in 1951-52 was &#163;98,500,000 and waa invested by the sinking fund in a special Commonwealth loan of &#163;160,000,000 to provide finance for the States&#39; works programmes in 1951-52.

        <para>The increase of &#163;6,014,000 in the estimates for 1952-53 as compared with actual expenditure for 1951-52 reflects provision for higher Wages a.nd salaries and other costs. The detailed estimates of each department do not provide for the effect on departmental wages and salaries of any basic wage increases which may bc made during 1952-53. An amount of &#163;2,250,000 has been included, however, in the 1952-53 estimates of the Department of the Treasury to cover the estimated increase in departmental wages and salaries resulting from the increase in the basic wage which takes effect in August, 1952. </para>
        <para>The Department of Civil Aviation&#39;s estimates show an increase of &#163;1,074,000 which is due, apart from cost and wage increases, to increased payments in respect of domestic and international airmails and to increased expenditure on the operation and maintenance of airways and airports resulting from the installation of additional equipment and the assumption of responsibility for more aerodromes. </para>
        <para>The estimated increase of &#163;373,000 in respect of the Health Department arises mainly from additional staff necessary for the administration of the medical benefits scheme and expansion of existing health benefits, and from quarantine measures against foot and mouth disease. </para>
        <para>The estimated increase of &#163;486,000 in expenditure on Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is due partly to increased costs and partly to some expansion in research activities. </para>

        <para>The estimated increase of &#163;190,000 in expenditure on Miscellaneous Services by the Prime Minister&#39;s Department arises mainly through an increase of &#163;150,000 in the Commonwealth grant to the National University and increased expenditure under the Commonwealth scholarship scheme. </para>
        <para>The reduction of &#163;1,524,000 in the amount to be provided in 1952-53 under the Miscellaneous Services votes of the Department of Immigration, reflects the decision of the Government to reduce the rate of intake of migrants. </para>
        <para>Of the amount of &#163;4,488,000 provided for international development and relief in 1952-53, &#163;3,750,000 relates to the contribution to be made by Australia under the Colombo plan to assist the countries of South and SouthEast Asia with their economic development programmes and to provide them with technical assistance.

The provision for stores and materials is &#163;1,356,000 higher, because of increased costs, and the provision for mail services is &#163;520,000 higher, due to increased contract prices.

Legislation was passed in 1947 and in 1948 amending the basis for determining the aggregate grant. Under the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act 1946-48 the aggregate grant was fixed at &#163;40,000,000 in 1946-47 and &#163;45,000,000 in 1947-48, whilst in respect of subsequent years the Act provides for the aggregate grant of &#163;45,000,000 to be varied in accordance with a formula which takes account of- </para>

        <para>The need of the States for further revenue grants over and above the amount payable under the tax reimbursement formula in 1952-53 was discussed at a Premiers Conference held in July, 1952. The Premiers were informed that the Commonwealth would be prepared to make a supplementary grant sufficient to bring the total payment for 1952-53 to &#163;135,000,000. As the amount payable under the tax reimbursement formula in 1952-53 is estimated at &#163;108,800,000, this offer involved a special financial assistance grant of approximately &#163;20,200,000. </para>
        <para>This amount of approximately &#163;20,200,000 will be distributed among the States in the same way as the tax reimbursement grant payable in 1952-53. It is proposed, however, to pay further amounts to Victoria and Tasmania sufficient to give these two States the same amounts which they would have received if the additional payment had been distributed in the same way as the special financial assistance grant paid in 1951-52. It is estimated that the additional payments .to Victoria and Tasmania will amount to approximately &#163;900 000 thus increasing the special financial assistance grant in 1952-53 to &#163;27,100,000 and the total payment to &#163;135,900,000. The Premiers agreed with this proposal, the effect of which is shown below.

      <para>At this meeting the Commonwealth made an offer to the States in the following terms: - &#34;First, we are prepared to assist the States by arranging for special subscriptions to Commonwealth loans raised for Loan Council programmes up to a maximum of &#163;125,000,000. </para>
      <para>Second, we are prepared to vote for a Loan Council borrowing programme equal to the sum of that amount of special Commonwealth assistance, the net amount of new money that we estimate the public loan market will yield in 1952-53, and the amount of domestic loan raisings. This sum total we estimate at approximately &#163;180,000,000. </para>
      <para>Third, until after the result of the first loan raised in 1952-53 is known, we shall be prepared to make monthly advances to the States on that basis, after taking into account carry-overs at the beginning of the year. </para>
      <para>Fourth, if the&#39; result of the first loan should indicate a more healthy loan market, we shall be prepared to consider monthly advances which would accord with the reasonable expectations from the loan market. </para>
      <para>Fifth, this offer is made on the clear understanding that all demands for advances under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement will be included in the Commonwealth borrowing programme, and that the total of such demands will be a charge against the sum total of &#163;180,000,000 referred to above. </para>
      <para>Sixth, should the States choose to approve a borrowing programme in excess of the amount stated above, the Commonwealth will not vote for it but it will do its utmost to raise the maximum possible amount from the loan market, but without assuming any responsibility for raising the total amount voted. </para>
      <para>Finally, should the actual borrowings for the year appear likely, later in the year, to fall significantly short of reasonable expectations (which clearly cannot be set higher than &#163;200,000,000 in- all) the Commonwealth will not raise objections to the States reducing the amounts proposed to bc   carried-over  &#39; at 30th June, 1 953, to <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> total of approximately &#163;12,000,000 &#34;. </para>
      <para>In the result, the Loan Council, with the Commonwealth dissenting, approved a total borrowing programme for 1952-53 of &#163;247,500,000. During the discussion the Commonwealth undertook to explore the possibility of arranging finance to the extent of a further &#163;2,000,000 over and above the figure of &#163;.125,000,000 to assist Western Australia in meeting its special loan difficulties in 1.952-53. </para>
      <para>The Loan Council met again in Jul}&#39;, 1952, at the request of the Premier of Victoria, supported by the Premiers of New South Wales and South Australia. At this meeting the Commonwealth agreed to arrange further finance to the extent of &#163;8,000,000 to bo used for advances to the States under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. The Commonwealth has therefore agreed to arrange special assistance in respect of the Loan Council programmes in 1952-53 up to a maximum amount of &#163;135,000 made up as follows: - </para>

An amount of &#163;17,458,000 was also approved for other semi-governmental and local authorities. </para>

          <para>The incidence of sales tax has been closely examined in the light of current economic conditions, and with due regard to representations received from many sources for relief from the tax in respect of various classes of goods. It is considered by the Government that, in the changed conditions of to-day as compared with twelve months ago, a reduction of sales tax on some classes of goods is desirable. </para>
          <para>Since September, 1951, the tax has been imposed at six rates 12&#189; per cent., 20 per cent., 25 per cent., 331/3 per cent., 50 per cent, and 662/3 per cent. The top rate of 662/3 per cent, and the rate of 25 per cent, are being eliminated, so that the maximum rate will now be 50 per cent., and there will be only four rates in operation 12&#189; per cent., 20 per cent., 331/3 per cent, and 50 per cent. This reduction of the number of rates will be welcomed by the merchants concerned as a step in the direction of simplifying the work of classification of goods and the preparation of sales tax returns. The rate of sales tax on sporting, goods and toys, and on wireless receiving sets, is being reduced to 20 per cent, from the present rate of 331/3 per cent. Cosmetics and toilet preparations generally are now to bear tax at the rate of 331/3 per cent, instead of 50 per cent. Certain toilet requisites which hitherto have been taxed at the rate of 662/3 per cent, will be subject to tax at the rate of331/3per cent. Musical instruments at present are subject to tax at the rate of 25 per cent. The rate is to be reduced to 20 per cent. </para>
          <para>The bill also proposes to reduce the rates of tax on certain other goods, with the object of removing anomalies. The present rate of tax on trays is 662/3 per cent. It has been demonstrated that, for the most part, this classification covers inexpensive articles, which, as such, are not suitable for inclusion in the high rate bracket, on which the rate will still be 50 per cent. It is proposed, therefore, to reduce to 12&#189; per cent, the rate of tax payable in respect of trays, with the exception of those which are made of, or plated with, gold, silver or other precious metal, and those made of cut glass. There has been criticism in the past of the. fact that shopping bags made of paper or string bear the same high rate of tax as other bags. As these are inexpensive goods of a purely utilitarian character, the rate of tax thereon is being reduced from 331/3 per cent, to the general rate of 12&#189; per cent. </para>
          <para>In addition to these reductions of rates, it is proposed to exempt some further categories of goods from sales tax. The most important, is the category of goods for the use of universities and schools which are not established or carried on for profit. At present, complete exemption is enjoyed only by government schools. Universities and other non-profit schools have a limited exemption of scientific equipment and goods for use exclusively for the purposes of tuition. Tax has been payable, on their purchases of ordinary furnishings and sporting equipment, and the effect of the limitation of the exemption has been more burdensome since sporting equipment has been subject to the rate of 331/3 per cent. The position has been further complicated by the fact thai associations of parents and friends established to assist schools have been able to purchase all kinds of goods free of tax for donation to the schools. It is considered that this inconsistency should be removed, and that the complete exemption now granted in respect of goods for the use of these institutions will eliminate confusion and be of material assistance to them. Tax will still be payable in respect of any goods  acquired by them for re-sale, except when the goods are of kinds which are exempt in all circumstances, such as textbooks. </para>
          <para>For many years, there have been strong claims forrelief from tax of goods for the use of agricultural societies. Hitherto,  there  has been a limited exemption of certainspecifiedkinds of printed matter fortheir use. Ithas not been found possible to allow all the requests made by these bodies, but it is proposed now to remove inconsistency by extending the exemptionof printed matter to cover all printed matter fortheiruse, and not for sale. </para>
          <para>Further assistance to the primary producer is being granted by way , of an exemptionofhomelighting plants for the generariaion and storage of electricity and gas, and also of plant for use in draining l and foragricultural purposes. </para>
          <para>Another new exemption proposed appliestoearth-moving machinery and equipmentfor use in the carrying out of contracts withgovernment departments  or  localgoverningbodies. Mostsales of thesegoodsarealready free of tax, as they are largelysold to government authorities,and to persons engaged in mining, quarrying or agricultural activitieswhoare entitled toexemption. The new provision will remove the existing amomalythatcontractors who buy such plantforuse exclusivelyin government contractsbear tax thereon,whilst contractors who buy similar plant exclusively for use in miningor agriculturalwork escapethe tax. Theexemption will not applytohand tools or toroad vehicles of akind ordinarily used for the transport of goods. </para>
          <para>The law at present authorizes exemption of perambulators, strollers, and the ike. The exemption is being extended to perambulator seats and covers, and to bassinettes, cots, cradles and bedding for those articles. Articles of domestic use which are beingbrought within thescope oftheexemptions are toothbrushes and candles. </para>
          <para>The billcontains a number of other amendmentsof relatively minor im- portance,which are designed, in most instances, to remove anomalies or to reinstate certain provisionsin terms which will giveeffect more satisfactorily to the original intention. The concessions allowed by the bill will involve an estimated annual loss of revenue amounting to &#163;6,000,000 oranamount of&#163;5,200,000 for the current year. Details of the goods affected are set out in an explanatory statement which is being circulated for the information of honorable members. Inaccordance with the usual practice in these matters,the amendments will take effect on andfrom to-morrow,the 7th August. I have no doubt that the bill will find favour withhonorable members generally. </para>

            <para>.- I take this opportunity to raise a matter about which several members of the Opposition have tried in vain to obtain information. I refer to the cost of ministerial visits overseas. Ever since I have been a member of the Parliament it has been the practice for governments to furnish, when requested, information about trips of that kind, including the cost incurred. During the last sessional period, several members of the Opposition asked questions with a view to eliciting information about the cost of ministerial trips overseas, but Ministers refused to supply the information. Instead, the Government invited members of the Opposition to move in the House for the tabling of a statement on the matter, knowing full well that, having the numbers, it could so arrange matters that the motion would remain indefinitely on the business paper, and would never be dealt with. I claim that certain members of the Government have been so lavish in their expenditure on their own comfort, and on the comfort of those who accompany them on overseas trips, that they are afraid to disclose to the public the way in which Commonwealth money has been squandered. On these frequently recurring trips abroad members of the Government are in the habit of taking quite large parties with them, and it would seem that Ministers are unwilling to travel unless accompanied by their entire families at Commonwealth expense, as well as the officials whose duty it is to offer advice. From most of such visits the country derives no benefit whatsoever. Indeed, most of them have been no more than junketing parties for Ministers. Let me give one illustration. The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt),</inline> who has again gone abroad, not long ago attended a conference of the Empire Parliamentary Association at Ceylon. On his way back he paid a visit to Malaya, the excuse being that he was to study the tactics of the Communist guerrillas. We have never heard of any report that he presented to the Government on the subject. I suggest that he did not get close enough to the guerrilla fighters to learn anything about their tactics, and that the story was only an excuse to justify the expense incurred. If the Government has nothing to fear it should not hestitate to give full information about ministerial trips. I have been assured from a fairly reliable quarter that the cost of one overseas visit by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> was &#163;80,000, and I have been told that his latest trip abroad cost even more than that. Everybody knows that the country is confronted with an economic crisis, and Ministers are always talking about the need to economize; yet the squandering of public money still goes on. I invite the Government to make a clear and detailed statement regarding ministerial visits overseas since it has been in office the purpose of such visits, the total cost involved, the number of persons who accompanied each delegation and their work on the delegation so that the public can judge whether those visits were justified or not. It is improper of the Government to say to a member of the Opposition who seeks this information that be should take action in the Parliament by way of a motion for the preparation and presentation of a statement. If the Government will give an undertaking that such a motion will be dealt with and that the information will be provided, the Opposition will be prepared to submit it, but why should not the Government provide the information without special action if it has nothing to hide? Previous governments have never hesitated to furnish such information. This Government refuses to do so because it is afraid to divulge the details to the general public. </para>

            <para>. - I believe that the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> has spoken on practically every adjournment motion in the two and a half years that I have had the honour to be a member of this House. On each occasion he has said something extraordinary and, at times, unreasonable; but I think that I have never heard him say anything quite so foolish as that which he has said to-night. He has complained that he has asked on many occasions for details of the expenditure incurred by the Government in overseas visits by Ministers and their staffs.  His  complaint is that the Government&#39;s only answer has been that, in order to get that information, he should table a motion in the House.  His  objection to that course is that the Government will not allow such a motion to be dealt with but will defer it. Honorable members have listened to this complaint by the honorable member for East Sydney for six months or longer. I should think that his case would have been infinitely stronger if he had tabled a motion and the Government had not dealt with it. But, in fact, honorable members know that if n motion is tabled in this House about the expenditure of Ministers and their staffs and families while abroad, it may lead to an investigation far wider and more searching than the particular one to which the honorable member for East Sydney has referred. It might even be inconvenient enough to call to mind recollections of what happened during the tenure of office of the previous Government. </para>

I make bold to say without fear of any contradiction that the Chifley Government was responsible for more frequent, more elaborate and more lavish entertainment of its Ministers and private members at the national expense while they were abroad than any other government of this country has ever conceived of providing. No government other than an oriental despotism could have thought of expenditure on such a scale. </para>

          <para>Me  CALWELL. - The? honorable&#39; membar for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> warde some reference te that speech but; I. shall not: say when as I should be outside the Stand- ing Orders in doing so. I issue this challenge to the Minister: If the Government has nothing to. hide, let it produce all the figures in connexion with all the visits made abroad from the time the Cnr tin Government came into office, providentially for Australia, on the 7th October, 1941. Let the House have all the facts. I was one Minister who went away. I was- absent for twelve and a half weeks- and visited 23 countries. It was the cheapest mission that ever went overseas from Australia and probably the one from which the Australian people derived most benefit. Everything that we did has already been fully explained to the Parliament. When we were in office we answered immediately and fully without the slightest objection every question that related to our doings. This Government has been engaging in entertainment on the oriental scale to which the honorable member for Evans has referred. It is sending. Ministers away from Australia in a continuous procession. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> is reported to have said that every occupant of ministerial office should go overseas at least twice a year. The impression seemed to be engendered that the right honorable gentleman wants to make each occasion a six months&#39; visit. He has already been overseas on- two occasions1, and he is to go overseas again this year. The- Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> went overseas this year and failed, and the Prime Minister followed him to see whether he could redeem his1 failure. Now, both are to- go again, if only to watch each other&#39; in order to discover the degree&#39; to which the other fails. The honorable member for Evans must remember that Labour Ministers&#39; who wen* abroad iri&#39; war-time- travelled on urgent and necessary business&#39; and- under great- difficulties1 and with considerable danger to themselves. The honorable&#39; member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)&#39;,</inline> Ers Minister for Air, went to London twice1 at a time when London was- being heavily bombed.  His  visit was made under great difficulties&#39; and he lived in- England during- the worst period of the bombing. Nobody can say that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer; or the formes Resident Minister for Australia, in, London.1,, who iff mow the Vice-President of the Executive Council, suffered anything more than the &#39;bombardment of Mayfair parties during their stay in London. Nobody can say that the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey),</inline> who seems to be a perennial globe-trotter, his immediate predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spender,</inline> who could not keen out of Australia long enough, 871d other Ministers who continually exhibit the -awful disease of itching feet and cannot remain in Australia for very long, suffered any great hardship during their visits abroad. We &#34;want to know the cost of those visits. &#39;The Australian people are entitled to prompt answers to our questions concerning such expenditure. The honorable member for East Sydney &#39;(Mr. Ward), who has been told that he must move for the submission of a return if he desires the information, knows that if he does so his motion will probably be placed at the bottom of the notice-paper. If the &#39;Government has &#34;no intention so to deal with such a motion there is no reason why Ministers should not answer his questions promptly and fully. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Evans was never more wrong in his life than when he said that the entertainment given by the Labour Government was more lavish and was .given more frequently than that of its predecessors and its successors. I remember that when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> made .a .series of visits abroad the complaint was made against him ;by honorable members opposite, who were then sitting in opposition to .the Chifley Government, and .by some sections of the Australian press,, that .his stay in England was too short land that he came .back to Australia too -soon. In short, &#39; they complained because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> .did .not peregrinate round the Continent and .because his -visits were made solely for business purposes and not for his .own enjoyment .Such a complaint cannot be made about ,any member of the .present -Government. We want to know the cost to the Australian taxpayers of the .visits abroad made by Ministers of the present Government. It -may &#39;be true that much of the expenditure on these &#39;trips .cam. be justified .and that -good value has been obtained from it. I do not oppose the making of overseas visits by Ministers. I realise that they are necessary and that they are undertaken with a certain .-amount of inconvenience and risk and,  in  mm instances, -with great dislocation of tfes individual Minister&#39;s home life and iis responsibilities  in  this country. Usually a Minister does not  go  abroad unless .he is compelled to do &#39;so. Having said that, I return to my main point, which is *hat the Australian taxpayers, through this Parliament, are entitled  to  know the cost of each of these visits. We shall welcome the presentation by the Government  idf  a return which shows the cost -of all such visits from the 7th October, 1941, to the 6th August, 1952. </para>

I want to know -why the Government has refused to give  :to  the Australian taxpayers -who, after all, have  to  foot the bill, the information that I, the honorable member for East Sydney, and other Opposition members have strayed desperately for several months to obtain.

The cost of the visit is shown in the Estimates to have been &#163;19,7.60, but as the honorable member for East Sydney has said the total cost of the party was much more than that. The travelling costs of those who accompanied the right honorable gentleman are shown under other heads of expenditure. It is likely that the total cost was double the amount that I have cited.

              <para>- The honorable member for Henty gives to us further information. That the Prime Minister took with him a valet is surely bad enough. If the right honorable gentleman has so many suits of clothes that it is necessary for him to employ a valet, I am inclined to believe that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> must have disgraced yourself when you went to London. If it was not necessary for you so to encumber yourself with extensive paraphernalia as to warrant the services of a valet, I cannot see why the Prime Minister should have done so. </para>

              <para>- As the Prime Minister also could have worn his, if kilts were an acceptable form of dress, that is no -justification for the right- honorable gentleman&#39;s misgivings. As the honorable member for East Sydney has said, it is also rumoured that the visit of the Prime Minister abroad cost the Australian taxpayers &#163;80,000. That rumour may be false, but, in any event, the Prime Minister should clear the air and let the taxpayers know whether the total cost of his visit abroad, including costs incurred in respect of the nineteen advisers and assistants who accompanied him, amounted to &#163;80,000 or to an amount slightly below that figure. The right honorable gentleman should explain to the taxpayers whether his party engaged a complete floor at the Savoy Hotel in London, as it is rumoured it did; and he should also state whether his party engaged an extensive suite at the Hotel Waldorf Astoria in New York.- It is also important that the right honorable gentleman should tell the people what benefits have accrued to Australia as a result of the expenditure that was incurred in respect of his visit abroad. I am disturbed about the fact that whilst it was estimated in the Estimates for 1951-52 that the sum of &#163;8,500 would be required to meet the cost of the Prime Minister&#39;s visit abroad, and the Parliament authorized the expenditure of that amount for that purpose, nevertheless the final figures show that the right honorable gentleman&#39;s trip cost &#163;19,760 in respect of his personal requirements alone. When the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> was Prime Minister he made several trips overseas but the total cost of those visits - which, at any rate, produced results far more important than those that the present Prime Minister&#39;s overseas trips have produced - was only between &#163;3,000 and &#163;4,000. That figure is in marked contrast with the sum of &#163;19,600, and stands in even greater contrast with the figure of &#163;80,000 which the honorable member for East Sydney has cited. When supporters of the Government were in Opposition they complained that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley,</inline> when he went overseas as Prime Minister , refused to wear knee breeches. What a terrible thing ! </para>

My final point relates to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen).</inline> Whatever this individual&#39;s business overseas might have benn, goodness only knows. But I have discovered from figures supplied to mo from governmental sources that the cost of his visit overseas last year to one conference amounted to &#163;13,132.

          <para class="block">Is it suggested that Australians are less loyal because these Australian athletes went abroad as a team wearing a distinctive Australian uniform? Such  a  suggestion cannot be entertained for one moment. I do not know what the effect must have been in Helsinki when the organizers of the Olympic Games received the cable from the Minister protesting against the playing  of  a distinctive Australian song, even though some persons are not prepared to accept it as Australia&#39;s anthem, and insisting that &#34; God save the Queen &#34; be substituted for that song. </para>

              <para>- There is no more wrong in Australia having a separate flag than there is in Great Britain having the Union Jack. The great majority  of  Australians resent the charge that because they want to have an Australian anthem and an Australian emblem, or flag, they are consequently less loyal to the British Commonwealth of Nations. Incidentally, my conception of the British Commonwealth of Nations differs from that  of  some supporters of the Government, who seem to think that Australia is still  a  colony, tied like a tin can to the tail of the British bull-dog. That is not the conception of the Australian people of this nation&#39;s position in the British Commonwealth  of  Nations. We are an independent unit in the British Commonwealth of Nations and we march side by side with the other members of that Commonwealth. As Australians, we add something distinctive to the British Commonwealth  ot  Nations but we are nonetheless loyal; we look to the Mother Country and to the link that binds us all, that is, the Crown. Therefore, I take this first opportunity to lodge my protest against the action  of  the Minister for the Interior, which was not only unwarranted and indefensible but also repugnant to the people of this country. </para>

          <para class="block">I gaye my faith to some degree- to this Government; But I was led up- the garden  path  and1 was left lamenting.. In April last, after the imposition of restrictions upon imparts,, I wrote, a letter relating, to the importation of cigarettes, to the  Comptroller-General  of:  Customs.  Previously, I had&#39;  communicated.  with, him. by telephone and had. explained that. &#38; certain firm in. my. constituency had&#39; been, importing cigarettes on irrevocable  letters  &#169;&#163; credit, through an. indent  agent.  After the: restrictions had been applied,, the.  head <inline font-style="italic">o&#38;</inline> that:  firm  sought, to obtain 2Q per cent, of his quota of imports of cigarettes, but. the agent replied, &#34; There are no- cigarettes. We have applied our&#39; indent licence under category B for  the  purpose of importing additional quantities- of textiles.&#34;&#39;..  Therefore,  he: got no cigarettes. That was, unfair,, not&#39; only to the distributor,, hut also to the- retailers who depended upon him,, and the smoking public.. It reduced&#39; the quantity of.  cigarettes available,  not by about 30. per sen as the&#39; Government had estimated that it  would,  but by approximately 50. per- cent. </para>
          <para>When I got, into touch with- the Comptroller-General&#39; By telephone lie advised me to, send&#39; to hi&#39;m a letter.. I did so, but got no reply. I then- rang, his office, but to no avail.. After some days had elapsed I again rang, his, office, and! ultimately I received as letter- stating; that unfortunately the  Government  could do nothing, in connexion, with, the matter. I came to the Parliament feeling most indignant, because I considered that this injustice  should  have been  remedied,  that, it, was  contrary to  every- principle that, the G.o&#62;vernment had enunciated om import  restrictions.  In* reply <inline font-style="italic">to&#62;</inline> criticism  of  import  restrictions by  honorable  members on, tins side of the: Boosey Minister- after Minister&#39; stated that,  anomalies  or inrjustices should not be brought up hu this House,, but that, representations should be made, to the- department or Minister concerned, when such, would be remedied. Subsequently I interviewed the responsible Minister, who admitted&#39; the justice of my  claim  and stated, that he would discuss the matter with- his d&#39;epart- mental&#39; officers. In due course I saw the Minister&#39;s secretary who said&#39; to me, &#34; Oh well, everything is satisfactory, we arc going to inform the head of the department that the firm in your constituency should get* the right&#34; to- import the percentage of cigarettes that it rs entitled1 to, that is, 20&#39; per cent of the quantity of cigarettes that it previously imported &#34;. But nothing- happened. I then- endeavoured to- communicate by telephone with the head of the department in Canberra. He was&#39; absent and I had to make efforts to communicate, with him in. various States. Ultimately I received&#39;, a letter from the department to the effect that nothing could be done. </para>
          <para>On the. 1-9 th- May, an article, in the Melbourn <inline font-style="italic">Sun N&#39; ea.ust-Pictoria.il,</inline> claimed that 2.0. per cent, above the correct price of imported cigarettes- was-- being: off ered, to  indentors  to import English! cigarettes- and of course these would be sold ait increased prices. Although other articles  have  since appeared in the Melbourne, press, if nol in the- press of other capitals, to the effect that there is an undue shortage of cigarettes-, and that available stocks, are being sold from und&#39;er the counter, and under other undesirable- conditions, nothing has: been done-. I. pointed ant to the Minister that racketeering of that type would be promoted if he did. not give to the firm that I. have mentioned, its just quota of cigarettes.. He should not have permitted the indent,, under category B, to be switched from cigarettes to textiles,, in order to bring in more textiles than the community needed, thereby putting the smoking, public at a big, disadvantage. That particular kind of textile was one. on. which the firm could make. a. big profit. Neither should the Minister have, permitted certain, big companies, to obtain, irrevocable letters of credit about two days, before, the restrictions were imposed, to. enable them to import large quantities of cigarettes and tobacco from overseas, thereby giving to them an advantage over all&#39; their competitors. The company that I have in mind is Myer Emporium Limited. I consider&#39; that if the Minister for Trade aird Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline> O&#39;Sullivan)  is unable, or unwilling to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Ms- departmental</inline> officers&#39; to do the just and&#39; right thing, within the policy of the Government, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> should instruct him to do so. </para>

            <para>.- I want to add just a few words to the remarks of the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Keon)</inline> concerning the happenings at Helsinki to which he has directed attention. I did not realize how deeply concerned the people were until I noticed in my own electorate a genuine feeling that the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kent Hughes)</inline> had muddled the matter completely. There is no reason why the Minister should not have interpreted the sporting spirit at Helsinki correctly, because he was  a  Rhodes scholar, and sport is within the curriculum that is associated with  a  Rhodes scholarship. That may be  a  long time ago; but he had those qualifications. We are mode to look small in the eyes of the world if a Minister, quite gratuitously, says what tune shall be played to mark an Australian victory at the Olympic Games. Ifhe consideredthat a <inline font-style="italic">faux pax</inline> had been made he should have done something quietly instead of making a great noise about it. There is nothing wrong with &#34;Advance Australia Fair &#34;, I wonder whether, if it had been played under its original title,he would have objected to it?Patriotic Australianssee nothing derogatory to Britain in our singing of a national song, even if its theme originally came from some other melody. The national anthem itself is based on songs that have been sung throughout Europe. It is a fine anthem. There is nothing wrong with the Australian national song, but the thought has been aroused in the minds of the people that although we have some excellent runners, particularly among our women folk, we also have some people who are capable of a wrong interpretation of the sporting spirit that existed at Helsinki. The matter goes deeper than that. </para>

              <para>-Thepoint Iwas about to make is that it is about time that  the  old squirearchy psychology  was  entirely forgotten. There isnothing wrong  with  Australians desiring to sing the best of ournationalsongs. There is  nothing  wrong with&#34; Waltzing Matilda&#34;. It is a fine song based  upon  amarching song that was sung by the soldiers  in  the days of the Duke of Marlborough. It is a fine, invigorating melody  that many  Australians are prepared to  accept  until we can get our nationalmusicians to give to us new words  and  music. The same applies  to  &#34; Advance Australia. Fair &#34;. The  average  Australian, if  asked what  composition he regarded  as  his national anthem, would say &#34;Advance Australia Fair&#34;, because  it had  won his approval. </para>

          <para>All  this  dragging overof the dead  bones of  loyalty is horribly humiliating  forus in  theeyes  of the  world. It is time  we  grow  up.  It is  time  thatour Ministers made responsible decisions, I do not  see  that  any major  crisis should  have  developed because of the playing of </para>
          <para>Advance Australia Fair &#34; at Helsinki. Behind the games the whole spirit was that of international competition. There was a high levelof sportsmanship, I  do  not think that the attitude  of  the Minister was sporty. We have a row about  every  twelve months about our national anthem. Where does  that get us?  We  know  that it is the British nationalanthem. The case I submit  is  that an error was made, but that  it is  unfair to say that  the melody  should not have been played. On subsequent occasions at the games  the  national anthem  wag  played before a  few  bars of &#34;Advance Australia Fair&#34;,  and  naturally that put us back in our place in  the  community of British nations. I regard it  as acase  in which silence would have been golden  and no  action would have  been  the right course. Those things adjust themselves. However, allwe have got out  of  this incident is  a  certain degree of sympathy from the rest  of  the world and the feeling  of  inferiority that  has  been generated  among  Australians, that theymustnever  dare  to be Australians. They must always use their own national flag conjointly with  the  BritishNationalflag. That  is  all right,  so  long  as it is not  overdone. Their national literature must be sponsored by some authority that  is  neither national nor British. This is a return to the position that existed in the days of the Wentworths of the past,  :i  position that could exist to a great degree perhaps in the days of the Wentworths of the future. This is the Commonwealth of Australia. Is there any disgrace in advocating the use of a national song or the holding of national aspirations? If there is, then the Labour party pleads guilty on all counts. But if the matter be judged by the people of this country, they will unanimously find us not guilty. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. KENT</inline>HUGHES (ChisholmMinister for Works and Minister for the Interior) f 10.1 6&#93;.  -  The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Keon)</inline> and the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline> have accused me of suffering from an inferiority complex. Actually, the honorable members themselves are suffering from an inferiority complex, because they arc afraid that if the national anthem  (i  lone - and we have only one national anthem - had been played to mark an Australian victory, people might havethought that it was not an Australian athlete, but an athlete from Great Britain who had won a contest. This matter arises from a complete misunderstanding of the customs that operate at the Olympic Games. When the Empire Games were held, in Australia in 1938, if I remember rightly, the melody that was played to mark an English victory was &#34;Heart of Oak&#34; or &#34;Rule Brittannia &#34;. An Australian victory was marked by the playing of &#34;Advance Australia Fair and a Canadian victory by the playing of &#34; The Maple Leaf Forever &#34;, or some other Canadian melody. Tn any event, the various national songs were played to mark victories. Honorable members opposite can argue among themselves whether &#34; Advance Australia Fair&#34; is the national song or merely a national song. Personally. I have a very great love for all our national songs, of which the honorable member for Parkes lias mentioned only a few. </para>

              <para>-- The honorable member who said &#34; Ah ! &#34; is entitled to his own opinion. He has not been to the Olympic Games, and I tell him that it is the custom for the national anthem of the country of a winner to bc played. Possibly the honorable member does not know that. I personally consider that the solution eventually adopted waa a very good one. That solution was to play the National Anthem first and then the opening bars of &#34; Advance Australia Fair &#34;. To my mind that was a very good solution of the problem. Nevertheless, it remains the custom at the Olympic Games for the national anthem of the country to which a winning athlete belongs to be played, and, as far as I know, and as far as the vast majority of Australians know, there is only one Australian national anthem. </para>

            <para>.- I wish to refer briefly to a matter that has been mentioned before in the House by members of the Opposition during the last few years in questions to the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Townley)</inline> aud during the course of budget speeches, but about which no action has been taken. The Minister for Social Services has been asked on various occasions to have an investigation made of the operation of funeral benefit societies, which are allegedly run for the benefit of pensioners. I, and other honorable members, have frequently brought to the Minister&#39;s notice the fact that those societies, which allegedly work for the benefit of pensioners, arc merely adding to the expenditure of pensioners from their small amount of pension by involving them in weekly payments for which they will get practically nothing in return. The position has reached a crisis in Victoria, where by order of the Chief Secretary, a number of funeral benefit societies have had their operations suspended, their assets paid into a pool, their affairs investigated and their future considerably hampered. Honorable members know, or should know, that the general practice of these societies has been to wait for pensioners on pay days to pester them for subscriptions, in return for which they have guaranteed certain benefits to the relatives of the pensioner in the event of the pensioner&#39;s death. The societies give an undertaking to the effect that they will give a decent burial to a subscriber. To old and lonely people, the thought of being buried in a pauper&#39;s grave is both distressing and humiliating, and consequently age and invalid pensioners have been paying into these funds for many years. The position in Victoria at present is that their return from the premiums that they have paid so painstakingly for years will almost certainly be nil. As a result, such societies in Victoria have been prevented from operating further. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Commonwealth enters into this matter in a very marked degree. As honorable members know, the Chifley Government instituted a funeral benefit of an amount of &#163;10 or so. Prior to the suspension of the operations of the societies in Victoria, it was always the practice of the societies to find that, no matter what sum was to be paid on the death of a pensioner, it always fell short, by the amount of the Commonwealth benefit, of the cost of an allegedly decent funeral. In consequence, the cost associated with the illness of a pensioner which resulted in his or her demise had to come out of the pockets of the relatives, who did not receive the Commonwealth funeral benefit. The way in which some of those poor old souls were buried was :i disgrace to civilization. I speak with some knowledge of this subject, because men interested in the mortician&#39;s trade have told me of the disgraceful coffins that were made for persons whose only means of paying for a burial was the amount of their funeral benefit policy. People who Lave been paying into these societies for years are now confronted with the position that their return from them will be nil, but there are still collectors who  unauthorizedly  wait at pensions offices on pensions pay clays to collect more money from pensioners, although those same pensioners have been told by the Registrar of Friendly Societies in Victoria that future payments will be made at their own risk. These so-called funeral benefit societies benefit only their promoters. </para>
          <para>I raise this matter in this chamber to-night in the hope that the Minister for Social Services will investigate  the  operations of these organization? in other States where they are continuing their activities without check or hindrance. I could cite quite a number of examples. For instance, one society in Victoria, known as  Raybolds,  made a lot of money by collecting funeral benefit contributions&#39; from pensioners. Those payments were supposed to be recorded in a book, but if the book was lost the pensioner did not receive one penny of the money that he had paid in. I pay a tribute to the Government of Victoria for having curbed the activities of organizations such as  Raybould&#39;s  and many others I could name. &#34;While investigating this matter, the Minister for Social Services could also consider the inauguration of a scheme under which the Department of Social Services itself would impose a small charge on pensioners for their burial. For this purpose, contracts could be entered into with reliable funeral undertakers. However, I suggest that any such payment by a pensioner should be optional. By this means elderly people whose only crime is poverty could be assured .of a decent burial without swelling <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> exorbitant  profits  that are made by morticians&#39; societies and by proprietors pf elaborate funeral parlours. Tb.is racket, which has now been eliminated in Victoria, is .still operating in the .o,thor States,  and  I urge that an  early  investigation of it be maie sp that whatever action may lie within the Commonwealth&#39;s power&#34; to remedy the situation may be taken as soon as possible. </para>

            <para>| .10.28  &#93;.-in <inline font-style="italic">refill)</inline> - We have been treated to an extraordinary diversion here tonight. With some pretence of goodwill and facetiousness, honorable members opposite have indulged in a smear campaign against the Prime Minister (MrMenzies). They have  cited  fantastic figures and quoted extraordinary statements in their attempt, in the guise of good fellowship, to throw mud at the  Prime  Minister. I have the greatest respect for my friend - I hope that I may  call  him my friend - the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> who is  Deputy.  Leader of the Opposition in this chamber. Whenever he realizes that his colleague the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> has got himself into rather deep water, he plunges in to the rescue. The choir in&#39; the&#34; background plays its part, tpo, and then the honorable member for  Melbourne says, &#34;I challenge the Vice-President pf the Executive 0911118il  to  produce the figures &#34;. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let us have ?&#62; look at .some pf the figures,  because  they are rather interestnig. The Opposition charges ug with  having squandered  public money, I have before me volume  195  pf <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> which at page 8146  contains some  most illuminating  information  on the subject that lias been  discussed  to-night. It reveals, for. instance, that the, honorable member for East Sydney,  who  has raised this subject to-night, was overseas for a  period  of  four months  at tb.e taxpayers? ex. neil se. The  honourable  member for Melbourne,  who  has so. gallantly railed, to. the aid. qf his colleague, w-as overseas  for a  period of  three  months, and. the honor-, able member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr-. Haylen)</inline> was away for. six month?. The. honor able member for Grayndler (Hr, Paly), who was then the  honorable member for Martin, .apparently got lost on his  journeyings  abroad because ke was absent from this -country for five months. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator P.</inline> M.. .Grant .left Australia for the Unctad Kingdom, Prance and Canada on the 7th May, <inline font-style="italic">194&#163;t</inline> and returned on the 14th June, 1946. But he did not stay here. He left again on the  18th  July, and .did not return until the  28th December  .of that year. On the first occasion, he was absent for one month, .and on the  second  occasion he was away for five months, The .circumstances of these two trips are rather intriguing. The honorable senator was sent to Geneva  to  advise the then Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs, P.r. Evatt, on important legal matters, but after he had been away for only a few weeks he was recalled so that he could record his vote in the Senate. Having discharged that duty, he set off again  to  continue his wanderings as the adviser to the Attorney-General, The honorable senator&#39;s brief return to this country  to  record, his vote Cost the Australian taxpayers &#163;400. Answering a que.st.ipn asked in this House about the  journeyings  of the then honorable member for Martin, the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Chifley,</inline> paid on the 30th October, 19.47-- </para>
          <para>The  honourable member for  Martin  departed from  Sydney l)v flying- boat on the 10th April, 194&#39;&#39;, anil travelled to  Geneva  vin Lyndon.  He  returned to London via Italy. France and Belgium (calling at Mila.n, Genoa. Paris and Brussels), made n short visit to </para>
          <para class="block">Eiro  and  returned to  Australia via.  Canada  ii|ul the United States, </para>
          <para class="block">It is rather ridiculous, therefore, that the honorable member for East Sydney should charge this Government with having- squandered public, money on visits overseas by Ministers and Government Unorders. In 1Q46 and 1947, no fewer than 37 members of the Labour party went, overseas. The present Leader of the Opposition (Pr. Evatt), who was then known as the perambulating Minister for External Affairs, was. overseas for periods of up to five months at a. stretch. Indeed, it may be. said, that he paid periodic visits, to Australia. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> gave details, of over-seas visits in this House on the 3rd December, 1947, his statement showed that the Minister for External Affairs left Australia on the 4th October of that year, and an asterisk placed alongside that date indicated that he was then still abroad. Quite clearly the right honorable gentleman has returned since then because he is now Leader of the Opposition. </para>
          <para>Some Labour travellers seemed to be able to establish themselves very well overseas. I recall that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> so ingratiated himself with certain editors in Ireland that they mentioned, him in their newspapers as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator L&#39;</inline> Amour. I recall, too, that the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> went to Belgium to obtain information about coal. That was the excuse for a trip abroad. The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline> went overseas, and, like the then honorable member for Martin, conveniently got himself lost for five or six months. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> also bad a journey abroad at the country&#39;s expense, and doubtless enjoyed himself thoroughly. The House will remember the former member for Corio, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dedman,</inline> who acquired fame as the man who abolished Santa Glaus, who prohibited the use of pink icing on cakes, and who described as &#34; little capitalists &#34; the persons who own their homes. Did he worry about going overseas at, the taxpayers&#39; expense? Of course not! He was a big capitalist at that time. In 1946 and 1947, no fewer than 27 members of the Labour party enjoyed themselves overseas at the taxpayers&#39; expense. It was generally recognized here that the Labour Government at that time had a roster, and that as one of its supporters was returning to Australia, another packed his bags, picked up his grips, and went overseas. </para>
          <para>As the House and the general public are aware, all this talk about journeys abroad by Ministers of the present Government has only one purpose. The Opposition has to find a way to attack the Prime Minister, and, in this spirit of good fellowship and facetiousness, seeks to smear his name by saying that he perambulates abroad at public expense. He has not spent so long overseas, or travelled abroad so often as did the present Leader of the Opposition when he was the Minister for External Affairs. The Prime Minister has not earned for himself the nickname of &#34;perambulating Minister &#34;. He has not, and he will not, allow members of the Government to fritter away the taxpayers&#39; money, as the preceding Labour Government did when 27 of its supporters went abroad in a period of two years. I inform the honorable member for Melbourne that I shall consider whether it will be in the public interest to make a thorough examination of all the matters that have been raised on the motion for the adjournment this evening, with a view to making clear to the general public the costs of visits abroad by various Ministers and honorable members over a period. </para>

            <para>As with the balance-sheets of all businesses it cannot be said that any particular classes of assets in the balance-sheet of the Central Bank are specifically earmarked or offset against any particular liability, e.g., the special accounts of the private banks. It is of conrse, possible to trace an historical connexion between the acquisition of external assets (including gold) and treasury-bills held by the Central Bank and the subsequent building up of the special accounts. Therefore, if anyassets of the Central Bank are to be regarded as offsetting liabilities represented by balances in the special accounts the main items to be so regarded would bc external reserves and Australian Government treasury bills. </para>
