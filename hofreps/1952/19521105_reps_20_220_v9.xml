                        <para>- Will the Prime Minister indicate whether honorable members will be given the opportunity, before the termination of the sessional period this week, to discuss item S on the notice-paper, which deals with the employment situation, and which has been listed for a couple of months? If such an opportunity is not to be provided, has the right honorable gentleman any announcement to make that will put some hope and encouragement into the hearts of many thousands of unemployed workers and immigrants, a considerable number of whom are m my electorate, so that they will be able to enjoy the festive season in the same happy spirit as other more fortunate sections of the community .and confidently expect a brighter New Year, with full employment and prosperity for themselves and their families? </para>

                            <para>- Is it a fact, Mr. Speaker, that the hairdresser, who worked in 'this House, has left us as a result of his activities in connexion with recent sporting events, and that the premises which he formerly occupied are now vacant? Is it, also a fact that the parliamentary under-secretaries are without offices of any sort in this building? Finally, will you, sir, consider, as a atop-gap measure in this situation, accommodating the parliamentary under-secretaries in the rooms that were formerly occupied by the hairdresser, even though, as honorable members generally will agree, it would bc much better to have hairdressers of experience? </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable member has asked his ' question in a facetious sense, I point out to him that certain very foolish attempts have been made recently to magnify into a national issue a very minor matter associated with the management of Parliament House. T think that the actions of the persons concerned ill become them. No doubt the leader of the honorable member's party will attend to the accommodation of under-secretaries in due course. I have already informed certain persons who have made inquiries about the cutting of hair that, so far as I can ascertain, their needs can he met outside Parliament House. There are other hairdressers in Canberra. In the event that none of them should be working, we could revert to the customs of our ancestors, wear our hair long, curl it, and put it in ribbons. </para>

I understand that a reportfront the Auditor-General on this matter is. also available for presentation to the House. I have prepared a statement which contains an analysis of the position. In due course - I hope during the next sessional period' - amending legislation will be introduced in order to clarify certain points. However, as I do not desire to inflict the matter upon the House, at length, at this juncture, I nsk for leave to incorporate my statement in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I also propose to move that, the paper be printed so that it will be open to debate. The amending legislation may be ready when the House re-assembles after the recess, and in that event we shall not need to have two debates on the subject. However, in the event of the amending legislation not being ready, I desire to conserve the rights of honorable members to debate the matter.

Archie Cameron). - I must again raise the question, which I have had occasion to  raisepreviously, of the wisdom, or unwisdom, of incorporating in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> matter that has not formed a part of the spoken proceedings in the House. In one instance, not long ago, the Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Casey) very much against my wishes, was granted leave to incorporate a certain statement in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> We have had trouble in respect of this kind of procedure. I simply raise the matter again because I think it is my duty to do so. It is also my duty to impress upon the House the necessity for taking a clear stand in respect of matters of this description. I have no desire to prevent the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) from making a statement on the matter, in which I am, to some degree, directly interested. Is leave granted to incorporate the statement in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard ?</inline></para>

                        <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister for Health. Is it a fact that the Queensland Government has now come to an agreement with the Commonwealth with regard to hospitals on exactly the same terms as were proposed to it by the Commonwealth at least eighteen months ago ? Secondly, is it further a fact that this agreement is identical with those already made by the Commonwealth with the other State governments? Thirdly, is it not also a fact that no suggestion was ever made by the Commonwealth to the Queensland Government that would require the imposition of a means test, or otherwise interfere in any way with that Government's management of its public hospitals? Fourthly, are not all statements to the contrary, including those of the Premier of Queensland, mere political' propaganda ? </para>

I recognize some resemblance between the question asked by the honorable member for Oxley, and a question asked yesterday, but I am unable to compare the two and say that they are exactly the same. I point out that if Standing Order 145 is to be interpreted strictly, many of the questions that I have heard during this sessional period have been asked time after time. </para>

That letter stated definitely that the resolution which had been carried unanimously by a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers for Health on the 16th January, 1951, recommended a revision of the hospitals benefits agreement, in accordance with which heads of the agreement were omitted. </para>

All those heads of agreement limited the freedom of action of the States, and, accordingly, the Government was prepared to negotiate with the State governments with a view to drawing up a new agreement which, would be substituted immediately, if the States so desired, for the existing agreement under which those limitations would be completely removed. The limitations concerned means tests and charges at hospitals which were instituted by the Chifley Labour Government. The letter concluded with this statement from the Prime Minister - </para>

It is quite obvious that the question of the honorable member for Oxley was not asked without notice, because the Minister for Health appears to have a typewritten copy of the question in front of him and he is now proceeding to read the second part of the question asked by the honorable member. It is quite apparent that a copy of this question was given by the honorable member for Oxley to the Minister long ago. </para>

                            <para>- The agreement signed by the Queensland Government last Monday is identical in its main operative clauses with the other agreements that have been made with various State governments. The operating clauses indicate two lines of action. The first is that there shall be a proposal by the State Government of a scheme which will be acceptable to the Australian Government and which will ensure that there will be increased hospital revenue in Queensland. Secondly, if the State approves the scheme and implements it the Commonwealth is prepared to pay 8s. a day for each uninsured patient, and 4s. a day for all those who are insured. The  Queensland Government has made a very definite statement with regard to this matter. If any honorable member cares to read the statement made by the Premier of Queensland last Monday, he will find that that gentleman gave instances of the extent to which he -;s prepared to go to increase hospitalization for paying patients in Queensland. The next part of the honorable gentleman's question- </para>

There has been an explicit declaration that that would not be done with regard to any State. Finally, the honorable member asked whether the statements he referred to should be regarded purely as having been made for political propaganda purposes. It has been suggested that the Queensland Government has won some extraordinary fight. I cannot understand where the fight took place because there are no signs of conflict on myself or this Government. The fight must have been conducted within the Queensland Government, hut, the propaganda that it has been putting out is quite false. </para>

                                <para>- Every State government is doing that to a great degree. This matter is entirely one of State policy which is determined by the respective States. Every agreement that has been made with the States has been sufficiently elastic to enable each State to give effect to its own desires and, in fact, to impose different charges even in respect of every ward. There is no reason why any State government should not provide free hospital treatment if it wishes to do so. </para>

I now ask the right honorable gentleman whether he is aware that the South Australian Premier pointed out in the .State Parliament recently that his Government was experiencing difficulty in framing legislation to protect the public against the activities of such companies. He said that there was some doubt whether companies of that type would be able to pay any benefits to subscribers. Will the Minister discuss this matter with the South Australian Premier and ascertain whether it is possible for this Parliament, or the State Parliament, to enact legislation that will protect the people against the activities of such organizations, which can offer them little or no benefit. </para>

Unfortunately, because of the activities of the Opposition, that measure was lost with the result that we have not been able to bring about the reforms that the honorable member has in mind. I am prepared at all times to discuss this matter with the State Premiers with the object of arranging for the protection that this Parliament cannot give to the people. In the meantime, in order to prevent people from subscribing to companies which are not of the highest standard, I am arranging for the names of approved companies to be advertised frequently so that every Australian will be able to make sure that benefits will be available to him in time of sickness. </para>

                            <para>- In directing a question to the Minister for Health, I refer to the fact that a number, if not all, of the hospital insurance funds reserve the right to determine whether a person is suffering from a chronic illness and to accept no further financial responsibility for such persons. I have in mind two cases in which people had paid into a hospital fund for more than 20 years and were then told that they could not receive any benefit from the fund because their cases were chronic. In view of the fact that the Government's hospitals scheme must add to the income of such societies, has the Government brought any pressure to bear on them not to discriminate against chronic cases in relation to the payment of hospital fees from the funds? </para>

                                <para>- I am pleased to be able to say that some organizations which, during the period of what might be called the hospital insurance famine, of the Chifley Government, managed to remain in existence have proposed to me that they will pay benefits in all chronic cases. I have in mind especially some organizations such as those which apply to the Kurri Hospital and the "Wollongong Hospital Funds, which are situated in areas where there are miners' lodge organizations that deal with prepaid hospital insurance. Many other organizations, including major organizations, have decided to take a liberal view of what constitutes chronic disease, and have decided that if in any period, contributors have not been paid from the funds concerned, more than twice the total annual liability, the funds will not regard the particular disease as chronic. There are also other organizations which are willing to insure in regard to such diseases. Gradually the position is being corrected, and I think that, as the procedure extends throughout the whole community, the anomaly to which the honorable member has referred, will be capable of complete correction. </para>

                        <para>- It is not true to say that Australia is committed to take 40 per cent, of its requirements of tinplate from the United States of America. We have not placed any impediment in the way of British steel mills, which, apparently, have promoted comment of the kind that is implied in the question that the honorable member has asked, obtaining the whole of the Australian trade in tinplate. Before the war all of our requirements came from Great Britain, but during the war it was not possible for Great Britain to continue to supply our needs. Consequently, under an arrangement that we made with the British and American Governments we obtained all our supplies from the United States of America. Again, after the war, Great Britain could not supply all our requirements, and we again made arrangements to obtain a proportion of our needs from American steel mills. That arrangement was discussed with the British authorities, who acquiesced in it. If American mills were to supply us, naturally they desired some undertaking that they would have a market in this country for a foreseeable period. Therefore, an arrangement was made, first of all in 1947, whereby, on the condition that 40 per cent, of Australia's requirements could come from the United States of America, Australia undertook to make available import licences in respect of that percentage of our requirements as a maximum. That agreement which has been renewed from time to time, will continue to operate until the end of 1953, or 1954. But that does not mean that we are compelled to take 40 per cent, of our requirements from the United States of America. All that it means 13 that the Government will make import licences available in respect of that percentage of our requirements. It is still open to Australian buyers to obtain all their requirements from Great Britain, and it is also completely open to British mills to supply all our requirements if they can do so on a competitive basis. I have replied to the honorable  member's  question at length because the implication in his question conveyed a wrong impression about what Australia has done in this matter. Everything that we have done has been done after discussions with the British Government and with its acquiescence. </para>

                            <para>- For the time being there is no shortage of tinplate in Australia. How long the present circumstances will continue is another matter. Honorable members who have been in this House for some time will remember that in the past we have gone through stages of plentiful supply and great scarcity. As to stockpiling tinplate, I have recently had conversations with representatives .of the tinplate consuming industry, and have impressed on them the need for themselves acquiring and putting by as large quantities of tinplate as they can against the day when tinplate might again  be  scarce. Some consumers have complied with my request, and others have not received the suggestion with enthusiasm. That is perhaps because tinplate is an expensive article and perhaps because, unfortunately, they have found it more convenient to let the Government stockpile it for them. I am making every attempt to impress upon the industry the necessity to acquire larger stocks of tinplate, all the more so because it is freely available from Great Britain and it is very desirable that we should buy as much as we possibly can from Great Britain against the time when it may be again short in Australia. We shall then have a valid argument for obtaining further larger supplies from Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- It is true that a conference took place between the Premier of New South Wales, the Minister for National Development and myself in Sydney on, I think, last Friday. I cannot tell the honorable gentleman, at any rate at this stage, what was said at the conference, because it was a private conference. I can say that the conference was concerned with the prosperity of the coal-mining industry. I believe that it was a valuable conference. </para>

                            <para>- I ask the Prime Minister whether the Minister for National Development, accompanied by the Director of Mineral Resources, will, in the near future, meet representatives of the Pakistan Government in Pakistan to discuss the development of the Blair Athol coal-field. Is it the intention of the Minister to seek foreign capital for tills purpose; or is it likely that the Pakistan Government will be invited to work and develop these deposits by agreement with the Australian Government? Should the Pakistan Government be allowed to work the Blair Athol deposits, does the Government intend to allow it to do so by utilizing its own man-power and machinery? Is it a fact that the New South Wales Government has ample coal for sale and that recently 1,000,000 tons of coal was offered to the Pakistan Government on. the basis of immediate delivery? If so, does the right honorable gentleman consider that it is necessary to seek outside financial assistance to develop our coal resources when we have much machinery and equipment being offered for sale and when there is a surplus of man-power available to the industry? </para>

                            <para>- There never has been any suggestion, and I have a shrewd idea that the honorable member well knows it, that a coal-field in Australia should be worked by capital from Pakistan. Nobody has ever made any such proposal, and nobody in  Australia,  believes that such a proposal  has ever  been made. The position is that  a delegation  from Pakistan is coming  to Australia  to discuss the obtaining  of coal  from this country; and, of course,  it  would be a good thing for this country  if  we could develop an export market  in  coal. Therefore, we have said  that we  would be delighted to see such  a delegation.  I am afraid that the Minister for National Development will have  left Australia  before that delegation arrives  here.  He will be travelling via Pakistan  and  while he is in Karachi perhaps this  matter  will be mentioned to him; but  beyond  those simple facts I have nothing  to add  to what has already been said  on this  point. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister  for Air has  dealt very fully with the only  aspect of  the honorable member's question  that  concerns service establishments.  He has  made it quite clear that such retrenchments as have taken place in establishments under his administration  affected  people who were doing types  of work  different from those in which  Italian  workers were engaged temporarily.  The  honorable member has suggested  a  possible way in which Italian  labour  could be usefully employed, but  his suggestion  raises a very interesting question of Government policy upon which  it  would not be appropriate for  me to  express a view now. I can say, however, that the construction of a railway in  the area to which he has referred has already -received some attention by my colleagues. I shall bring to their notice the interesting and useful suggestion that he has :made. </para>

However, I am aware of the interest that the honorable member for Hunter and other honorable members have shown in his first question. As the honorable gentleman knows, we have given a good deal of attention to that matter. He will recall that he discussed with me a proposal whereby houses now occupied by those immigrants were offered to them on terms which, I understood the honorable gentleman himself to say, were reasonable in all the circumstances. It is a matter for some regret that such an offer has been rejected. A counter proposal has been made, I understand, that we should now examine the rents charged those persons for those places with a view to seeing whether some review can be made. I shall discuss that aspect with the Treasurer, who has a more direct interest in the financial implications than perhaps I have. </para>

                            <para>- Yesterday, I asked the Minister for Immigration a question about the immigration situation in Canada, and directed attention to the fact that the Canadian Government had practically closed the doors of that dominion to immigrants because it did not desire to add to the large number of unemployed, which is the result of its previous open-door immigration policy. The Minister, in his reply, said that he was surprised to hear of the position as I described it. Possibly the statement of the Minister may give rise to the suggestion that my information was not correct. I now ask the Minister whether he would support the view that the office of the Canadian Government Trade Commissioner in Sydney would be a reliable source of information on matters of Canadian Government policy, such as the subject under discussion? </para>

                                <para>- I have no reason to believe that the office of the Canadian Government Trade Commissioner in Sydney would not be an entirely authoritative source ; nor, for that matter, have I any reason to believe that the Minister for Immigration in Canada is not fully conversant with the policy of the Government of the dominion as it relates to his own department. My information on the matter comes directly from the Canadian Minister for Immigration. There may be some misunderstandings in this matter because of the seasonal employment of labour which occurs in Canada. As the honorable member for Mitchell may possibly be aware, when the winter season develops a good deal of unemployment of a seasonal character occurs in that dominion. According to my information, it has been the practice of the Canadian Government to slow down the intake of new settlers during that period when some local unemployment occurs, and to revive and resume the intake of new settlers at a normal level as the spring and summer seasons develop. That may, perhaps, have coloured the information which was passed on to the honorable member for Mitchell. However, I shall make a check with a view to seeing whether some more authoritative details can be given to him. I only add that Canada has undoubtedly pursued an energetic  immigration policy in the post-war years to its own great advantage, and whilst conditions are not entirely comparable in the two dominions, I believe that we ourselves can take encouragement from the success which has been achieved in Canada. </para>

It appears that the man to whom he has referred has had the misfortune to suffer from the dread disease of tuberculosis.

I do not propose, during the absence of my colleague for a brief period overseas, to take it upon myself to attend to matters which are within his peculiar province. In that sense, I do not regard it as being a part of my business to hold a sort of inquest into matters which are within his jurisdiction and under his administration.

                        <para>- This question should have been addressed to the Minister acting for the Minister for Civil Aviation, but I am in a position to reply to it, because I received a deputation, on his behalf, when I was in Newcastle some weeks ago. At that time, the Mayor of Newcastle merely asked whether we could try to define the area where the Newcastle airport was to be built, so that the Newcastle City Council could go to the trouble of filling in the area, if that is necessary, in order to make it level No provision has been made in the budget this year either for the construction of an airport or for the installation of any airport facilities at Hexham. I agree with the contention of the honorable member for Gwydir that it would be far better, in the immediate future, to expend whatever money is available on the construction of airports in outback western areas rather than to build airports in too close proximity to the cities. However, I shall refer the honorable gentleman's question to the Minister for Civil Aviation on his return to Australia, and supply the honorable member with an answer. </para>

                        <para>- I remind the Prime Minister of a deputation which he received  recently from councils in the metropolitan area of Melbourne on the subject of the provision of money by way of overdraft from the Commonwealth Bank and other financial institutions in order to finance private street construc tion. The right honorable gentleman stated in his reply that the central bank policy has not prevented local governing bodies from obtaining finance from banks for the purpose of constructing private streets. I mention, by way of explanation, that the Coburg City Council has been obtaining overdrafts from the Commonwealth Bank for many years. Last year it was refused financial accommodation of more than £100,000, and this year it has again been refused accommodation by way of overdraft. In view of the Prime Minister's reply to the deputation, can he suggest any action that the Coburg City Council can take in order to obtain money by way of overdraft from the Commonwealth Bank so as to provide the necessary funds for the construction of private streets in that city? </para>

That statement is true. Of course, I do not know about the negotiations between the Coburg City Council and the Commonwealth Bank. Naturally, those matters do not come within my immediate knowledge. But I shall ascertain what has happened in that case, and inform the honorable member of the position. </para>

I thought that he asked the amount of treasury-bills that were current, and not the amount of the increase. I had to answer his question from memory, and I said that it was unfair to expect me to be able to state the accurate amount. Since that time I have supplied the correct information to the Leader of the Opposition and, as a consequence of having given it to the Leader of the Opposition, the information is available to the honorable member for Melbourne. </para>

He has twice invited the attention of the relevant Cabinet committee to the matter. The position of the Commonwealth is that it has very willingly placed at the disposal of State and local authorities the knowledge gained by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization about this matter. It has also obtained supplies of a chemical known as chlordane, which is used for the purpose of eradicating the ant, and has indicated that it is willing to make that chemical available to the States or local authorities at the cost to the Commonwealth of obtaining the supplies.. Beyond that, the Commonwealth ia not prepared to accept responsibility for a matter which is not within the Commonwealth jurisdiction. </para>

Rather than criticize the efforts of private industry in this country, the honorable member and his colleagues should be extremely grateful for the enterprise and energy of private industry which is giving many useful employment opportunities at the present time to the Australian community. It will be a matter. of continuing policy on the part of the Government to establish factors that will be favorable for the healthy .expansion of primary and secondary industry ,as a whole and thus ensure adequate opportunities for the employment .of the Australian people. </para>

                        <para>. - This is a measure to give the force of law to certain regulations and orders, and for other purposes. Some analysis of it will be- of value to the House. Since 1945, a period of over seven years, the Parliament has passed, prior to the Christmas recess each year, a measure entitled the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Bill for the purpose of maintaining in legal effect a number of regulations and orders which derived their force, originally at any rate, from the defence power of the Commonwealth. The present Government parties, when they were in Opposition, argued that this procedure was wrong and that the regulations and orders should be converted into statutes legally supportable under some specific power of the Commonwealth, but they have not adopted that course since they have been in power. In 1950 and 1951, the Government continued in force the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act. This year, it proposes to take a somewhat different course, and, therefore, it is important that we should determine exactly what it intends to do by means' of this bill. The number of regulations required to be continued in force has diminished as the years have passed. However, I do not think that the title of the measure, which is the Defence Transition (Residual Provisions) Bill, is an accurate description of it. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Three groups of regulations will be kept in force by the bill. They are specified in Part I. and Part II. of the </para>
                    <para class="block">First Schedule and in the Second Schedule. The regulations listed in Part I. of the First Schedule are to continue in force for a further period of six months, and no longer. They are the National Security (Apple and Pear Acquisition) Regulations, the National Security (War Deaths) Regulations, and Regulation 66 of the National Security (General) Regulations. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McBride)</inline> has said - and I accept his statement implicitly - that these regulations are to be continued for the purpose of winding up certain matters. For instance, compensation may be payable to certain persons for the acquisition of apples or pears. Claims may not yet be finalized, although some years have elapsed since the acquisition scheme was terminated. In such circumstances, it is correct and proper that the regulations should be continued in force. Whether the desired result should be achieved by continuing the regulations or by passing an act is of little importance. We should be hypercritical, indeed, if we complained of the continuance of those regulations. The Parliament has passed measures that deal with the subjectmatters of the National Security (War Deaths) Regulations, and Regulation 66 of the general regulations, which refers to explosives. Those statutes will replace the regulations, and, no doubt, will come into force before the expiration of the period of six months. I turn my attention now to the Second Schedule and to Part II. of the First Schedule. </para>
                    <para>The Second Schedule specifies the Cordage and Fibre Order and the Jute Goods Order. In his second-reading speech, the Minister for Defence said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The two orders listed in the Second Schedule will be continued until the end of 1953, and will then lapse if not earlier revoked. They are the Cordage and Fibre Order and the Jute Goods Order. The transition from emergency conditions has not progressed as rapidly or as far, in respect of these matters, as it has in most other directions. I am advised that the continuance of these orders will command general consent in the industries to which they relate. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">These orders control the industries concerned. The view that the Opposition expressed on this subject last year is still tenable and correct. It is that, if the continuance of such control is warranted, it should be exercised by means of an act of Parliament and not by the mere continuance in force of regulations. Before I refer to the principle involved, I shall discuss the practical aspect. The regulations are difficult to discover. They are contained in a huge volume; but, even when the appropriate regulations have been found it is also found that they do not include the orders that have been made thereunder. The orders must be sought elsewhere. It is all right for the people in an industry to say that they want controls to be continued, but we must consider the people who are dealing with the industry from outside, and who find difficulty in ascertaining the law that is in operation with respect to the industry. Those regulations are to be continued for another twelve months. Therefore, the Minister was not accurate when he said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The bill disposes finally of the remnant of the national security miscellany. Honorable members, I arn sure, will attend its obsequies without lamentation. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">They are pretended obsequies. The fact is that the regulations will be continued in another form for at least another twelve months. That is not satisfactory. This Government has pledged itself to get rid of controls by regulation, but it is not doing so in this respect. </para>
                    <para>I have dealt with the regulations the continuance of which is clearly justifiable because they are necessary for the windingup of certain schemes, or are being replaced by statutes. They are contained in Part I. of the First Schedule. They are to be continued in operation for another six months. That is perfectly reasonable. The Cordage and Fibre Order and the Jute Goods Order, which are referred to in the Second Schedule, are to be continued for twelve months. They involve government control of industries more than seven years after the end of hostilities in the last war. The Opposition does not regard that as a proper approach to the matter. If control of an industry must be continued, it should be authorized by a statute. The Government knows that if this measure were called the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Bill, it would not be favoured. Therefore, the bill has been given a slightly different label. But the Cordage and Fibre Order and the Jute Goods Order are to be continued in operation. If the Government considers it necessary for the orders to be continued, they should be put into statute form. </para>
                    <para>I turn to the third group of regulations, which is contained in Part II. of the First Schedule. The group consists of five sets of regulations. They are even more important than those that I have already mentioned. The Minister, referring to them in his second-reading speech, said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Broadly, the position with these is that they do not draw their support from the defence powers, and that they are  not  now needed except for winding up or for transitional purposes. However, it is not quite clear how soon they can be replaced or dispensed with. In these cases, therefore, no time limit is fixed. Indeed, no time limit is necessary because their continuance does not depend upon an emergency or on  emergency  powers. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The Minister illustrated that point by referring to regulations dealing with the occupation of property. He said that, in his view - -and I do not disagree with him - they were necessary for winding up purposes and for assessing compensation for the occupation of properties. Another of the regulations deals with the finalization of certain proceedings by the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. If certain regulations are necessary for winding up purposes, the Parliament could not do other than agree to them being continued in operation. I turn now to a regulation which is very important, as honorable members will see at a glance. The Minister said - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The Shipping Co-ordination Regulations are set out at page 342 of the <inline font-style="italic">Manual of Defence Transitional Legislation,</inline> which was published by the Chifley Government, of which I was a member, as long ago as 194S. Those regulations, which are to be continued in operation, contain no fewer than 49 clauses. They give the Government tremendous power over shipping and, thereby, over the commerce of Australia. They are very important. </para>
                    <para class="block">The view of the Government is that they can be maintained in operation legally, not under the defence power but under the Commonwealth's undoubted power in respect of overseas and interstate trade. If that be so, surely they should have been embodied in permanent legislation long ago. I should say that not one honorable member could sum up the effect of the Shipping Co-ordination Regulations, which, by this measure, will be continued in force indefinitely. I do not pretend to know all the details of the regulations myself, although I have looked them up for the purposes of this debate. They are very elaborate and very important. Therefore, they should be granted the honour of being included in the statute-book, but that is not to be done. </para>
                    <para>The industrial property group of regulations is set out at page 151 of the <inline font-style="italic">Manual of Defence Transitional Legislation,</inline> without which, during the last war, it was impossible to know what the law of the country was. The Industrial Property Regulations deal with two vital subjects - inventions and designs covered by patent legislation and jurisprudence, and trade marks. The regulations contain very important provisions. The Government has said that they have no relation to defence as such, although they had their origin in the defence power. They are to be continued in operation because in the view of the Government they are necessary. The Minister said in his second-reading speech - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The Industrial Property Regulations are being incorporated progressively into the revised patent, trade mark and designs legislation which is being prepared, and of which the first act has already been passed. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Let me sum the matter up. There can be no objection to the continuance of the regulations referred to in Part I. of the First Schedule, because they are necessary for winding up purposes and for the assessment of compensation. They relate to matters such as war debts, in respect, of which permanent legislation has been passed. The Cordage and Fibre Order and the Jute Goods Order are to be continued for at least twelve months, and may be continued thereafter. I do not express an opinion whether such regulations are justified, because I am not  sufficiently conversant with the trades concerned. I have no doubt that persons in these trades support the continuance of the regulations because they enable them to exercise a substantial monopoly in these trades. That often happened during the last war, when such action was essential. The fact that people in a trade support the continuance of a regulation is not sufficient reason for its continuance. We must consider the interests of people outside the trade. The Third group of regulations is based, not upon the defence power, but upon the powers of the Commonwealth in relation to patents, trade marks, interstate trade and other matters. Because they are not based upon the defence power, they are to be continued indefinitely. I say that they should be continued, not as regulations, but as acts of Parliament. </para>
                    <para>The Minister overstated the Government's case when he said that the bill would dispose finally of the remnants of the national security miscellany. It will not do  30.  Controls which are supportable under powers other than the defence power of the Commonwealth should, if they are required to be continued, be embodied in ordinary acts of the Parliament, which honorable members could consider in detail. Who knows what is in the Shipping Co-ordination Regulations? They authorize the Commonwealth to exercise great powers. I do not believe that similar powers are exercised in Britain or any other part of the British Commonwealth. I do not believe that the Government has made out its case. We do not want to be hypercritical about these matters but we cannot forget that after 1945 the Chifley Government, year by year, got rid of many of these regulations. This Government came into office on a pledge to get rid of such controls altogether. In 1950 it made no move to get rid of them. In 1951, it was subjected to a merciless and devastating bombardment by the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> and everything was to be in apple-pie order for this session. No more regulations having their basis in wartime powers were to be made. Everything was to be forthwith repealed or put in permanent legislation which the Par- liament would be able to discuss clause by clause. That has not been done, but I have no doubt that before the debate is over the honorable member for Melbourne will have something to say about whether the Government has kept the undertakings that it gave previously to this House. </para>

                        <para>.- Nobody can deny that in the general election campaigns of 1949 and 1951 this Government proclaimed itself as the champion of free enterprise. It went on record solemnly as opposed to all controls. Nobody can deny that the Government, and the members of the parties which support it, said that the Labour party believed in controls for the sake of controls, and that if we did not get rid of all controls exercised by virtue of regulations made under the National Security Act, and every other form of control, this country would be socialized within the lifetime of the , Nineteenth Parliament. Of course, having won the 1949 general election, the Government proceeded to contradict itself. It proceeded to give an exhibition of a lack of consistency that must be without parallel anywhere. Instead of repealing the regulations made under the National Security Act, which had been continued by the Chifley Government under the title of the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act, it re-enacted that legislation in 1950 and again in 1951. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dedman</inline> brought down the 1949 version of the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act in this House, he said that the measure would not be re-enacted in 1950. Had we remained in office we should have honoured that promise. We were amazed to discover in 1950 that this Government had set out actually to continue the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act of 1946. Not only did it continue that act for one year from 1950 to 1951, but it also re-enacted it last year. This year, it attempts to fool the people by calling its bill the Defence Transition (Residual Provisions) Bill and blandly says, "We have come to the end of the road. The Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act is now on the way out. We shall make no more regulations under it". But it introduces the Defence Transitional (Residual Provisions) Bill, which starts  the whole process over again. Next year, the Government can bring down another version of this legislation and extend the controls. </para>

                            <para>- They may have expired, but some of them, as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has pointed out, may not expire. The Shipping Co-ordination Regulations. for instance, would expire if the Government sold the Commonwealth line of steamers. I suppose it is waiting to get rid of the line before it decides what it will do about these regulations. If that is not the position, the Government should explain why it is continuing the regulations indefinitely. The regulation listed in the First Schedule to the bill is to be continued until midnight on the 30th June, 1953, whilst the orders specified in the Second Schedule are to be continued until the 31st December, 1953. A government can be judged only on its record, and this Government must be judged on the inconsistency it has shown over the last few years in relation to regulations. If, unfortunately, the Government is still in office at this time next year I have not the slightest doubt that it will bring down another bill of this sort to continue, for instance, the Cordage and Fibre Order and the Jute Goods Order listed in the Second Schedule. It is interesting to observe how easily Ministers can delude themselves. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McBride)</inline> said in his second-reading speech that we had seen the last of these regulations because of the introduction of the new bill which is to keep on foot, for varying periods, the small residual groups of regulations and orders listed in the schedules. The members of the present Government who sat in the Eighteenth Parliament used to attack us because we were continuing in 1947, 1948 and 1949 the regulations made under the National Security Act. As a matter of fact in 1947 they blitzed us properly because, two years after the end of the war, they said we were governing the country by regulation. The present Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eric J. Harrison),</inline> as the  Deputy  Leader of the Liberal party, had this to say during the debate on the 1947 Defence (Transitional Provisions) Bill - </para>

                            <para>- I think that the honorable member gets as far away from the Government as he can on some occasions, but he is still behind it. Perhaps, in some respects, he can be in front of it, because that would not be difficult. The Government would be behind some of the views that he expressed in other days. He, like other honorable members opposite, who denounced the use of the regulation making power in the past, offers no criticisms of this bill. Last year, Ministers were really upset that any body should criticize the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Bill 1951. They expected that honorable members on both sides of the chamber would support that legislation. They said, in effect, " It is difficult to translate some of these regulations into legislation, so let us have this brand of legislation for another year ". They did not make much of a defence of their position. They called in the honorable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne),</inline> the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> and the honorable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth)</inline> to defend the regulation-making power, and those honorable gentlemen performed their allotted task, either by speech or interjection. I do not see the honorable member for Mackellar at the moment, but I have no doubt that if he were in the chamber, he would defend the introduction of this bill. The Prime Minister has done one service to this Parliament. He has put the honorable member for Mackellar against a wall, but he has not yet eliminated him completely. </para>

                    <para>All the other honorable members, who defended this Government last year, now realize that the country will not accept explanations or excuses put forward by Ministers for the introduction of this measure in the light of all they said about the evil of controls and government by regulation, and the necessity to make the Parliament the real authority in the life of the country. We are told that only a few regulations remain. The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out that one of them covers a vast number of matters. The Minister for Defence has tried unsuccessfully to mislead the Parliament. He should have been honest, and should not have stated that we are seeing the last of the regulations. We are not seeing the last of them. We shall see more of them next year, if this Government is still in office. The Minister has spoken about the obsequies of the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act, and has invited us to participate in the function with lamentations. It appears to me that the Government has performed a resurrection. The Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act 1946 is being interred, and the Defence Transition (Residual Provisions) Act of 1952 is being born. I suppose we are expected to be glad that the act of 1946 is dead, and to have no feelings at all because the act of 1952 is being born. </para>
                    <para>The Opposition does not accept the assurance of the Government that this legislation will not be continued in 1953. In the dying hours of next year, we shall be asked to re-enact this particular legislation or a variant of it. I add again the rider, " if the Government is still in office". I am amused at one interesting feature of this legislation. Clause 7 has that side note, " Savings ". I suppose it means a qualification, and is intended to preserve the legality of some of the provisions of the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act 1946, which is to be interred. However, clause 7 deals with regulations, instruments and documents, and authorities constituted or holding office, or a person employed, immediately before the commencement of this act, in relation, to future happenings. The Leader of the Opposition has spoken the mind of the Australian people about legislation of this sort. </para>
                    <para>In my opinion, the Government should be ashamed of its failure to carry out its pre-election promise, and the policy of the Liberal party itself with respect to these matters. The Labour party is always consistent. It knows where it is going. It does not deviate or wander very far, one way or another, from the road to its objective, which lies ahead. But this Government is zigzagging all over the place. It does not seem to know what will happen next year on matters of this sort. I consider that the Government should express regret that it misled the people in 1949, and again in 1951, regarding this legislation. It should offer apologies for its action, and promise that, when it is returned to political oblivion, it will mend its ways, so that it may give a little better performance, should it ever regain office. We shall be sorry to see honorable members opposite go personally, but we shall attend the obsequies of this Government without lamentation. </para>

                    <para class="block">Government is opposed to government by regulation, and has endeavoured, as far as possible, to repeal regulations or place them in legislative form. It is a fact that whatever we expected in 1949 to do under the conditions that existed then, it has not been possible to give effect to our. plans for two reasons. The first is that conditions have substantially changed since 1949. When we came into office, we had no Korea on our hands, and the world position looked much calmer than it appears at the present time. Because of that fact, it has been necessary to continue some regulations which otherwise would have passed into the discard. Secondly, I make no apology for the  fact that there is a physical limit to what the Government can do in dealing with matters of this kind. I remind the honorable member for Melbourne that, during this long session, the Parliament has passed a record number of bills. </para>

                            <para>- Every bill receives a great deal of consideration by the department which initiates it, and by the Government, and involves the Parliamentary Draftsman in a great deal of work before it is presented to, and discussed by, the Parliament. The record of this Parliament during the present session must be the envy of the members of the Labour Government in which the honorable member for Melbourne was a Minister. Some regulations are being continued for varying periods, but I assure the Parliament and the people that, at the earliest possible moment, the regulations will be discarded completely, or put into legislative form . It is particularly gratifying to honorable members on this side of the chamber to learn of the opposition of the Labour party to the system of government by regulation. The Chifley Labour Government imposed more regulations and orders on the people than had ever existed in our history. Those regulations and orders were promulgated under legislation passed by the Menzies Government at the beginning of World War II. </para>

                        <para>.- I understand that during the second-reading debate, the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> was kind enough to draw some inference from the fact that I supported the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Bill introduced' by the Government last year, but was absent from the chamber when the debate was resumed on the Defence Transition (Residual Provisions) Bill 1952 this afternoon. Let me disabuse the honorable gentleman's mind of any sinister conclusions that he may have drawn from my temporary absence from the chamber. I fully support the Government's action in introducing this bill. The conclusion to be drawn from the time it is taking the present Government to Tepeal regulations promulgated in war-time is obvious to me. The Labour party, contrary to the protestations of honorable members opposite in this debate, saw fit to govern by regulation so completely that it has taken the present Government, which is determined to get rid of all Ihese regulations as quickly as possible, more than two and a half years to reach the present stage, and provide a way out of the morass. Therefore, in this matter T. support the Government. </para>

I presume that he' was not, because if he had been he would have understood that the criticism offered by the Opposi tion was not as he suggests. We consider that this measure will not mean the end of government by regulation. On the contrary, in respect of shipping coordination, where control of the shipping industry is still continued by regulation, and in relation to patents and copyrights and so forth, the method of continuing control is by way of regulation. The Opposition strongly supports the view that legislation should be substituted for these regulations if legislation is deemed necessary. Therefore, the honorable member for Evans has misconceived our criticism, and should have been here to listen to it. </para>

                        <para>. - Undoubtedly the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board is performing important functions. <inline font-style="italic">One</inline> of those is the payment of what is called attendance, or appearance, money to waterfront employees. Other matters of greater value to the waterfront industry are also dealt with by the board. The Government is Continuing the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board, and I think that in doing so it is taking the correct action. It was the Opposition's original proposal that the functions of the board should be properly a charge on the industry, and that the industry should make up any reasonable deficiency in respect of payments made on its behalf by the board. The increase of appearance money now contemplated is startling, and the case made out earlier by the Government for this increase is .completely unconvincing. In 1947 the Chifley Government introduced legislation to impose a charge of 4-kl. a man-hour of employment. In October, 1949, the Chifley Government reduced the charge to 2-J-d. a man-hour of employment. It is obvious that all charges such as this are ultimately borne by the consumers, because they are passed on through the various stages of the industry until they reach the consumers. In the wonderful month of November, 1949,* the Government parties made the assertion that the cost of living would be reduced and value would be put back into the fi if they were elected to office. In December, 1951, the Government, after two years in office, increased the charge from 2-Jd. to 4d. a man-hour. Now this motion proposes to increase it to lid. a man-hour of employment. That is a startling increase of 7d. a man-hour and represents an increase of almost 200 per cent. There is no doubt, in the view of the Opposition, that the increase has been largely caused by the collapse of the Government's policy to slow down inflation in this country. This could not be a better illustration of uncontrolled inflation. The Government has allowed the position to get completely out of hand and, indeed, it has run down our overseas funds. This Government got a windfall last year because of the wonderful price of our wool, but it has sadly depleted the overseas savings built up by the previous Labour Government. Of course, the import restrictions and other Government actions have all played their part. </para>

                    <para>The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> has stated that recently there has been a decline in inward cargoes. That is due to the Government's import restriction policy. We all know that n certain situation had to be met, hut, uo doubt, the import restriction policy is one cause of the present position. The Minister has stated that that has resulted in less congestion on thu wharfs, and that for the first time in years there has been an ample supply of labour in most major ports. The import restriction policy has meant less congestion in an industry which has not kept up with modern wharf conditions in other parts of the world, as has been demonstrated by the Basten report. The Minister said that " the consequence has been a much quicker turn-round of ships. This is to the- great . benefit of the economy generally ". However, this Government has in the past attributed the slow turn round of ships solely to the method of working of the waterfront employees. Now it is quite apparent that the slow turn-round was not entirely due to the method of working of these employees. Members of the Opposition have al way i maintained that the situation was dun to wharf congestion, insufficient berthing accommodation and a general failure to make provision for Australia's rapidly expanding commerce. We have pointed out on previous occasions that no additional wharfage in longitudinal measure has been provided in Australian ports during the last 35 years. We have suffered its a result of the failure to modernize equipment for the handling of overseas commerce. All governments during the last 40 years must accept their share of blame for that failure. Now, because of the peculiar situation that has arisen following import restrictions, the truth is being revealed to the public. </para>

                        <para>. - Although you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> in accordance with accepted .procedure and practice, have ruled that the amendment that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has submitted is out of order, the right honorable gentleman need not remain under any sense of grievance because it should not be difficult to supply him with the explanation that he has requested if, indeed, that was his purpose in submitting his amendment. I rather suspect, however, that his objective is not to obtain information, but to make  party political capital out of this measure. If he desires the information that he has indicated, I shall gladly supply it to him,  because it can be stated simply. It is true that the proposed increase of the charge appears to be substantial and to call for some explanation, but I have not heard the right honorable gentleman challenge any part of the foundation on which the charge itself is based. He acknowledges the desirability of continuing the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board and the various functions that it carries out. He acknowledges the desirability of having a system of attendance money payments. Indeed, it would be remarkable if he did not make that acknowledgment -seeing that the Government which he supported introduced that system some years ago. If we start from that point, the question before the House must be whether, if the board is to operate and if one of its functions is to fee the payment of attendance money, the charge proposed to be levied under this measure will be adequate, or excessive, for the purposes for which it is made. I propose to examine the matter on that basis. </para>

                    <para>Earlier I pointed out that three factors principally make it necessary to increase the charge on the scale now proposed. The first of them is that there has been a considerable increase in the incidence of attendance money payments. It is true that some years ago we were able to reduce the charge from 44d. to 2£d. a manhourfor the simple reason that at that time there was an acute shortage of labour on the waterfront. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. During that period and, indeed, for a considerable period afterwards, there was a shortage of labour on the waterfront and that shortage was one of the factors that contributed to the slow turn-round of shipping and to the increase of freight charges. But in more recent times, because of the application of import restrictions, there has been less movement of shipping to Australia and, as a consequence, attendance money payments have been much greater. </para>

                            <para>- I shall go into that aspect later. In passing, I might say that until recent times it has been a chronic complaint of the shipowners that the labour force available to them has been inadequate to meet their needs. The attendance money payment has become such a heavy charge only since shipping has declined, partly as a result of import restrictions and partly because of the normal slack in the winter months. The second factor is that the court itself awarded an increase of the attendance money payment from 12s. to 16s. a day. Had there been a normal volume of employment and had the labour force been maintained at its previous strength, it would still have remained necessary to make a substantial increase of the charge although not on the scale that is proposed under this measure. The third factor is that the incidence of attendance money payments has been so high that the funds available to the Stevedoring Industry Board have been inadequate to enable it to meet its commitments under this heading and, consequently, its overdraft has increased considerably. Those are the three factors that have contributed principally to the necessity to introduce this proposal. Those who are responsible for the financial aspects of this matter have made the appropriate calculations and have come to the conclusion that a charge of lid. per man hour is required. Previously, I gave the assurance that as soon as these arrears have been overtaken the rate of the charge will be reviewed. I do not wish to add anything more on that aspect of the matter. </para>

                    <para>I cannot allow to pass without brief comment some extraordinary statements that were made by the Leader of the Opposition. He talked about this increase being due to some collapse and as being evidence of the Government's failure to put value back into the £1. "Whilst 1 might expect criticism from many quarters regarding the abnormal increase of freight charges that have occurred on the Australian coast in recent years, I certainly did not expect to hear such criticism voiced by honorable members opposite because I recall that during the long term for which the Government that they supported was in office, not only did the rate of handling of cargoes decreaseto an unprecedented degree, but freight charges between Australian ports also shot up at an alarming rate. Undoubtedly, those factors tended to increase prices. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and it did so for the reason that I have given. At that time, the labour force on the wharfs was inadequate, having regard to the volume of cargoes that had to be handled. As a consequence, the slow turn-round of shipping worsened, cargo charges were increased and the general cost of living rose sharply. The Government has been making its best endeavour to deal effectively with this problem. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with him that the results are far from satisfactory, and I say so without satisfaction. I should have welcomed some evidence from the Opposition that it had tried to impress upon those who work on the waterfront and on our ships the fact that, by giving a far better performance than they have given in recent years, they can make a substantial contribution towards the reduction of living costs. But what evidence is there that the Labour party has done anything to foster an improved performance on the waterfront? I am glad to say that, in recent months, there has been a substantial improvement. It has not been by any means so great as we wish, but at least there has been a movement in the right direction. The turn-round of ships has. been accelerated, and some shipowners are now able to advertise regular schedules for the first time in years. The right honorable gentleman has had to strain the facts and his sense of logie in order to develop some political propaganda from this measure for his party. I shall not try to follow him along that course, because other honorable gentlemen wish to debate this measure in the limited time that is available to us. </para>

                            <para>- It is extraordinarily high, and the Government has made an inquiry. I have informed the House of the facts that were disclosed by tha t inquiry, which suggest that the rate of Hd. should apply at least temporarily until the arrears have been overtaken. Whether this will give any satisfaction to honorable members I do not know, but it is a fact that, far from causing an increase of freight rates, the action taken by the Government in recent months has had the effect of bringing freight rates down. Overseas shipping rates have already been reduced, and there are indications that coastal freight rates will be reduced. When we discussed this matter at the committee stage, I was able to supply to honorable members details which showed the minute effect that the increased charge would have upon freight charges. We are far more likely to induce substantial reductions of freight rates as a result of the improved work performance, the greater rapidity of the turn-round of ships and the institution of regular shipping schedules, than to cause freight increases as a result of the higher charge for which the bill provides. The House can support the measure in the knowledge that, when the arrears are overtaken, the Government will introduce amending legislation to reduce the rate of charge in order to meet the needs that will then be apparent. </para>

                        <para>. - The waterside workers will he able to say, when this bill becomes law, that the Government's chickens have come home to roost. The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> has endeavoured to convince the House that the proposed increase from 4d. to lid. an hour has been made necessary by the reduction of shipping traffic and the standing off of large numbers of men on the waterfront. The Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> reported this morning that 1,200 men were idle at Port Adelaide yesterday. That was the largest number for about ten years. When the shipowners and the Government originally campaigned for an increase of the number of waterside workers, the men feared that an undue increase would give rise to the conditions that now prevail. The proposed increase of the charge from 4d. to lid. an hour is considerable, but I am not greatly concerned about that. I am gravely concerned about the cause of the increase, which is to be found in the large number of .men who will be stood off regularly at 16s. a day. The law provides that these men must not take other work if they are to qualify for attendance money. They must be available for work on the waterfront every day. The number of waterside workers at Port Adelaide was greatly increased less than two years ago notwithstanding the protests of the secretary of the local branch of the Waterside Workers Federation, whom no intelligent person will accuse of being a Communist or an industrial  disruptionist  The Minister has attributed the present situation largely to the effect of import restrictions. The Government's import policy is less to blame than was its earlier action in throwing the door wide open to the importation of goods of all kinds. The import trade expanded to such a degree that ships were frequently obliged to anchor outside our harbours, not because of an insufficiency of labour on the waterfront, but because there was no wharf accommodation for them. The Government wrongly blamed the waterside workers for the slow turn-round of ships during that period. The truth is that the delay was principally due to the tremendous influx of goods from overseas. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Anybody who has been associated with shipping for a considerable length of time will be aware that the slow turn-round of ships was due to a sudden revival of the import trade after a slack period. A similar situation developed two or three years after World War I. Plenty of money was available for imports, and the result was that so many ships arrived at Australian ports that adequate wharf accommodation could not be provided for them. There was no suggestion then of a shortage of  man-power  Plenty of men were available, and the simple fact is that the slow turn-round of ships during that period was entirely  due  to the inadequacy of port facilities. The same situation arose about eighteen months ago, when a great cry went up for an increase of the number of workers on the waterfront. We have the increased numbers now, and the workers can justifiably say to the Government, " Your chickens are coming home to roost ". There are more waterside workers in Australia to-day than can be fully employed under- normal conditions. . Therefore, the total cost of paying attendance money to men who are stood off has increased considerably. The workers consider that the attendance fee of 16s. a day is inadequate. I agree with them. If 12s. was adequate when wages amounted to only 50 per cent, of current rates, 16s. obviously is not adequate now. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has reasonably asked for an inquiry into the amount of the proposed increase and also into the general employment situation on the waterfront in order to determine whether or not the number of waterside workers is excessive. About a week ago, there was a complaint that the men at Port Adelaide would not work overtime. Yet, when it suited the shipping companies to do so, they refused to engage men for overtime work so that they would not be required to pay more than the ordinary daily rate. The attitude adopted by the men to-day is the natural result of their treatment in the past. Nobody can say truthfully that our ships are delayed because of any lack of cargo. Harvests must be shifted, and there is a constant flow of goods between States. Large consignments are transported regularly by road. Therefore, there must be plenty of cargo available for ships. The situation has returned to normal, but we have an abnormally large number of men available for employment on the waterfront. That is the cause of the present trouble. I cannot sincerely oppose the bill, because the men must receive their attendance fee of 16s. a day when work is not available for them. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have ruled that the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition is out of order. The Minister for Labour  and National Service indicated, in any case, that the Government would reject it. Therefore, there can be no doubt that it would have been defeated. However, I hope that the Government will give further consideration to the conditions that apply on the waterfront to-day and reach the conclusion that there are too many men in the industry. </para>

                        <para>.- It is an unusual circumstance for any honorable member on this side of the House to criticize the remarks of the honorable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson),</inline> for whom I have considerable respect. However, this afternoon we have . had the misfortune to listen to a most irresponsible speech by the honorable member. The whole tenor of his remarks was intended to suggest to the House, and to the country at large, that there were too many men employed on the waterfront, and, presumably, that some of them should be taken off. The effect of his remarks throughout the country will be to encourage the militant Waterside Workers Federation, under the control of the Communist, Healy, to deny the entry of further men to waterfront employment. The fact is that waterfront employment is, of its very nature, seasonal. The volume of trade is subject to seasonal variations and to fluctuations in the volume of imports from time to time. These and other considerations cause the demand for labour on the waterfront to vary considerably. At the present time, owing to the very severe restriction of imports into Australia and the fact that, " consquently, many ships arrive here with their holds either empty or only partly filled, it is very easy to clear overseas ships. Therefore, for the time being, in what we hope and expect is only a temporary state of affairs, more labour is available on the waterfront than has been available for some time. But that does not mean that the surplus of laborer will be permanent, or that it is unnecessary. We most confidently expect that the volume of imports from overseas will increase in the near future. Therefore, there is a danger that we shall see again the chronic shortage of labour on the waterfront which delayed the turn-round of ships in our ports for so long, at such great cost to the community. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The honorable member for Port Adelaide said that there were more men available yesterday in the port of Adelaide than had been available there for eight or ten years. I ask the House to consider for a moment the state of affairs that existed on the waterfront during the last eight or ten years. In 1942, ten years ago, activity in Australian ports was almost at a record level, due to the movement of war <inline font-style="italic">materiel.</inline> That state of affairs continued throughout the wal'. The state of affairs on the waterfront after the war is so notorious that there is no need for me to remind the House of it. If more labour was available on the- waterfront in Port Adelaide yesterday than had been available for eight or ten years, that means that the chronic shortage of labour on the waterfront from which the country has suffered so grievously during the last ten years has been relieved to some extent. It is a cause for satisfaction rather than concern. Some members of the Opposition may say that I am advocating a continued surplus of labour on the waterfront, but I am doing nothing of the sort. The House knows that waterfront work is of a fluctuating nature. For waterside workers, there are periods of almost continuous overtime, high ra,tes of pay, and high weekly earnings. They are counterbalanced at other times by shortages of work and diminished earnings. That is of the very nature of waterside work. Men who work on the waterfront for year after year are aware of that . fact, and generally are prepared to accept it. Permanent work with almost continuous overtime could be given to waterfront workers only by holding up ships in our ports and making the availability of labour the only test of how fast ships could he turned round. The experience of the post-war years has shown that such conditions can be maintained only at a great cost to the community. </para>
                    <para>I conclude with a warning to the Rouse. The present improvement of the rate at which ships are cleared in Australian ports may prove to be quite temporary.. It is due to two factors: first, that fewer ships are coming to this country, due to import restrictions, and that frequently some of these ships are only partly filled or are in ballast; ' and secondly, that labour is available in more reasonable quantities than previously. If the flow of imports into this country were to return, not to the abnormal level of a year ago but to a normal level, the first of the two factors to which I have referred would operate no longer, and ships would again be held up. It is quite possible that the flow of imports will soon return to normal. The reasons for the slow turn-round of ships in Australian ports are complex and varied. A number of factors are involved, including a shortage of labour; reduced output per man-hour compared with pre-war years; congestion of wharfs; lack of proper wharf facilities; lack of warehouses behind wharfs; old wharfs which are too small; warehouses which are out of date ; lack of modern handling equipment on wharfs; congested roads behind wharfs in some ports - especially Sydney - and the introduction of the 40- hour week into the warehouse trade and carrier trade. Availability of labour is only one of the factors involved. It is only reasonable to expect that, when the flow of imports to Australia returns to normal, ships will again be delayed. I am very chary about finding any comfort in the present increased rate of handling ships in our ports because, for the reasons I have given, I think that the increase is likely to be only temporary. </para>
                    <para>I remind the House that many aspects of the problem are entirely in the hands of State governments and State instrumentalities. I direct attention particularly to the state of affairs in the port of Sydney. That port, which once was one of the best ports in the world, with natural facilities greater than those of almost any other port, is now antiquated, out of date and totally inefficient. Very little, if anything, is being done to improve it. It is notorious that the very considerable revenue derived from the port of Sydney is consistently milked by the New South Wales Government for general revenue and is not used to  improve the port. It is time that the people of New South Wales and of Australia as a whole realized what the Labour Government of New South Wales is doing to the port of Sydney by taking its revenue and not attempting to improve the facilities of the port. I am afraid that no comfort can be derived from the fact that " Sailor Jim" McGirr - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGirr,</inline> the former Premier of New South Wales - is now, with his long and well-known absence of any experience of marine affairs, in charge of the Maritime Services. Board of New South Wales. A situation that was bad before, will, certainly become worse in the future.. The most improper and unreasonable appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGirr</inline> to the Maritime Services Board by the New South Wales Government is another indication of the contempt with which that Govern.ment treats the port of Sydney. </para>
                    <para>I turn to the increase of charges proposed in the bill. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> gave that matter some passing attention. We are aware that the duties of a Leader of the Opposition are many and varied, but this afternoon we witnessed the spectacle of the right honorable gentleman searching . for any argument that, with a semblance of reason, he could use as a stick with which to beat the Government. He reached the height of ridiculousness when he suggested that this increase is necessary because of the Government's failure to keep down living costs in Australia. It has nothing to do with living costs. It has nothing to do with the Government's activities in any way. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed."]</inline> Before I return to the bill, I direct the attention of the House to the settled practice of the Opposition in arranging for a quorum to be called by the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> and for the Opposition Whip to direct members of the Opposition to remain out of the chamber. Honorable gentlemen on this side of the House saw him doing that at the door of the chamber just now. When a quorum was called, only six members of the Labour party were present, but the Opposition Whip followed his usual practice of directing members of his party to stay outside the chamber. </para>
                    <para>There are three reasons for the increase of the charge per man-hour for the payment of attendance money on the waterfront. First, there is now more labour available. </para>

                            <para>- It means that the chronic shortage of labour that existed previously has been relieved to some extent. It does not mean that there is unemployment on the waterfront, as the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> has suggested. Perhaps he would not have made that remark if he had had the advantage of hearing what I said to the House a little while ago. T hope that he will read those remarks in due course. I shall not take up the time of the House by repeating them. The first reason for the increase of the charge is that the chronic shortage of labour that existed on the waterfront for the last ten years has been relieved to some extent, although not entirely. The second reason is that there was a considerable overdraft in the fund from which attendance money is paid. The third reason i,that there has been a temporary reduction of the demand for waterfront labour, due to a falling off of imports as a result o.r import restrictions. Those factors, together with the increase of the attendance money from 12s. to 16s. a day, have made a substantial increase of the charge necessary. Under this bill, it will be increased from 4d. to Hd. It is reasonable to expect that a fairly considerable portion of the Hd. will be used to wipe out the existing overdraft in the fund from which payments of attendance money are made. I hope that the Government will be able to review the charge when the overdraft has been wiped out, and reduce it to the level necessary to enable curren attendance money to be paid at the present rate of 16s. a day. I support the bill. I hope that the charge imposed will hp reviewed in the near future. </para>

                        <para>. - This bill, like so much of the legislation that the Parliament has considered during the last week or two, has been presented in great haste, and the Opposition has not been given sufficient information to enable it to judge the merits or demerits of the measure. We feel that the Government has not disclosed facts that would justify an increase of <inline font-style="italic">tha</inline> charge from 4d. to Hd. The honorable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne)</inline> has implied that all of the money that is paid to the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board is used to pay attendance money. That is not true, as an examination of the last accounts available to the House, those for the year ended the 30th June. 1951, will show. I draw the honorable member's attention to the balance-sheet and the statement of income and expenditure at page 51 of the board's report, which show that out of a total expenditure by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board of £529,000 in the year ended the 30th June, 1951, only £260,000 was in fact paid as attendance money. The remainder of the expenditure was consumed in administrative expenses of one kind or another. It is interesting to note that in that year the hourly rate was only 2-£d., so that approximately l-Jd. of the 2^-d. hourly rate was used for the payment of attendance money. It is not true to say that the amount that will be derived from the proposed increase of the rate to Hd. will all go towards providing attendance money. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Opposition seeks a fuller explanation of the measure than the Government has given. The Government should explain why the hourly rate must be increased from 4d. to Hd. It is true that the attendance money rate has increased from 12s. to 16s. a day, but that increase by no means offsets for the waterside workers the increase of the cost of living that has occurred under this Government. It is true, as the Government has suggested, that more attendance money is payable, but that fact is only an indication that unemployment, or partial unemployment, on the waterfront is more serious than the Government will admit. Such unemployment, whether it be full or partial unemployment, means a reduced weekly wage for the people concerned", because even were a. waterside worker to receive 16s. a day for five or six days a week he would still be receiving only an inadequate dole. The board directed attention to the fact that there was a shortage of labour on the waterfront in June, 1951. Between that time and October, 1952, a surplus of waterfront labour has come into existence. That is simply an indication of the failure of the Government's catastrophic economic policies, which have produced a shortage of work. This matter simply exemplifies in microcosm, as it were, the whole policy of the Government, and indicates that if economic conditions deteriorate in one direction the impact is felt throughout the whole community. The fact that the amount of attendance money payable has increased shows merely that the amount of unemployment, or partial unemployment, has increased. </para>
                    <para>The Opposition considers that the Government has not divulged the full facts on this matter. We want the Government to reveal how much of this hourly charge of lid. is to go towards the payment of attendance money. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member for Canning <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hamilton)</inline> will examine last year's accounts of the board he will find that about 50 per cent, of the money paid to the board was not used to pay attendance money, but was used to meet the board's administrative costs. At that stage the hourly charge was only 2-id. It is now to be increased to lid. What wre want to know is whether the whole of the increase will go towards the payment of attendance money or whether it will be frittered away in meeting the administrative costs of the board. That is why the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> moved the amendment that the bill be deferred for the time being and thai more adequate information about it be presented to the Parliament. At least the Government ought to have made available to us a full statement of income and expenditure of the board for the year ended the 30th June last. Such information could have been incorporated in the Minister's speech, but that course was not followed. The vital information on which we could base our judgment of the bill is not available. If we knew that the whole of the increase was to be devoted to the payment of attendance money we should have no objection to the measure, but it seems, on the evidence before us, that a large proportion of the amount that will be derived from the increase will be used for other purposes. </para>

                    <para>The fact that the Government has introduced this measure, about which it has given us so little information, during the dying hours of a session is, in a way, a blow at democracy. The practice of introducing unpopular legislation, accompanied by inadequate information, in the last hours of a session can be the death-knell of democracy. Bill after bill has been passed through this House during the last few days. That is legislation by exhaustion. We are asked to sit in this chamber until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., and then we are expected to attend the sitting next day and examine important matters judicially. We are critical of the methods that the Government is using and of the inadequacy of the information that it has given to us. This bill provides evidence that unemployment, either full or partial, is more rampant in the community than the Government prepares to admit. Full employment has disappeared so far as waterside workers are concerned. It has certainly disappeared so far as workers in many other industries are concerned, because it is certain that when a smaller volume of goods is entering our ports there is a smaller quantity available for sale and less spending in the community. All these factors affect employment. This bill gives, in miniature,  a  picture of the Government's ineptitude. </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened with considerable interest to the remarks of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crean).</inline> Perhaps the most astonishing suggestion that he made was that the introduction of this measure in the closing stages of the session could be the death-knell of democracy. No more ludicrous comment r, 0111(1 be made. Many of us, including honorable members who were not members of the Eighteenth Parliament, which was controlled by honorable members opposite, know well how the business of the Parliament was conducted- during  the regime of the Chifley Government. It was not unusual for that Government to dispose of millions of. pounds of public money in the early hours of the morning, even as late as 4 a.m. or 6 a.m. At the end of a session lasting fourteen weeks it is ludicrous for the honorable member for Melbourne Ports to make such a suggestion as he has made, particularly when we remember how honorable members opposite have wasted time in the last few days by .calling for unnecessary divisions, and have thereby eaten into the time available for debate on important measures. The honorable member has stated that inflation, which, he. alleges to be the result of this Government's policy, has made it necessary for this bill to be introduced. One of the biggest contributing factors to inflation has been the increase of costs that has resulted from the activities of Communists in the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia. They have done a great deal more to increase inflation by delaying the loading and unloading of ships, than any Government has done. The honorable member also tried to show that the actions of the Government have substantially increased unemployment on the waterfront. That statement is foolish. There must always be variations in employment in any community, whether it be democratic or socialistic. An economy is never static. There are always variations in employment in certain industries. Certain classes of workers are unemployed at certain periods. It is ridiculous for the honorable member to introduce the subjects of inflation and unemployment into this debate. Unemployment and inflation are the results of the normal working of the economy. The reason for the increased charges provided for in the measure is that the moneys that have come into the fund that is used to pay attendance money have not balanced payments that have been made from the fund. The measure aims to place the fund back «n a basis of equilibrium. It is expected that the increase provided for will put the fund on a par basis within approximately twelve months. This is a reasonable approach to the problem. The Government might easily have decided to impose a heavier charge to produce equilibrium in a shorter period, after which the charge could have been reduced, but it has decided instead to spread the increase over a period so that the increased cost of goods, the prices of which will be affected by the charge, will not be too burdensome to the community. The increase of attendance payments is outside the control of this Parliament. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court decided that attendance money should be increased from 12s. to 16s. a day. That, in itself, imposes a further obligation on  the fund, but the biggest contributing factor is the decline in the volume of inward cargoes. That position can be directly attributed to the imposition of import restrictions recently. I am one of those persons who make no apology for the introduction of those restrictions. Every member of the community who understands the situation, with the possible exception of those persons who have been seriously affected as individuals by the restrictions, appreciates the fact that the Government, in imposing them, has adopted the proper course in the interests of the greatest number of people. Many businesses were virtually saved from bankruptcy as the result of the imposition of the restrictions. In the administration of matters such as import restrictions, anomalies almost invariably occur, but the Minister has taken prompt action to remove them as soon as they have been brought to his notice. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Nevertheless, the imposition of import restrictions has had a serious effect on the waterfront, and has produced a great deal more unemployment temporarily than existed when goods were entering this country in such vast quantities that the public could not possibly consume them within a reasonable period. I believe that the existing situation is only temporary, and that, as the honorable member for Evans has stated, import restrictions will be tapered off in the notdistant future. The result will be an increasing flow of imports, with a bigger volume of inward cargoes and, consequently, more employment on the waterfront. Some overseas shipowners suggested recently, that despite the conditions  now prevailing, consideration should be given to the advisability of increasing the supply of labour on the  waterfront at the present time. I do not agree with that suggestion, but before many months have elapsed, the . conditions that existed only a few months ago may return, and the turn-round of ships in Australian ports may be considerably slowed down. </para>
                    <para>The last matter to which I shall refer relates to freights. The first question that the electorate will ask is whether the increase of the stevedoring industry charge by 175 per cent, will be reflected in a considerable increase of the cost of goods. I shall deal briefly with that matter. At the present time, the freight and handling charge for general cargo between Sydney and Melbourne is 135s. 6d. a ton. The increase of the stevedoring industry charge from 4d. to lid. a man-hour, if it were added to the freightwould increase it by approximately ls. 2d. a ton. That could justify only a small increase in the actual price of goods. However, I believe that shipowners should not find it necessary to pass the additional ls. 2d. a ton on to the consuming public. Since the turn-round of ships has been speeded up, ' overseas vessels and those engaged in the Australian coastal trade can be run more economically. That saving should enable shipowners to bear the additional charge. They should not pass it on to the consuming public. In view of the various factors that I have outlined, I consider that the Government is justified in introducing this bill. If the stevedoring industry charge is not increased, the additional expense must be borne by the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and, hence, will be a tax payable by the community. The principle embodied in the principal act is that the employers of labour on the waterfront shall meet the cost of attendance money and the charges of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. I whole-heartedly support the measure. </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CLYDE</inline>
                        CAMERON (Hindmarsh) T5.37]. - The purpose of this bill is to increase the stevedoring industry charge from 4d. to lid. a man-hour. If I am a reliable prophet of what is likely to happen, the Government will discover, as time passes, that lid. will not be sufficient to meet the commitments of the Stevedoring Industry Board. My reason for expressing that opinion is that I consider it will not be long before the attendance money will have to be reviewed. In any event, the amount will have to be considerably increased, whether or not it is reviewed, because an increasing number of waterside workers will be unable to get jobs. "When the charge was originally imposed, attendance money was fixed at 12s. a, day, which was equivalent to 60s. a week. I ask honorable members to bear in mind the fact that; at that time, the unemployment benefit for a married man with children was 50s. a week. To-day, the unemployment benefit payable to a person in that category is 100s. a week, yet the attendance money payable to a waterside worker is only 16s. a day, or SOs. a week. In other words, the waterside worker, who has a family, receives 20s. a week less than the recipient of the unemployment benefit. Surely that position supports my contention that the time is not far distant when the rate of attendance money will have to be reviewed. I am certain that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, in view of those facts, must grant an increase of the amount of attendance money proportionate to the increase of the unemployment benefit.
                    </para>
                    <para>One matter that must be remembered, is that waterside workers, due to the intermittent nature of their work, are often deprived of the unemployment benefit. The Social Services Consolidation Act provides that the unemployment benefit shall not be payable to an applicant until seven days of unemployment have occurred after the date of his application. The effect of that provision is that a waterside worker, when he is unemployed for only seven days, receives SOs. attendance money totally, whereas a married man with a family receives 100s. a week as unemployment benefit. </para>

                        <para>- It is an obvious anomaly, which should be adjusted without delay. Attendance money, on the basis of the figures I have given, should be increased to at least 24s. :i day. When attendance money was fixed at 12s. a day, which was equal to 00s. a week, the unemployment benefit payable to a married man with dependent children was only 50s. a week. At the present time, the unemployment benefit payable to a person in that category is 100s. a week - an increase of 100 per cent. Attendance money has been increased by only 33^ per cent. This Government is always the last authority to admit the worsening of the inflationary conditions since it has been in office, but it has been forced to admit that inflation justifies an increase of the unemployment benefit, by 1.00 per cent. How, then, could the Government oppose an application to thu court by the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia for an increase of the original rate of attendance money by a similar percentage? </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Yesterday, 1,100 waterside workers in Port Adelaide were unable to obtain employment. That position will certainly grow worse as time passes. Is there any wonder, then, that the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia has considered it prudent to resist efforts to compel it to open its books to new members? Recent events have completely vindicated the policy of the federation in resisting attempts that this Government was making, and, indeed, is still making behind the scenes, to compel the organization to agree to the admission of an unlimited number of members. There are far too many members in the federation already, and I hope that the Government will cease, its efforts to bring pressure to bear on it to admit additional members, in view of the fact that work cannot be found for all the members of the organization at the present time. The Government does not mind paying attendance money at the rate of SOs. a week to waterside workers when it knows that if those persons were not members of the union, they would be entitled to claim the unemployment benefit of 100s. a week. The Government apparently hopes that, with men  0'it  of work, it will be able to break down the union's will to fight for the rights of its members. If the federation has any brains, it will note the tendency of the Government to bring economic pressure to bear in order to break down the discipline of the organi- zation  and, ultimately, completely smash it as an instrument to protect the right9 of its members. </para>

The members at Port Adelaide of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, are not Communists. They are a fine group of hard-working mon who have always given of their best. Many of them have been life-long members of the Australian Labour party, and the number of Communists at Port Adelaide, if, indeed, there are any, is so small as to be completely negligible. The secretary at Port Adelaide of the local branch of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia has been a life-long member of the Australian Labour party, as has every member of his executive except one. Those men have spent their lives fighting communism. Their method of fighting is not to make charges under the privilege of this Parliament, and not to write articles in the capitalist press ; they have fought in the only effective way possible, and that is to show that an Australian Labor party union official can do his job better than a Communist official can. If honorable members on the Government side had their way, they would destroy the efforts of all non-Communist union officials to protect their members, and then the rank and file would believe that there was only one system that could help them and that was communism. </para>

                        <para>.- I would not have risen to take part in this debate merely to answer the diatribes of the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clyde Cameron).</inline> A person as jaundiced as the honorable member for Hindmarsh, surely could not have any beliefs at all. If his credo is as hopeless a's he would have ns believe, the best service that he could do for this community would be to re-examine his thoughts and philosophy and ascertain whether his credo is worth maintaining. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports is in a different position in that he alleged that there was something sinister about the increased charges. Honorable members opposite are prepared to accept this bill if the total amount raised by way of increased charge is paid as attendance money to waterfront workers for whom there is no work on certain days. That is, they want the increased charge to be paid as attendance money. The Auditor-General's report points out not only what amounts . have been expended on waterside workers' attendance money, but also the amounts that have been expended in other directions. There has been an insinuation in most of what has been said by honorable members opposite that there is something wrong with this proposal, and that the: money raised by the legislation will be used for ulterior purposes. Therefore, it is worth while to draw attention to the conditions with which the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board has had to deal. This board was established by the previous Government, and continues under this Government to carry out special activities. Honorable members opposite have, in effect, challenged the integrity of the board, and have suggested that there is something sinister in what the board has been doing. The board is designed to regulate and control a variety of stevedoring operations, such as to develop port facilities, to provide at each port sufficient waterside workers for stevedoring operations and ensure that that labour is used to the best advantage, to pay attendance money to waterside workers and arrange proper amenities for them, to arrange for the training of persons in the waterside industry and to publish information relating to that industry. The Australian Stevedoring Industry Board has, in fact, provided cafeteria facilities in the ports. The money raised for the board is being used in all the activities that I have detailed, and there is no doubt that had there been anything wrong with, the board's operations the Auditor-General would have drawn attention 'to it. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> complained that whereas the volume of port labour had been permanently swollen the growth in post-war shipping had been only temporary. Surely he would not have disagreed with the policy of throwing open the markets of Australia to the industries of the world in order that there would be a supply of goods sufficient to arrest the inflation that was developing in this country. Surely he would not disagree that, the corollary is also true, because it cannot be too often emphasized that, if people like honorable members of the Labour party - honest as they are - had  not failed to inform the workers that they could get out of industry only what they put into it, and if they had been as willing to exhort the worker to put his back into his job as they were to defend him against the attacks of others, there would not have been half the inflationary troubles that we are faced with to-day. Goods would have been approximately equal to the money available and we would not have had to face our present problems. This bill is bound up with the de-casualization of labour, and such decasualization is desirable. We require that men should be available for work, and therefore if there is no work available for them they must get a recompense for making themselves available. Much has been said about the failure to consult the parties affected. I hope that we can develop to a stage where we can have that type of joint consultation between the workers, the shipowners and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board which has been so effective in other parts of the world. I hope that such joint consultation will ultimately become part of our ordinary industrial relationships. If we could have that joint consultation, and not merely eq-operation, we would have an entirely different picture to paint about our industrial problems. This bill will meet the difficulties that have arisen in the waterfront industry, and I am sure that those difficulties are ephemeral, and that as a result of this Government's actions we shall be able not merely to halt inflation but also to attract to our ports ships loaded with imports and send a way ships loaded with our vast harvests. When that state of affairs occurs we shall have reached the turning point in our fight against inflation. I believe that the coming year will be one of such prosperity that there will not be enough waterside workers to cope with the work that we shall have on our wharfs. </para>

                        <para>.- It is evident from the fact that the. Government proposes to make such a tremendous increase of the stevedoring charge that it anticipates substantial and prolonged unemployment in the industry. Since the sitting was suspended, I have taken the opportunity to peruse the speeches that were made by some honorable members opposite when they were in Opposition on the measure under which the Chifley Government established the system of payment of attendance money to watersiders who reported for work but for whom no employment could be found. Strangely enough, I found that honorable members opposite who now appear to see merit in this scheme vigorously opposed its introduction at that time. The Australian Labour party and the Waterside Workers Federation have long been in favour of de-casualizing the industry, but this Government does not propose to meet the wishes of the waterside workers who are anxious not to receive attendance money but to obtain regular employment. This proposal to increase the stevedoring charge from 4d. to lid. an hour indicates that the Government anticipates that the amount of money that will be required to finance attendance money payments will be. tremendously increased. As the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clyde Cameron)</inline> has pointed out, many waterside workers do not obtain more than one day's work in a week. Such men are actually worse off financially than they would -be if they and the members of their  families received social services benefits in the normal way. Thus, the Government is not giving any great concession to these men. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Opposition believes that a proper examination should be made in order to ascertain whether the proposed increase is absolutely necessary. I have heard it said, and so far no Government supporter has refuted this contention, that much of the overhead expenditure incurred in the administration of this scheme could be obviated. The Waterside Workers Federation i3 of that opinion. The Australian Labour party has no objection to a tax on the basis of hours worked on the waterfront for the purpose of financing the payment of attendance money to workers who report for work but for whom no employment is available. I repeat that a Labour government introduced this scheme. But, as the Government now proposes to increase the stevedoring charge to Hd. an bour, it should extend the scheme under which this payment is made available. Government supporters have admitted that it is necessary to pay attendance money to waterside workers in order to maintain a labour force that will be adequate to meet any sudden increase of shipping activities. I emphasize that waterside workers, are not the only category of employees who are essential to the carrying on of the industry. Tally clerks, for instance, are essential to the efficient working of the waterfront and provision should be made for the payment of attendance money to tally clerks if, when they report for duty, no employment is available for them. Another section of workers on the waterfront to whom attendance money is not paid are those whose names are registered on what is called the veterans' list. They are the older members of the Waterside Workers Federation. Many of them have worked in the industry for over 30 years and some of them are suffering from disabilities due, in many instances, to war causes. Persons whose names appear on the veterans' list are not obliged to report for work as regularly as are other members of the federation, but a number of them, nevertheless, report for work regularly, and when no work is available for them they are not paid attendance money. These men, who pioneered the industry, are not treated in the same way as are other members of the federation. The differentiation is causing a great deal of dissatisfaction on the waterfront. In recent years, when imports were flooding into this country, the Government forced the federation to throw open its books for the admission of new members. Many who were admitted to membership of the federation in those circumstances are new Australians; some of them, I understand, are former enemy subjects. ' I do not object to the payment of attendance money to such persons so long as they are employed on the waterfront, but one reason why the dissatisfaction to which I have referred is increasing, is that Australian ex-servicemen whose names appear on the veterans list, and who are not paid attendance money  when no work is available for them strongly object to attendance money being paid to former enemy subjects whom the Government has brought to. this country. There is some justification for that complaint. I have no objection to any waterside worker being paid attendance money; but I certainly believe that these veteran Australian ex-servicemen should not he denied that benefit. As a result of this increase of the stevedoring charge the revenue that will be derived under this heading will be substantially increased. Therefore, benefit from this fund should be made available to every section of the industry, including tally clerks who are essential to its smooth working. </para>
                    <para>On previous occasions, Government supporters claimed that trouble on the waterfront, including the slow turn-round of ships, had been due to the activities of &amp; few Communists. Now, the Government has been forced to admit that the slow turn-round of ships was not due to the failure of the waterside workers to work as hard as Government supporters would like to see them working, but to the fact that wharf accommodation was inadequate to receive the tremendous volume of goods that flooded this country before the present restriction was placed on imports'. At that time, warehouses and' wharfs were- cluttered' up with good's, and in many centres goods were stacked on roadways where they were a hindrance to traffic. The Government now recognizes that the slow turn-round of ships has been due to this confusion on the wharfs rather than to go-slow practices on the part of the waterside workers. The Opposition does not object to the proposal to increase the stevedoring charge so long as it is shown to be justified. However, every increase of these charges aggravates the inflationary spiral, because, whilst it may he argued that this tax is paid by the industry, the Australian consumer ultimately is obliged to pay it in the form of increased prices. The argument of Government supporters that it has arrested inflation cannot be reconciled with the introduction of this measure under which the stevedoring charge is to be increased from 4d. to Hd. an hour. This proposal gives the lie to such arguments. The honorable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne)</inline> was particularly concerned, as he usually is in any debate in this House, to make an unjustified attack upon the New South Wales Government. On this occasion he selected for attack that Government's appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGirr,</inline> the ex-Premier of New South Wales, to the chairmanship of the Maritime Services Board. However, the honorable member produced no evidence whatever to support his claim that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGirr</inline> had not been able to perform, the duties of that position efficiently but merely made a general statement which suggested that because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGirr</inline> had been associated with the Australian Labour party in New South Wales he could not possibly fill the position successfully. I am able to say that as a result of inquiries that I have made in authoritative quarters, I have learned that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGirr</inline> has been doing an excellent job in that position. Of course, Government supporters are of the opinion that no person who has been associated with the Australian Labour party could possibly be a success in such a position. So great, is their abhorrence of Labour that they believe that any Labour man who was appointed to such a position would be a hindrance to the industry concerned. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bland)</inline> adopted a peculiar attitude towards this measure, as he does towards most measures that are introduced in this chamber. He implied that the waterside workers had been principally responsible for difficulties that had occurred in the industry. He said that those workers could not expect to take out of a job more than they put into it. That is the old to ry argument. The honorable professor, whether he believes that the workers arn going slow, or fast, cannot get past the fact that all wealth is produced by the workers. I hope that the honorable professor, when he has an opportunity to do so, will develop his argument on this point and indicate how wealth is produced except by the workers. Whether it be in peace or war, the whole security of the country depends upon the workers. As a matter of fact, speeches like that which the honorable professor- </para>

He makes a practice of speaking on practically every subject that is raised in this House as though he were an authority on it. He should confine his attention to subjects in respect of which he has had some experience. As I have said, profits arc produced basically by the efforts of the workers. </para>

The Government might be able to indicate the volume of labour that it considers it will be necessary to retain in the stevedoring industry. I am not suggesting that any person now employed in the industry should be retired; but the honorable member for Evans, supported by the honorable member for Warringah, talked about the possibility of the Waterside Workers Federation closing its books. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Government, apparently, intends to maintain a large number of waterside workers permanently unemployed. That is the implication in the proposal that is embodied in this bill. In spite of the payment of attendance money the majority of waterside workers are not earning on the average more than the basic wage., The earnings of many of them, in fact, are less than the basic wage. If this is to be a permanent condition in the industry, many of these men will be obliged to drift into other industries. </para>
                    <para>If the Government wants to retain sufficient labour in the waterfront industries to deal with any increase of the volume nf imports, it should increase the attendance fee. A payment of 16s. a day is not enough to give to a worker who is obliged to report for work daily. I am sure that honorable members ontheGovernment side of the chamber would not be very favorably disposed in the payment of members of Parliament on the same basis because, in that event, many of them would not receive their full salaries. An examination of the attendance records in this House would show that many honorable members who argue that a worker must be available for work at all times when he is required are not diligently attentive to their duties in this place, for which they are very well paidi </para>
                    <para>The Opposition considers that the higher charge will eventually lead to an increase of the cost of living. Therefore, it contends that the House should not lightly agree to an increase of over 200 per cent, without making a proper examination of all the relevant circumstances. Upon what basis did the Government establish the proposed new charge? Was a proper examination made of the conditions of the industry, or did the Government merely accept the recommendation of somebody associated with the industry who has not been named during this debate? Such an increase should not be made without a proper examination of the facts. That is why the Leader of the Opposition has asked for an inquiry to bc conducted. We do not propose to vote against the bill, because we do not want to deny to the waterside workers and others, who, I believe, ought to receive attendance money, the benefit of the proposed increase. At the same time, we consider that the Government should examine very carefully the allegations that have been made, not only by the workers in the industry, but also by representatives of some of the shipping companies, that the overhead charges of the Stevedoring Industry Board are excessive. I sup port the proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition. Even if it has been ruled out of order by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. . Speaker,</inline> the Government should heed the suggestion that is implicit in it. The Government should make a full statement of the facts to the Parliament if it hopes to justify the proposed increase. </para>

Who will decide whether a seaman intends not to return to hh? ship? The Opposition cannot accept a provision under which a man may be classed as a deserter on the decision of some undisclosed authority concerning his intentions. The existing definition has worked satisfactorily as far as I have been able to ascertain, and, therefore, I fail to see any justification for the proposal in this bill. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> of the definition which I have quoted will introduce a new principle by laying down that, if a seaman is absent without leave, lawful cause or reasonable excuse for a period of 48 hours, he may he regarded as a deserter. According to the provisions of the bill, there will be many grounds on. which a seaman may be classed as a deserter and on which his discharge may bc branded. The Opposition hoped that, after it had pointed out the injustice of the provision during the second-reading debate, the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> would decide to withdraw it. Any such provision,, which authorizes an individual to judge the intentions of another individual, must lead inevitably to discontent. The Minister said during his second-reading speech that, despite the efforts of the Maritime Industry Commission and the arbitral tribunal, the shipping industry had suffered many hold-ups caused by petty industrial disputes and the refusal of the Seamen's Union of Australia, in defiance of the commission or the findings of conciliation commissioners, to man vessels. That may be so, but it does not provide a reason why this harsh provision in relation to desertion should be inserted in the act. The Opposition will not accept it in its present form. The act now provides adequately for the treatment of deserters, and the Government has given no valid reason in support of the proposed new definition. </para>

                        <para>- I shall try to do so if the Opposition will refrain from interrupting me. If the definition of " desertion " is of such an onerous character as the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison)</inline> has implied, it is remarkable that a similar provision should have served for so long under various governments of different political colours in the sister dominion of New Zealand. The Government has found, in practice, that the present definition of " desertion " is not entirely satisfactory, because . it throws upon the shipping authorities the onus of proving that desertion occurred with intent on the part of the seaman concerned. It is a very difficult matter to prove intention. A ship may be held up, but proper disciplinary action may be prevented because of the lack of such proof. In New Zealand, this difficulty is overcome by the inclusion in the relevant statute of the following definition in relation to desertion: - </para>

There should be no fear that injustice will be done. Ear from being oppressive, this provision' will meet the situation without causing hardship.

                        <para>- The official note that has been supplied to me for the information of the committee on this clause states that the present definition of " desertion " leads to difficulties. For example, a man :may be absent from his ship and give no indication of desertion. The master is then inconvenienced and the departure of his ship may be delayed because he cannot engage a substitute until close to the time fixed for sailing, when it becomes clear that the man does not propose to return. This might occur at a week-end or at night, and, in such cases, the master would be forced to await the next regular pick-up of seamen. If a man can be written off articles when he remains absent for 48 hours and it is clear that he is avoiding work, the position of the master will be greatly strengthened. In many cases he will be able to engage a substitute before his sailing time is due. If in any case it transpired that an injustice had been done to a seaman by classing him as a deserter when later information showed that, iii fact, he was not a deserter, it would be an easy matter to amend the record. The New Zealand act contains a good definition which says that a man shall be guilty of desertion if he remains absent from his ship without lawful cause or excuse for 48 hours. Therefore, it is proposed to make a similar addition to the definition in our act. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not go into details of that kind. Doubtless there are some aspects of our legislation that New Zealand could copy usefully. This provision will tend to strengthen an aspect of our legislation that is regarded as unsatisfactory. During the second-reading debate, the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clarey)</inline> urged strongly that there should be consultation with representatives of the unions affected by the measure. A request was made to the Government to receive a deputation from those unions. Subsequently, the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Mcleay)</inline> and I received such a deputation, and heard the views that the members put forward. Then we decided to hold a meeting in Sydney, not only with representatives of the unions but also with representatives of the shipowners, of the Department of Shipping and Transport, and of the Department of Labour and National Service. As a result of that meeting, the Government has altered its policy in relation to several of the clauses in the measure, and will move a number of amendments to the bill. I do not claim that those amendments will meet completely the requests that were made to us by the unions. For that matter, the bill as it stands does not include, by any means, all that the shipowners desire should he contained in it. </para>

                <para>Wo set out originally to deal with two principal phases of the problem. First, the Maritime Industry Commission could not bo supported indefinitely by the National Security Regulation under which it was constituted. Therefore, some legislation was required to continue either the commission itself or the practices that the commission had established during its existence. The Government felt that, as the act made provision for a. marine council that was representative of all interests in the industry, there was n&lt;&gt; need to continue the Maritime Indus.try Commission, and that the legislation could be suitably amended to incorporate the practices which the commission had established as a result of its experience. We considered that the industrial problems of the industry had not been dealt with entirely satisfactorily under the conciliation commission system, and decided that, owing to the special industrial questions that arise in the industry, it should be placed under the general supervision of a judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court so far as such questions were concerned. The amendments that will be moved in the committee will not affect those two aspects of the matter. The Government has not altered its policy of abolishing the Maritime Industry Commission, and it intends to proceed with its proposal that industrial questions shall be dealt with by a judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. But, as a result of the discussions that we have had with representatives of the trade unions and of the shipowners, we propose to move some amendments of the bill. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that all of the maritime unions were represented at the Sydney conference. We have notgone all the way that the unions wanted ns to go. They did not want the com mission to be abolished, nor did they want industrial questions to be dealt with by a judge. But several of the clauses to which they took some exception have been re-examined, and I think that, when the clauses have been amended, they will be much more acceptable to the unions than they are now. </para>

                <para class="block">If a seaman were absent from his ship for only two hours, and if somebody - the definition does not say who it should be, and the Minister is not. sure - arrivedat the conclusion that he did not propose to return to his ship, he would be branded as a deserter. So far, no light lias been thrown upon two points. The first point is : how long must elapse before somebody can determine that a seaman does not intend to return to his ship? The second point is : who is the authority who will make that decision ? The statement by the Minister of the position in New Zealand strengthens the case of the Opposition, because the New Zealand legislation provides that a man cannot be regarded as a deserter until he has been absent from his ship for  48  hours. </para>
                <para>If the intention of the Government was only to enable some authority to deal with a man whom the authority believed had no intention to return to his ship, I cannot see why it was necessary to alter the definition of desertion, which is described as the absence of a seaman or apprentice from his ship without lawful cause or excuse. The words "without lawful cause or excuse " have been excluded from the new provision. </para>

                        <para>- It is intended to be provocative. Absences of this description have visited ruin on the coastal shipping trade of our country which should be, if it be nothing else, a maritime nation. It is because previous legislation has not included provision to. cover these offences that our shipping has been reduced to a hollow sham. Everything that the honorable member for Blaxland said in connexion with this clause is calculated to excite sympathy for deserters without any consideration being given to the industry, the other crew members and the passengers who are waiting to sail, and the consignors and consignees of cargo. Members of the Opposition object to a provision under which a deserter shall have to suffer a penalty for a dereliction of duty. They have no consideration for all the persons and authorities who are put to great trouble because of the failure of a seaman to report for duty by sailing time. </para>

                        <para>- I am confining myself, to it so far as I am able. I say that it is vital to the efficient operation of a shipping service that a penalty should be provided for the offence of desertion, and that it should be described in its proper terms. If the situation were to be met by a paltry fine, or by some similar penalty, the provision would not have any merit as a punitive measure. A member of a crew, whether he be a seaman, an apprentice or anybody else, who shows intent not to be on board his vessel at sailing time, and absents himself for 48 hours', invites and deserves the opprobrium of being classed as a " deserter ". </para>

                    <para>.- If ever a speech could be regarded as an incitement to workers to take direct action it was the speech of the honorable member for Riverina (Mi-. Roberton). I take it that it is the Government's purpose, or at least its declared purpose, to preserve peace in the maritime industry. It is a serious matter for a member of this Parliament to refer to the absence of a man who has failed to report to his ship as being always a case of desertion. He makes no allowance, for occasions when seamen may have legitimate reasons- for failing to report to their ships. The honorable member made no distinction between various kinds* of absences-, but merely- referred to seamen as deliberately absenting themselves from their ships. He said such a  situation  ought not to be met by  a paltry  fine. If the honorable member  were to  speak his mind he would probably  suggest  that such men should be sent to the  firing  squad. The Minister for Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Hasluck) said that the person who  would  determine whether or not a man should be classified as a deserter would  be  the master of the vessel concerned.  Honorable  members should be fully appreciative of the serious position that arises  when a  man has been classified as a  deserter.  That is a very serious allegation  to be made  against any man, and a seriousstigma to be placed on him. The  right of  making this decision is to be placed  in  the hands of the master of the vessel,  but  the Minister says that so long as  the  seaman who absented himself has a  lawful  cause or a reasonable excuse for  his  absence, he may satisfy the master  of thevessel  to that effect. When will  hesatisfy  the master? I take it that  the  ship concerned would not be delayed  until  such time as the seaman had an opportunity to argue his case with the master.. I take it that the vessel would sail immediately it was able to sail, leaving  theabsent  seaman behind, and that  themaster  would report to the marine superintendent that the seaman was a  deserterbecause  he had not reported for  duty.  The seaman concerned might have  a  reasonable excuse for having failed  toreport  on time. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I ask the Minister to say at what  stagethe  seaman would have the opportunity to argue with the master whether  or not  he had a lawful cause or a reasonableexcuse for his absence. This provision will not produce peace in the maritimeindustry. As a matter of fact, I venture the opinion that it is not the intention  of  the Government to preserve peace  in theindustry.  I think that the Government is spoiling- for a fight with certain  of  thetrade unions, and has deliberately  introduced  provocative legislation with  that,  end in view, because, after all is said  and'  done, the shipping industry has not  had  any major disputes in recent times.  Asa  matter of fact, if honorable  members  will examine the records- they will  find  that although it. is perfectly true  that  there have always: been spasmodic  holdups  in the maritime industry; they  have  been caused in many instances by the fact that the seamen have had to fight to maintain the working conditions that they have won for themselves. The inclusion in the measure of such a provocative provision as this shows the complete and absolute ignorance of the Government about the industry. A man who is absent from his vessel for a few hours may, as the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison)</inline> has said, be classified as a deserter if the master of the vessel is of the opinion that he has no intention to return to work. He may have been kept away from work as a result of illness or another legitimate cause. Even if he has reported to the master to that effect, and the master is not satisfied that he is telling the truth, he may still be branded as :a deserter. In my opinion that provision is deliberately provocative, and I hope that the Government will have the good sense to alter it, as it will do if it really wishes to establish in the public mind that it desires to preserve peace in the industry. </para>

I regret to say that the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison)</inline> has also done so. Clause  4  contains an amended definition of " desertion ". The existing act defines desertion as -   . . the absence of a seaman or apprentice from his ship without lawful cause or excuse, with the intention of not returning thereto: - </para>

                <para class="block">The amended definition defines two different classes of desertion, as follows : - </para>
                <list type="loweralpha">
                    <item label="(a)">

                                <para>the absence of a seaman or apprentice from his ship for a continuous period exceeding forty-eight hours without leave, lawful cause or reasonable excuse : </para>

                <para class="block">If a man employed on a ship under articles leaves the ship with the intention of not returning, it does . not matter what the cause or excuse may be, he has committed desertion. That has been the case for centuries, and is the case under the existing law, because there can be no lawful cause or reasonable excuse for forming the intention to desert. I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> is now in the chamber, because perhaps he will be kind enough to listen to my remarks and inform his two colleagues of the correctness of my contentions. If a man leaves a ship on shore leave, discovers that his wife is ill and goes to visit her with the intention of returning to the ship but fails to return on board in time, he has not committed desertion. Under this measure, or the existing measure, if he was the victim of an accident and could not return to the ship, he would not have committed desertion, because he would not have formed the intention of not returning. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition will concur with that view.. The essence of desertion is the formation of an intention to desert, and there could be no lawful cause or reasonable excuse for an intention not to return. Therefore the omission of the words "without lawful cause or excuse " means nothing. </para>
                <para>Che necessity for the definition of the second class of desertion lies in the fact that it is extremely difficult, in a court of law, to prove intention. The defendant only has to say that he did not have such an intention, but had some other intention, and it is impossible to disprove his statement. His intentions can be proved only by his conduct. It has been found by experience that seamen can desert and the offence cannot be proved against them in court. This amendment is therefore reasonable. If a seaman is absent from his ship for  48  hours he will be deemed to be a deserter unless he has leave, or has a lawful cause or reasonable excuse for his absence. In other words, a man who  iV  absent for  48  hours will bear the onus of showing that he had a lawful cause  or  reasonable excuse for his absence.  If  the Opposition were in office it might well introduce such an amendment, because it is so obviously necessary. No responsible law-abiding seaman or trade union official would object to it. </para>
                <para>The bill provides ample safeguards. A great deal of nonsense has been talked about who is to decide whether a man has a lawful cause or reasonable excuse for his absence. As I promised the honorable member for Blaxland, I shall try to explain to him who is to decide the issue. Desertion is an offence under the Navigation Act, and may be followed by prosecution in a court of law.  If  a man deserts, and the master of the vessel concerned decides to prosecute him; the person who will decide whether the man has a lawful cause or reasonable excuse for his absence will be the magistrate who presides over the court. It is a perfectly ordinary and normal obligation of the magistrate to decide whether or not a person had lawful cause or excuse for doing what he did. </para>
                <para>Another consequence of desertion is that a man is given a bad discharge. It is the duty and obligation of the master to give a seaman a discharge when he leaves his ship. If the seaman has deserted the ship, he will be marked as having a bad discharge. The master of the ship has, under the amending legislation, as under the act, and as he has had in British ships for generations, an obligation to decide whether a seaman has deserted. That decision must be exercised judiciously. If it is not so exercised, the seaman may appeal. A method is provided, if a seaman is debarred by a superintendent from being employed in a ship, to appeal to the court, and so he has, indirectly, the right of appeal to the judge against an unfair decision as to whether or not he had a lawful excuse. I hope that I have been able to establish that there is no foundation for the complaints made by the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Riverina, beyond having, quite curiously, a. red rose in his jacket, made no contribution to the question of why sailors temporarily desert, or do not rejoin their ships on time. The honorable member for Evans, who has had a much closer experience of these matters, should have made a more human approach to the problem, but he spoke of what we should do, and the sanctions that we should apply against seamen. Why? In his service at sea during the war, he was most patriotic. In his attitude to-night, he is merely voicing the claims of the commercial man who speaks of the profits to be made out of the industry of the sailor. A case has not been made out by the honorable gentleman. He has spoken in terms of discipline without understanding what really happens in the commercial set-up, and what are the reasons why sailors desert their ships. There is no reason why this " pukka " attitude should be followed by other honorable members. </para>

                <para>But I must return to the honorable  member for Riverina, who fascinates me. I cannot understand how that land-bound sailor eventually made his way to the coast, and eventually launched himself, in any shape or form, as a ship of the line - either a commercial line or a. line of battle. But he speaks with great authority from 300 miles from the coastline, and pontificates upon' these matters with ail the dignity of a wheat-grower who has never seen a sailor, except on a talkie " short " exhibited in the Senate clubroom in this building. </para>
                <para>But let us get back to common cases. The sailor is a human being, with all the anxieties, inhibitions and difficulties of a worker who sometimes has a bad ship, and sometimes a. good ship ; who is sometimes bored with life, and is sometimes pleased with life. If he does not get back to the ship at five bells or eight bells, the honorable member for Evans considers that he should be punished. The honorable gentleman knows when the bells are rung. He was probably late on one occasion, but being an officer, he was doubtless piped aboard and nothing was said about the incident. Let him  have  some feeling for the ordinary seaman. </para>
                <para>Everybody has been too pious about the matter under consideration. We should always bear in mind that the coal-mining industry and the seafaring industry are the difficult industries in which men of turbulent natures are employed. The Government will not achieve its objective by pious aspirations. We must get down to the common basis, which has been proposed by the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison).</inline></para>

                        <para>- We should remember that during the last war the merchant service had casualties off the Australian coast comparable with those suffered by British seamen generally. Australians in the merchant service were heroes. They were not covered by the Repatriation Act and were not provided with houses under that legislation. They were at a loose end. If the frustration of the sailor is apparent in the provisions of this bill, we should correct, it by doing something for the man. instead of assailing him. We referred to the men of the merchant navy during the last war as heroes. The honorable member for St. George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Graham)</inline> - that noble name - always seems to ring a peal of bells in my mind, indicating a love of justice and fair play, and the slaying of the dragon. I think he will agree with me  when I say that we have two thoughts about the seaman. During the war,  the  men, who kept the ships sailing, and took the transports through in a seamanlike, manner were heroes, or " 4-- - '"' <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> Kipling called them. Since the war, they are the objects of hatred to men who are twenty years behind the times in their thinking. If honorable  members  opposite will consider the statements made by the Opposition on this matter, they will recognize the validity of our submissions. </para>

                <para>AH the talk about " going aboard " and " getting the ship away " is out of place in this debate. Such things simply did not happen. They never happened when Britannia ruled the waves in every sense of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> word. Men had to be impressed into the Royal Navy. Much nonsensical twaddle has been talked about these matters. The sailor does not work by the bell. There are many frustrations in his mind which may cause him to miss his ship. We should be logical in this matter, and apply human factors rather than silly rule of thumb ideas by legislation. I  impress one point upon honorable members. The men whom we are defaming or deriding, are human beings. Yet they have been referred to in the debate as a " component of industrial unrest ". They are the same persons who saw us through the crisis during the last war. No one knows that better than the honorable member for Evans. This matter should be debated with that thought in mind. It should not be discussed on the basis of the master of the ship on the one hand, and the men on the other hand. Who keeps the ships moving? I think that if the captain went A.W.L., the ship could still put to sea, and pick him up at the next port if he travelled there by air. A greater authority than I wrote - </para>

Let us have no more talk of desertion, regimentation, and the like. Let us have some consideration for an industry with a great seafaring code that has built the Empire and will build this country. Let us show a little toleration for the men who go to the sea in ships and keep them moving, and bring the cargoes in. This matter must be considered, not from the legal standpoint, but from the human standpoint.

The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> who is an eminent legal authority, can assure him that our laws fairly bristle with charges that can be laid against a person who is suspected of having an intention to break the law. This provision is not an inno vation. I do not claim that I admire it, but I realize that it is necessary in our laws. Some one will be required to prove that there was an intention on the part of a seaman to desert his ship. </para>

                        <para>- The circumstances  of  the case will decide the issue. It is futile for Opposition members to imply that  the  master of a ship will approach this matterin an entirely irresponsible way. He will allow the circumstances to dictate his judgment. I do not see any difference between this proposal, and the provisions to which I have referred in  the  criminal and civil codes. The only man who fears and objects to the law is  the  person who intends to break it. It does not matter whether the law relates to  the  matter under consideration, or to speeding, theft or murder. The law-abiding person, who has a sense of responsibility, has nothing to fear from the law. In  the same  way, the honest seaman will not fear this law. The man who will fear it is theseaman who is irresponsible, and is constantly absent from his ship. The seaman who is a couple of hours late will have nothing to fear from this legislation, because he will take some action  to  notify his captain of the reason for his absence. We are not considering  an  absence that delays the sailing of a shipfor a few hours. We should' bear  in  mind the terrific disruption which occursas the result of shipping holdups. The men who are responsible for those conditions are the seamen who do not attempt to inform the captains of their vessels that their absence is due to unavoidablecircumstances. It is as simple as that. The men have nothing to fear if they have no intention to desert. If a man finds that he is unable to notify the ship of his absence and is classed as a deserter he will have the right to get his job on the ship back again. It is unfortunate that because there are a few who offend against the laws, the laws have to imposea penalty that is wide enough to take  insome  of those who do not offend. Every law has the same effect because it  is  designed to protect the community against the operations of wrongdoers. That is all that this bill is designed to  do.  However, I do not think that it goes far enough. I am satisfied that  no seaman fears that he may be classed as a deserter without cause. Therefore, in. spite of the fact that I am not enamoured of laws that are not fully defined with all the " i's " dotted and all the " t's " crossed, I believe that this bill is not a new departure, but that its provisions are similar to the provisions of many other acts of this Parliament. [ have heard, so far, no real argument against the right of an authority to charge a person with an intention to commit an offence. A law such as this is necessary, and I support the clause. </para>

                <para>The bill as it stands has the word "Superintendent" where the words "  Deputy  Director " appear in this amendment. The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> stated that discussion had taken place about this between the Government and the unions concerned, but I cannot imagine either the Seamen's Union of Australasia, or the other organization representing seamen, ever agreeing to a proposition like this. There is very little difference between the amendment and the original clause, to which the Opposition has taken great exception. The amendment means that the organization covering the class of persons who are required to make up a ship's complement will be asked whether it can render any assistance. I join issue with the honorable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne),</inline> who said, during the second-reading debate, that a similar provision was to be found in sections 43 and 44 of the principal act. However, the implications of sections 43 and 44 are that the final determination as to whether or not a ship should go to sea- rests with the Australian Stevedoring Industry Commission, upon which the unions are represented. If the honorable member for Evans doubts that, he should consider these remarks of the Minister for Labour and National Service - </para>

                <para class="block">The Seamen's Union of Australasia had confidence in the commission because it had representatives on it, but it will have no representatives to influence the authority that will decide under this amendment whether a ship is to go to sen. Of course the unions may be consulted, but the  Deputy  Director has the final say. The union has no say in the recommendation of the  Deputy  Director. It is not sufficient for the Minister merely to say that he discussed these matters with the representatives of the unions concerned. As the Leader of the Opposition has suggested, the Minister should have, referred the proposed amendments in draft, form to those representatives and thereby given them an opportunity to deal with the Government's proposal in concrete form. Under this clause, the Government proposes to remove the existing safeguard, which was satisfactory to the Seaman's Union of Australasia in that seamen were assured at all times that no ship would be permitted to put to sea without its full complement. The proposed amendment will not contribute in any way to the maintenance of peace in the industry. I repeat that unless th, authority which is to be empowered to permit a ship to put to sea without its full complement includes a representative of the Seamen's Union of Australasia considerable dissatisfaction will be caused. For that reason the Opposition proposed to support its protest with its vote. </para>

                    (Higgins - Minister for Labour and National Service and Minis  claim that the proposed amendments to this clause are entirely acceptable to the Seamen's Union of Australasia. Earlier, I made it clear that the Government had given consideration to the views of the interested parties and then proceeded to do what it considered to be fair and reasonable. However, these proposed amendments will improve the original proposal from the point of view of the maritime unions. Whereas the original proposal sought to empower a superintendent to give permission to a master, or owner, for a ship to put to sea without its full complement, under the proposed amendment now before the Chair that power will be vested in a higher authority, a.  deputy  director of navigation, who, before granting such permission, will be obliged to satisfy himself that the master, or owner, has made all reasonable efforts to obtain an adequate number of officers in the categories concerned. The amendment will ensure that reasonable efforts shall be made by the master, or owner, to see that a ship is fully manned and permission to put to sea without a full complement will be granted by a  deputy  director of navigation only in an emergency.

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline><inline font-style="italic">E.</inline> . James Harrison) claimed that these proposed new machinery provisions were objectionable to the Seamen's Union of Australasia because they would deprive members of that union of a say in determining whether a ship shall be permitted to put to sea without a full complement. The honorable member is begging the issue. Under sections 43 and 44 of the principal act, the master of a ship is authorized to take it to sea with less than its full complement provided that he has made reasonable efforts to obtain a full complement; and he shall not be guilty of an offence provided that his ship has four-fifths of its complement. However, the fact remains that the principal act contains no provision to enable the master, or owner, in such circumstances, to enforce his decision that the ship shall out to sea. In many instances, ships have been prevented from sailing because the crew has been one man short. </para>

                        <para>. - Notwithstanding anything that the honorable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne)</inline> may have said, clause 10 will authorize a master to take his ship to sea with four-fifths of the normal complement. As the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> said during his second-reading speech, the Maritime Industry Commission has exercised sole authority in such matters up to date, and this has engendered confidence in seamen and others who go to sea in ships. The men knew that, if the commission gave authority for a ship to proceed with less than the prescribed complement, the representatives of their unions on the commission had first considered the proposal and were aware of the conditions under which the vessel was to leave port. The representatives of the men had some influence on the decisions of the commission. The Opposition fears that the Government, by abolishing the commission, will destroy the confidence of the men. The Minister has said that the representatives of the appropriate unions will be consulted before a ship is allowed to go to sea with less than the prescribed complement. But the fact remains that the unions will not have any direct influence on the decision to allow the ship to sail. That is the featureof the Government's  plan to which I take strong exception and to which the men themselves object. Under the administration of the Maritime Industry Commission, regardless of any views to the contrary that the honorable for Evans has expressed, there has been more peace in the shipping industry than there was previously. </para>

                        <para>- I invite the honorable member for McMillan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brown)</inline> to analyse the statistics and ascertain the facts for himself. Since the commission has been in existence, we have not witnessed such incidents as occurred in the days of Walsh and Johnson. This has been due to the fact that the seamen have been represented on the commission and have had confidence in it. The men who go down to the sea know all about the trials and tribulations of their calling, and they realize that their conditions will be threatened by the enactment of this measure. Time will prove whether or not the objections of the Opposition to the Government's proposals are justified. Should events demonstrate that the Government has taken a step in the right direction towards fostering peace in the maritime industry, I shall be happy to give it full credit. However, I am firmly convinced that this provision will remove a bulwark that has given confidence to the seamen on many occasions when ships have gone to sea manned by less than the normal complement. The basis on which we should judge the effectiveness of the commission's administration of the existing act is not the number of occasions on which under-manned ships have gone to sea, but the number of occasions on which ships have carried on without full complements. The facts prove conclusively that the men have had confidence in the decisions of the commission. The Opposition has already expressed its opinion of the first provision in relation to the authorizing of the departure of ships with less than the prescribed complements. It does not propose to delay the committee by calling for divisions on the remaining provisions, but it registers an emphatic protest against them. I am sure that time will prove that our view is correct. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the committee makes a decision on the amendments that I have submitted, <inline font-style="italic">'t</inline> should understand clearly the lengths to' which the Government has gone in order to meet the views expressed by the unions. There are three important provisions in relation to the operation of ships with less than the prescribed complements, and each of them contains a safeguard against the risks that the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison)</inline> apparently has in mind. The unions pointed out to the Government that some ships customarily carried crews in excess of their prescribed complements. They argued that, if such a vessel were allowed to go to sea with four-fifths of the prescribed complement, that strength would represent considerably less than four-fifths of the complement customarily carried. The Government agreed to meet the wishes of the union on that point, and it has drafted an amendment which prescribes that a ship may not be taken to sea unless it carries at least four-fifths of the complement customarily carried. The unions also submitted to the Government that the right to authorize the departure of a vessel with less than its full crew should not be left in the hands of a relatively junior functionary, such as the superintendent at a port of departure. Therefore, the Government agreed to go a stage further and to provide that only a  deputy  director of navigation should have power to authorize the movement of a ship with less than a full, crew. Finally, in order that the union concerned- should be fully aware of the situation in each instance, and should be able to satisfy itself that a genuine effort had" been made to obtain the required number of men, the Government agreed to insert a provision that the assistance of the union should be sought to find additional men. It may be true, as the honorable member for Blaxland has said, that the amendments will not satisfy all the demands of the unions. However, I think the committee will agree that the Government has made a fair and . reasonable effort to satisfy their legitimate requirements. The clause, as proposed to be amended, should be accepted by the committee because it will overcome substantially the objections that were previously raised. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the Government has been extremely sympathetic in drafting the amendments to clause 10 that are now under consideration. Much has been said during the discussions on the various clauses about the conditions that should be laid down for seamen. I consider that' the committee should place on record the fact that probably not much more than 50 per cent, of the so-called seamen, who operate on our coastal ships and are governed by the Navigation Act are really qualified to describe themselves as seamen. They do not know much about seamanship in many ways, hut, both in war and in peace, they have gained great advantages from the fact that they have worked on ships. For example, every seaman who served on a ship trading between two interstate ports during "World War II. was eligible for all the repatriation benefits to which a .man who served <inline font-style="italic">overseas</inline> with the armed forces in a more active capacity was entitled. I can talk with some authority on this subject because I lived on a ship for nearly twelve and a half years, and I have been a member of the British seamen's union. I am probably the only member of the committee who has been a member of that union. I have heard many land-lubbers talking about the provisions of the bill to-night. There is a term, more agricultural than maritime in character, that would appropriately describe their remarks. The amendments now before the committee include a provision that only a deputy director of navigation may authorize the departure of a ship with less than its full complement. Two safeguards are provided. A decision to take the vessel to sea' may be made by its master, but the fina] decision can be made only by the deputy director. All I ask is that every deputy director should be a man who has gone to sea as a master mariner. I believe that there is a tendency in some government departments to appoint men without practical experience to such responsible positions. That criticism applies, I think, in the fields of civil aviation and marine navigation. The Government should be completely adamant that a person who has authority to permit a vessel to go to sea without its full complement must be an ex-master mariner. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister said that the amendments went a long way towards meeting its objections. I know that the union does not approve of the amendments in any way. It did its best to persuade the Government to improve clause 10, but it is dissatisfied with the decision that the Government has now made. I have no objection to the term " land-lubber being applied to me, because I have never been a seafaring man. However, it occurs to me that, when some responsible authority prescribes the proper complement for a ship, it does so with a full knowledge of the requirements of that type of vessel. The decision would be based on the requirements for the safe and efficient working of the vessel. Therefore, the honorable member for Bowman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McColm),</inline> if he has done anything, has supplied a strong reason why the committee should not accept the proposal that a ship should be allowed to go to sea with only four-fifths of its prescribed complement. He has said that, in his opinion - which I do not regard as being authoritative, but which may be used as a basis for argument - over 50 per cent, of the men who go to sea on coastal ships are not qualified seamen. That provides a strong reason why a vessel should not be allowed to leave port with less than its full complement. That appears to h; sound reasoning. - </para>

                <para>If a vessel put. to sea with, only four-  fifths of its complement, the cost to the shipowners of running the vessel would be less than would otherwise be the case. But the Government has not made any proposals about what should be done with money saved in that way. I assume that, if a vessel put to sea with only four-fifths of its complement, the remaining members of the crew, in operating it in an efficient manner, would be required to perform duties for which they  were  not being paid. It seems to be reasonable to suppose that, if the Government desired to help seamen who gp to sea regularly, it would make provision for money saved by shipowners when a ship sails with less than its full complement to be distributed in the form of additional pay to the members of the crew who operate the vessel. </para>
                <para>The Government has said that its intention is to deal with the tactics of the seamen's, union of persuading one or two members of the crew of a vessel to absent themselves when the vessel is due to sail, if the union wants to delay the vessel. To carry out that intention, the Government has proposed a provocative amendment of the law, under which a vessel would be able to put to sea with four-fifths of its complement. If it bo true, as the Minister has asserted, that the seamen's union often deliberately delays a vessel by persuading one or two members of the crew to absent themselves at sailing time, what would the union do to hold up a vessel after this measure, had been passed ? It would not permit a vessel to obtain four-fifths of its complement. If necessary, it would pull the whole of the crew out. Therefore, this amendment of the law will not achieve the desired objective. </para>
                <para>Passengers and crews of coastal vessels are entitled to demand that such vessels shall be operated safely, and that they shall not put to sea without a proper complement. Seamen ought not to be called upon to endanger their lives by going to sea in a vessel that has less than its required complement. I believe that the people who determine the complements of vessels know more about the sea and about the requirements of ships than does either the Minister for </para>
                <para class="block">Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon)</inline> or myself. I accept that they are in a position to determine such matters. When they have determined the complement of a vessel upon the basis of what is required for its safe and efficient working, that determination should not be departed from in any circumstances. If the seamen's union were to declare, as I believe it will do, that its members would not sail in a vessel that had not a full complement, what would the Government do? This matter must be worked out in agreement with the unions to which the men who work the ships belong. I venture to say that this provision will be opposed, not only by members of the seamen's union but also by the general public, which is fully aware that great danger is involved in sailing in a vessel that has less than its prescribed complement. The public is not concerned only with the earning of profits by shipowners. In transport of any kind, the first requirement of members of the public is safety. That is why the general public has always favoured government-operated transport services rather than services operated by private enterprise. The public knows that the first concern of private enterprise is to earn the maximum profits possible, and that the aim of governmentoperated transport services is to provide the best and safest travel facilities. </para>
                <para>No matter what the Minister may say, I am certain that the seamen's union and the other unions concerned with the operations of ships will not regard this proposal as satisfactory and that, in the interests of the safety of their* members and of the travelling public, they will take action to ensure that no vessel shall put to-sea unless it has a full complement. </para>

                    The honorable member for East Sydney
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline>
                    began his speech by saying that he had never been a seafaring man, and by disclaiming any definite knowledge of seafaring matters. He need not have expended his breath upon saying that, because his subsequent remarks made it perfectly obvious, not only that he knew nothing about seafaring matters but also that he had given no attention to the subject-matter of the bill. The honorable member said that the authority which fixes the minimum crew requirements of a "ship does so upon the basis of the safe and efficient working of the ship. That is not the case. The minimum crew is determined upon the basis of the comfort and convenience of the men required to handle a ship at sea day in and day out for long periods. Anybody who has given any thought to the matter knows that the number of men required to handle a ship with efficiency in an emergency is far less than the number of men required to keep the vessel at sea for long periods', without unduly taxing their strength and endurance. The easy and convenient working of a ship in three watches for long periods is the principle factor which determines the number of men that shall be required to sail in it, as well as the number required to do additional work in connexion with passengers, the management of the ship in harbours and matters of that kind. They are the factors which determine the minimum number of hands required in a ship. There is not necessarily any departure from standards of efficiency and safety when a ship sails with less than the number of men ordinarily required to keep it at sea for long periods. "Under the existing legislation, masters are authorized to sail with less than a full complement, provided they have made reasonable attempts to obtain a full complement and have obtained not less than four-fifths. But as we know - and it was conceded even by the honorable member for East Sydney - the crew of a vessel cannot be forced to take it to sea with even only one man short of a full complement, if they do not want to do so. If a ship were one man short of its full complement, and if one member of the crew decided that he did not want to sail with less than the full complement, he could hold the ship up. That flaw in the legislation has been used frequently by the Communist-controlled Seamen's Union to delay ships on the Australian coast.

                    <para>- The commission was established during the war. Therefore, I have not misunderstood the honorable gentleman. He said that there had been less industrial trouble in our ships since the establishment of the Maritime Industry Commission than there was previously. That is entirely wrong. The commission was established in war-time "to deal with a situation that could not be dealt with by the government of the day. The Government could not get ships to sea to carry cargoes round the coast. In such an* emergency, unusual methods were required. The Maritime Industry Commission was established to deal with that situation. Many people believe that it managed to get the ships to sea by making monetary concessions and other concessions which the industry could not afford in normal times. Many people hoped for a return to normal industrial processes as soon as the war was over. The commission, which was established to solve war-time difficulties at any price and by any means, has, in my opinion, been retained for far too long in the post-war period. I welcome wholeheartedly the proposal to abolish it. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Blaxland has often told honorable members of his activities as an opponent of Communists in trade unions. He should welcome any sensible measure designed to curtail the activities of Communists. This is such a measure. It is necessary to overcome the difficulty caused by the fact that a single member of a ship's company can prevent his ship from sailing if the complement of the vessel is one man short at the time of sailing. The Communists in the Seamen's Union of Australasia frequently_use that method of holding ships up. The honorable member for Blaxland appears to believe that some satisfaction can be derived from the absence of industrial trouble in Australian ships. Let me direct his attention to the reply that the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport gave to a question asked by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Keon)</inline> about shipping delays. The reply was given on the 21st October. It set out in detail the number of days on which Australian ships, both privately owned and government owned, had been held up around our coasts. The honorable member will see from that information that there has been an alarming wastage of coastal shipping. </para>
                <para>I do not propose to weary the House by going over the ground that I traversed, in my speech on the second reading of the bill. I remind the honorable member for Blaxland that nothing is more important in the industrial and commercial life oi' this country than that our coastal shipping should move satisfactorily, but there is no sphere of our industrial life in which the Communists have been tackled with less success than in the Seamen's Union of Australasia. I know that the honorable member for Blaxland takes pride in the success of the Australian Labour party groups in trade unions. Will he tell me what success has been achieved by such groups in the Seamen's Union of Australasia? The executive work of the Seamen's Union of Australasia is done through the office of national secretary and secretary in each port. The national secretary is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> V. Elliott, a member of the central committee of the Communist party of Australia. The secretary of the Sydney branch of the union is also a member of the Communist party of Australia, as is the secretary of the Melbourne branch. The secretary of the Fremantle branch of the union is a member of the Western Australian State Committee of the Communist party of Australia. The secretary of the Hobart branch is a member of the Tasmanian State, committee of that party. The secretary of the Adelaide branch is a member of the Communist party of Australia, and a close associate of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> V. Elliott. It is believed, that he was placed in that position by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott.</inline> Curiously enough, the secretary of the Brisbane branch of the union is. not a member, of the Communist party of Australia - he is the- only branch secretary who is not - but he has been very closely associated with his fellow secretaries and. can reasonably be- classed as a- " fellow traveller "'. With that state of affairs, what chance is there of combating communism successfully in the Seamen's Union of Australasia? If the honorable member- for Blaxland were to- turn his mind to the necessity to deal with-. Com.munistinspired delays of Australian ships and look at the situation that, exists in the Seamen's Union of Australasia, perhaps he would be less condemnatory of this measure,, which, to my mind, is a very sensible one. It is designed to combat communism in the Seamen's Union of Australasia. </para>
                <para>The only fault that I can find in the Government's approach to the problem is that the measure will not provide a means to deal with another method adopted by the Communists to delay ships - that is, to deny whole complements to ships. The Parliament and the nation will need to watch very closely the practice of the Communists in the union in denying whole complements to ships. </para>

                    <para>. -  I did not intend to intervene in the debate again, but the idle remarks of the honorable member for Evans  (Mi1.  Osborne) about the branch secretaries of the Seamen's Union of Australasia being members of the Communist party have prompted me to rise to say that what the honorable member does not know about fighting communism, would' fill, not one book, but ten books. There has never been any disagreement between members of the Labour party and members- of the Government parties about dealing with Communists who are traitors to this country. That is about the only thing that we have in common with honorable members opposite. The action of the honorable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne)</inline> in rising in his place here and nominating every Communist leader of the seamen's union leads me to ask him to explain what this bill will" do to improve that situation? If there is one thing that the Government is doing to establish the Communists firmly in control of the seamen's union, it is this very provision. The Government could do nothing that would give a greater fillip to communism in the trade union movement than to place in the hands of the master of every vessel an authority the existence of which can be used by the Communists to make seamen believe that they are. under the lash. That is what  this provision will do. The maritime industry unions formerly had their representatives on the Maritime Industries Commission. Seamen could in those days tell the Communists that they would follow the decisions of the commission on whether or not a ship would sail, and not be misled by the Communists. The fact that the decision on whether or not a ship should sail with four-fifths of its crew is to be the responsibility of the master will enable the Communists to cause unrest among the crews of ships whose masters decide to sail under those circumstances. I do not know of any provision that has ever come before this chamber that has given Communist leaders in any trade union greater help than this provision will give Communist agitators and the Communist leaders of the Seamen's Union of Australasia. As far as I can see it is not the intention of the bill to take the control of the Seamen's Union of Australasia away from the Communists.Such action will be left to honorable members on this side of the chamber and to the people who fight communism in the trade unions themselves. The bill will be a lever that the Communists will be able to use against the elements in the trade unions that are opposed to them. If the honorable member for Evans were to work in the trade union movement for a few years he would know more about it and would not make such stupid statements as he has made. </para>

                        <para>. - I note that the draft amendment providing for the omission of sub-section (8.) of the proposed new section 45a provides that a superintendent " shall " refuse to employ a person as a seaman under certain circumstances. I am pleased to note that the word "shall" has been altered to " may ". One of the points to which the Opposition took strong exception during the second-reading stage was the fact that that provision was to be mandatory. We are pleased that it is now to be a discretionary power. One of the reasons why the Opposition has been so much concerned about the provision in relation to bad discharges received by seamen was that until the amendment was altered, a marine superintendent had no power to give employment to a man who had had three bad discharges within a period of five years. Under the altered amendment a superintendent is to have discretionary power. We appreciate even that small alteration. However, the position remains bad enough because a seaman may be branded as a result of having received three bad discharges. He might have received his first bad discharge at, say, the end of 1947, the second had discharge early in the following year, and the third during the last six months. Until the amendment was introduced, it was mandatory on a superintendent to refuse to give such a man employment in the industry. An honorable member said earlier in the debate that a man who had received a bad discharge had a right to appeal, against it. Such a man will have, in fact, no right to appeal against "a single discharge, as far as I can ascertain, until he has received a total of three bad discharges. He will have no right to appeal against the first or second bad discharge at the time he receives it. Only when he has received the third bad discharge, and has been refused employment, will he have a right to appeal to a single judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and then he must try to prove that a bad discharge that he received, perhaps almost . five  years before, was not merited. Do honorable members really grasp the situation? An employee will be obliged to wait until the final charge has been made against him, and he has no longer the right to work at his job, before he may appeal against the original charge. Such a provision is unique. The Minister may reply, with complete justification, that this condition was laid down by the Stevedoring Industry Commission. That is true. I am not making my submissions on behalf of the Communists. I am speaking for the genuine man who may " slip ". He will not have the right to appeal against his first bad discharge until he has received his third bad discharge, and has been suspended from employment in theindustry. The adoption of the word may " in lieu of " shall " will render the position a little easier for him. </para>

                <para>I strongly oppose the bill because it provides, first of all, the dictum to be followed by the judge who will hear the appeal. In no other industry is an appellate authority directed by legislation. Honorable members opposite refer from time to time to the employment of </para>
                <para class="block">Communists in the Public Service. I wonder what the reaction of public servants "would be if they were deprived of their appeals tribunal? A seaman who has three bad discharges will appear before a single judge and will not be supplied with a copy of the reasons why he was given his first bad discharge five years earlier. His discharge is simply marked, and goes into the records. Later, I shall refer to what happens in the records. </para>

                    <para>.- I shall make two points briefly. I discussed one of them earlier. I do not believe that this clause goes far enough. The honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison)</inline> considers that the clause could bring about an injustice. Once again, some one who knows nothing in particular about the work of seamen in general is trying to tell us that a man might get three bad discharges simply because he has been unfortunate. I am prepared to admit that a man might, get one bad discharge as the result of being unfortunate, but he certainly would not get three bad discharges for that reason. I also consider that a man who refuses to join three ships in .succession should be suspended from his employment in the industry for at least one year. This persistent refusal by directed individuals, to a large degree, to take ships to sea is one of the greatest threats to our economy by the Seamen's Union of Australasia, I can understand why a man is prepared not to accept a particular ship, or, perhaps, a second ship, but his refusal to accept three ships in succession is .nothing but deliberate sabotage to our coastal trade. Any man who aims to sabotage our trade should be .suspended from, the industry for at least a year. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The second matter to which I shall refer relates to discharges. I do not believe that the single sheet system of discharge now in use is satisfactory, because it leaves the way open for a certain amount of abuse. "We have heard it said that, under this amendment, a man who has three bad discharges in five years is liable to certain penalties. When his discharges are given to him on single sheets of paper, there is no reason why he would have to produce three bad discharges. Australia should adopt the system in operation in most other countries, and provide for a seaman's discharges to be recorded in a book. He may do away with one discharge, should he so desire, but he could not dispose of his discharge book containing a continuous record of his service in the industry. I do not believe that a genuine trade unionist would object to my proposal. The single-sheet system of discharge now in use is not in the best interest of the seamen themselves. The book system shows clearly a seaman's continuous record of service, and does not lay itself open to abuse as does the single-sheet system.. </para>

                    <para>.- The Opposition does not put up any case for an employee who would not be acting in a reasonable manner. Whilst I do not claim to be completely <inline font-style="italic">au fait</inline> with what the honorable member for Bowman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McColm)</inline> has put forward, his proposal seems to have some merit in regard to determining the exact record of a seaman in the industry. The real danger which I see, from the viewpoint of Labour and the trade unions, is in regard to the offences a seaman commits which oblige the master of a ship or the superintendent to give him a bad discharge. It occurs to me that this provision could be used to coerce members of the Seamen's Union of Australasia who were carrying out a direction of their trade union. If, as the result of an industrial dispute, they were' asked by their trade union not to report to their ship, this provision could mean that the seamen would receive bad discharges. </para>

                <para>As a trade unionist who always upholds the.right of the unions to take direct action to hold up a ship or a job if they have tried every other means to get something which they regard as a grievance rectified, I am not favorably disposed towards this provision. If it is not the intention of the Government to interfere with what we regard as the legitimate right of the trade union to direct its members on certain occasions, the provision should be amended in order to state specifically that it shall not apply in such circumstances. The trade union movement generally would resist an attempt by any government to impose such a form of coercion or control upon industrial organizations. If. the Seamen's Union of Australasia had some matter which it regarded as a real grievance, and tried to get it rectified by every means, and finally decided to direct its members not to report for work, those men should not be penalized by being given bad discharges. That is my view. Members of the Opposition do not consider that any employee, regardless of the industry in which he is engaged, should be the sole judge of his conduct in the industry. He has to act in a reasonable manner. We do not believe that a man should go in an intoxicated condition aboard ship or on to a job when he is obliged to report to work. But I repeat that men who are rightly and properly carrying out the direction of their union should not be penalized by being given bad discharges. </para>

The  present section of the principal act gives effect to a recommendation of the International Labour Office that wages shall he paid for every day a seaman is unemployed, up to two months. A shipowner is relieved from his liability if he ?an offer the seamen employment. During the war, the Maritime Industry Commission made an order guaranteeing seamen in addition to the benefits of this section, wages until they were brought home, and then one month's wages. That was an encouragement to seamen to offer for work immediately, and this amendment will continue the concession. </para>

                <para class="block">I suggest that this clause should be rejected by the committee because the addition of the words " hurt or injury " is not justified. We should consider this matter not from the viewpoint of the landlubber, but from that of the seaman. During the working of a ship at sea occasions arise when seamen have to risk their lives and limbs in sudden emergencies. They cannot wait to read or consider the regulations about what they shall do and what they shall not do. They must act immediately in the interests of the safety of the ship. I agree that if illness is wrongfully caused, the master should not be required to pay wages, but I do not agree that if hurt or injury is caused by the "default" of the seaman he  i3  not entitled to his wages. The word " default " may be interpreted in many different ways, and a man who acted in the interests of the ship but nevertheless " defaulted " might he deprived of his proper payment. The committee should respect this clause. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been assured by those who have some expert knowledge of this matter that the provision is regarded as necessary. Just as in the armed services occasionally people are found who inflict wounds upon themselves to avoid the execution of lawful ' commands or the carrying out of lawful duties, so the same thing may be found occurring at sea. It appears to be unreasonable that a shipowner or employer should be expected to pay wages to a man who has wilfully or by his own default inflicted some hurt or injury upon himself. The Opposition apparently recognizes the validity of the clause in respect of " illness " and it is difficult to foresee why the same logic that has been applied to " illness " should not be applied to " hurt or injury ". The provision has been inserted because of difficulties that have occurred in the past, and it springs from the experience of expert officers of the Government. I do not feel disposed to accept the invitation of the Opposition to omit this provision. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister knows industry well enough to know that the word " default " can be applied very widely. Tinder the clause any master who wanted to take advantage of an emergency situation could do so. Seamen have to break regulations in times of emergency because the safety of the ship is at stake. In those circumstances surely they are entitled to payment. If a provision of this nature were to be applied to railway workers I would certainly oppose it, and so I must oppose it even more strongly when it is applied to seamen. Masters should not be given the opportunity to take advantage of the actions of seamen during emergencies. I suggest that the committee should not accept the provision. </para>

                    <para>. - Under this clause, it is proposed to double the penalty of a fine of £20 to £40 in respect of offences against discipline. A fine of £20 should be regarded as the maximum penalty that should be imposed upon a worker for an industrial offence. The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> has not offered any reason for the proposal to double this penalty. Apparently, the Government decided upon a fine of £40 as a shot in the dark. The proposal would not be so bad if the penalty were to be a fine to be imposed in the ordinary way. This clause also provides that in certain circumstances  a  worker who offends against discipline may be penalized by having a proportion of his wages stopped. The Australian Labour Party will never countenance the provision of a penalty in the form of a deduction of wages, and such a provision should never be tolerated in any civilized community. I invite the Minister to inform the committee of the reasons that actuated the Government in proposing this provision. </para>

                    <para>. -  There is nothing novel about this provision. Indeed, it has been allowed to remain in the principal act since 1912 and has been supported by all Governments in thisParliament, regardless of party, during that period. It is now proposed to double a fine that has stood unaltered since 1912. The fine has not even been increased in proportion to the depreciation that has occurred in the value of money during that period. I also point out that this penalty is applied in respect of the very serious offence of desertion from a ship. In 1912, the penalty by way of a deduction from wages that could be exacted for such an offencewas £20 which in those days would be the equivalent of a seaman's wages for a period of one and a half months, whereas to-day, the equivalent of wages in respect of such a period would be about £75. Therefore, although it is proposed to double the finefrom £20 to £40, the amount, as a degree of exaction, will still be only half of that for which provision was made in 1912. No reasonable person could take objection to this proposal. </para>

In that event would the Government be prepared to reduce this penalty proportionately?

A fine cannot be collected under the terms of the act as it stands until the superintendent has had time to consider the matter. The principle upon which the present provision is based should not be varied.A fine should not be collected until the matter has been considered by the superintendent. Should the superintendent decide that a fine has not been rightly imposed, under the terms of the proposed new section, the superintendent will be required to recover it from the master of the ship and repay it to the seaman.

                    <para>. - I am assured that the clause generally involves no substantial departure from the present provisions of the act. The procedure is merely set out a little more clearly in the proposed new section. The Maritime Industry Commission, on which the unions are represented, has adopted the practice for which the clause provides. Under clause 12, power is given to make regulations in relation to the time at which a penalty may be deducted from wages. The committee can safely accept my assurance that past practices will be substantially followed in relation to this matter. </para>

                    <para>. - This provision is designed solely for the benefit of seamen. At present, the only seamen entitled to the benefit of section 132 are  those left ashore in any manner authorized by law. Therefore, if a shipmaster breaks the law by failing to carry out all his obligations under the act-for example, by failing to discharge a sick seaman before a superintendent - the seaman concerned is technically not entitled to the benefit of the section. Such a case occurred some years ago, but the shipowner did 1101; disclaim his liability. The omission of the words, " in any manner authorized by law ", will remove any possibility of injustice being done to seamen under the provisions of the section. The remainder of the clause also will extend the scope of the protection afforded to seamen. </para>

                        <para>- It does not do so. If anything, the clause will make the existing situation even worse. The Minister said in his second-reading speech that, in the appointment of the committee, due consideration would be given to the employees. However, the amendment provides that the committee shall consist, in addition to the  chairman,  of not less than two members to represent the owners of ships and the same number of members to represent masters, officers and seamen. I do not think that the present Minister would take advantage of the provision, but I know of other Ministers who would do so in order to appoint two representatives of the shipowners and two masters, and thus exclude the seamen. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know why the honorable member should be afraid of it. Why should not entries in a log-book be accepted as evidence? Surely there could not be much more reliable evidence than the written comment of the master of a vessel as it appeared in the log-book of the vessel. I should think that such an entry would be much more reliable evidence of an incident than the recollection of the persons concerned in it. Logbook entries have been accepted in the past as evidence in other courts. Why, in the name of reason, should not they be accepted in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court? </para>

                    <para>.- I can see many grounds for objecting to the amendment.The definition of a deserter has been amended, and is much wider than it was. It now covers persons who previously would not have been regarded as having committed such a serious crime as desertion. As I understand the amendment, it would be an offence for the family of a seaman who had been declared to be a deserter to permit him to remain in their home. It would be a most serious action to penalize the parents of a young man who had been declared to be a deserter from a ship if they gave him shelter in their home. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The amendment is loosely drafted, but, as I understand the' matter, that is the implication of it. The Opposition could not agree in any circumstances to a provision that would penalize parents who gave shelter to a son, or a wife who gave shelter to her husband. Proposed new section 387b states that a person shall not wilfully harbour or secrete a seaman or apprentice who has deserted his ship, failed to join his ship, or absented himself from his ship in wilful disobedience of a lawful command of the master or of an officer of the ship. </para>

                        <para>- They might not know that he had been classified as a deserter. Under this measure, it would be a very simple matter for a seaman to be classified as a deserter, although there was some legitimate reason for his failure to join his ship. It could take a considerable time for him to prove that he was not guilty of desertion. In the meantime, his parents would be liable to a fine if they gave him shelter. In my opinion, this amendment represents an invasion of the privacy of the home. I suggest that the amendment be withdrawn and redrafted in such a way as to remove this objectionable provision. </para>

That section stated that no person should, by any means whatever, persuade a seaman or apprentice to commit any breach of his agreement, or wilfully harbour or secrete a seaman or apprentice who had deserted from or wilfully failed to join his ship. The penalty for a breach of the provisions of the section was a fine of £20. This amendment proposes that any person who harbours a man who has failed - not wilfully failed - to join his ship, shall be liable to a fine of £20. The word "wilfully" has been omitted. The definition of desertion has been widened to such a degree that many difficulties could arise.

                    <para>. - Much of what has been said in criticism of proposed new section 387b is not justified by the facts. The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> has said that the Opposition would object strongly to any provision that would enable action to be taken against parents who harboured a son who had deserted from his ship. A provision of this kind has been in the act for a long time, including periods of office of Labour governments. I have not heard of any injustice being caused by it,- or of any serious trouble arising from it. The amendment relates to a person who wilfully harbours orsecretes a seaman or apprentice. It is quite clear, having regard to the use of the word " wilfully ", that the provision will apply only to persons who harbour or secrete a seaman or apprentice, knowing that they should not do so. In that event, it would be proper that a penalty should be imposed upon them.. It is not a considerable penalty by modern standards. I do not believe that the objections that have been raised are sufficiently strong to warrant an alteration of the wording of the proposed new. section at this stage. </para>

                <para class="block">I ask the Minister whether that provision would not mean that a trade union official who was merely carrying out his function by conveying a majority decision of the union to some of its members would not be taking action that might, in the view of legal authorities,- involve him in a charge of inciting a breach of the agreement, although, in the view of the union, he would be merely giving a legitimate direction to its members. It would appear to me that the proposed new provision would mean that the union officer might be penalized in such cases. I think, as a trade unionist and a member of the Labour party, that this is a principle to which we cannot accede, because we refuse to accept the argument that members of a trade union should sacrifice their right to strike. We have always said, and we believe, as members of the Labour party, that no trade union ought to strike while there is any other avenue available to it for the rectification of grievances, but unionists who have unsuccessfully explored all the existing facilities for rectification of grievances, should not be deprived of the right to strike. We refuse to surrender the right of the trade unionist to withhold his labour in order to have grievances corrected. Honorable members on the Government side have supported the actions of other sections of the community in withholding their products from the market because they were dissatisfied with the prices offered. Workers who sell their labour, which is their only product, are entitled to withhold it if they are dissatisfied with their wages or conditions. Therefore, we strongly object to this additional provision to penalize trade union officials being inserted in the legislation. </para>

                        <para>- That is a matter of opinion. As it stood originally in the bill, the offence concerned was to be indictable and punishable by a term of imprisonment. We heeded objections to that provision, and decided to bring it into line with similar provisions in other industrial awards made by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. In other words, we are prepared to agree that conditions that now apply to other industries, and that have been adopted under legislation passed by this Parliament, shall apply to the same degree and with the same maximum penalty to classes of offences committed in relation to seamen. The honorable member for East Sydney contends that provision will represent an intrusion on the right to strike. He is entitled to his opinion on that matter, and - I shall not argue the proposition in detail at this late hour. For the information of the committee, however, I say that this amendment will bring seamen, into line with persons employed in other sections of industry. </para>

                    <para>. -  My experience in arbitration courts enables me to say that every document that comes before such courts has to be proved in its own right. This clause seeks to alter the onus of proof in respect of documents that come before a single judge of the court. I know that the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> is a legal man who has a wide knowledge of industrial arbitration and I cannot understand how, having made the admissions that he made earlier, he can accept this amendment.

                        <para>- I have not got it all wrong. I have it exactly right. This provision will completely shift the onus of proof in respect of documents, and will cut completely across principles that have been in force in industrial arbitration matters ever since 1904. This is one principle that the Opposition will not accept. If honorable members on the other side of the chamber appreciated just what this provision means, having regard to the previous decision about the admissibility of documents which has been passed, and to the admission of the Minister, they would not readily accept it either. The committee has already adopted the provision that a certain document shall be admitted by the court, and the onus of proof is now to be passed on to people other than those who produce the copy of the document to prove that the copy is not a genuine copy. I think that the Minister will agree that this is something that has never been attempted before in industrial arbitration legislation, and it should not be attempted now. The party, whether employer or trade union, which submits a document to the court, should have to prove beyond a shadow of doubt that it is a true copy of the original, and the person who signed the certificate should be called as a witness so that he may be cross-examined before the court on whether or not he signed it. I put it to the Minister that this provision should not be persisted in, and that the proof in relation to documents that come before a judge should rest squarely on the shoulders of the parties that produce them. </para>

James Harrison)</inline> is now becoming completely captious in the sort of criticism that he is offering. This clause has been inserted because ships' documents cannot always be readily produced to a court, as honorable members will realize. Quite clearly, a ship away from port cannot always make its log-books available to a court, and so provision is made for the production of a certified copy or extract of such documents, and their -admissibility as evidence. Before the document can be accepted it lias to be certified by a proper authority. </para>

                    <para>. -  This clause deals with industrial matters and the functions of the court. Proposed new section 405a in the main repeats the principles on which the Commonwealth Arbitration Court operates. The Minister might be able to tell me what the position will be when a dispute arises in respect of an industry that operates in only one State. I have in mind as an illustration a dispute that occurred in the sugar industry not long ago at Cairns, but did not extend even as far as Townsville or Mackay in the same State. It occurred as a consequence of the disinclination of shipowners and others to adopt principles that have already been accepted in the two other ports that I have mentioned. It occurs to me that having regard to the interstate flavour of all industrial disputes handled by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, an attempt by a single judge to intervene in a case of that description may be contrary to the principles laid down by that tribunal. Frankly, I do not know the answer to the problem. I have had great difficulty on many occasions, when I have appeared before a conciliation commissioner or the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, in stretching a dispute that existed in one State in order to satisfy the court that it had an interstate flavour. I have in mind the Queensland railway dispute, which occurred about two years ago. A settlement, could not be obtained from the State industrial tribunal. New South "Wales railway employees were taking trains from that State into Queensland, and were actually coming into contact with the Queensland railway employees, who were on strike. Yet my request that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court should intervene in .the dispute was rejected, because I was unable to prove that an interstate dispute existed. Every member of the Australian Railways Union and the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen was on strike, and we desired to bring the last named organization into the dispute. We endeavoured to convince the court that the dispute was likely to spread to New South Wales overnight, but the tribunal refused, under its charter, to intervene in the matter. I invite the Minister to explain the position that will arise if a dispute occurs at only one port in Queensland from which sugar is shipped-. Having regard to the numerous decisions that have been given on matters of this kind, I doubt whether a single judge of the court will have power to deal with the situation. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The second matter that I raise related to appeals. I hope that the Minister will explain this provision, because it has not yet been explained satisfactorily to date. An appeal may come before the Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court from an employer or a union to have  a matter dealt with by the Full Court. Why does the Government propose to restrict the scope of action of the Chief Judge to one of public interest? Obviously, many matters will arise, if an appeal has any merit at all, that cannot be related to public interest. If the Government believes that the Chief Judge has the understanding of the industrial movement that I believe he possesses, why does it insist upon restricting his scope to one of public interest? Surely we can trust the Chief Judge to determine these matters. He has the capacity to understand whether an appeal is in the public interest, and to say "Yea" or "Nay". Why should he not be permitted to determine whether the subject that comes before him should be accepted or rejected in the public interest, or whether it should be dealt with purely as an industrial matter? I should like the Minister to give the reasons for this restriction of the scope of the Chief Judge's authority. </para>

I can only say that I am most interested to hear this suggestion from him, because, as honorable members will recall, when the Government introduced this provision for an appeal system, strong criticism was voiced by honorable members opposite, who resisted it most strenuously. In fact, we restricted the scope of the appeal provision in order to meet, in part, the kind of objection which members of the Labour party raised at that time. We wanted them to see how useful this provision could be, and it is encouraging to know that the value of those amendments has been recognized by the Labour party. I shall carefully examine the honorable member's suggestion. It may represent an improvement as a result of the experience we have now had of the functioning of that legislation. </para>

                <para>The scope of the jurisdiction of the Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration will be no wider and, for that matter, no narrower than is the scope of the arbitration power and industrial power of the Commonwealth. The clause now under consideration will introduce a new part into the act which will -provide that a single judge of the court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine industrial disputes and matters relating to the terms and conditions of employment of seamen so far as the authority of the Commonwealth extends. The jurisdiction includes the settlement of industrial disputes which extend beyond the limits of one State, and the determination of industrial matters relating to interstate and overseas trade and commerce. Whatever limitation may exist in the hypothetical case put forward by the honorable member is neither narrowed nor widened as the result of this provision. The hill excludes the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration under the act, but provides for an appeal to the Full Arbitration Court upon the same conditions as an appeal lies from conciliation commissioners to the Full Court. That is where the Chief Judge is of the opinion that the matter is of such importance as to justify the granting of leave to appeal. Provision is also made, as in the act, whereby the judge  may refer to the Full Court matters arising before him which, in the public interest, should be dealt with by the Full Court. This vesting of industrial jurisdiction in a judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration is in line with the corresponding provisions of the Stevedoring Industry Act. </para>

                    <para>. - This bill is very complicated, and the difficulties associated with the consideration of it have been enhanced by the fact that consultation with the trade unions have been delayed, with the result that amendments have been left to a very late stage. Some of the amendments that have been made to the bill represent definite concessions to the views put forward by the Opposition. I am deeply indebted to the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison)</inline> and the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> for having put forward the Opposition's case, and to the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> for his courtesy. However, the bill remains very objectionable to us in many respects, and, therefore, we shall oppose the motion for the third reading. </para>

                    <para>. - The Opposition's only interest in this bill is to ensure that there should be expedition with complete safety in the handling of explosives. We suggested that the Government should seek cooperation with the State authorities that deal with similar matters. As the Ministed pointed out during the committee stages of the bill, he has been in consultation with port authorities and that they, with some exceptions, were agreeable to our proposals. The Minister indicated yesterday that his colleague in another place proposed to introduce the amendments. The amendments seem to be reasonable, and to give effect to the principles that the Opposition enunciated yesterday. The Minister's consultation might more properly have been made with State governments or the State ministers who control explosives. However, perhaps the conclusion reached would have been the same because the Minister has consulted with State port authorities who have apparently put forward the same views as State ministers would have put forward. The Opposition accepts the amendments. </para>

What date and hour are to be fixed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker?</inline> I should appreciate it if the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> would answer that question. Will it be in March, February or January ? I have no doubt that the Ides of March will come to this Government, but I am thinking of March, February, or January of 1953. </para>

                    <para>As the House will now adjourn until after Christmas it is fitting that I should make some acknowledgments. We are adjourning at the end of a year of very long sittings. The amount of work that has been done by honorable . members of both sides of the House, during this year's sittings, has been quite remarkable. One pays no undue attention to figures, but in the course of this year's sittings the House has dealt with no less than 109 bills. As the yearly average since the inception of federation is 53 bills, it will be seen that this has been a very heavy legislative programme. This year's sittings have also been quite remarkable for the fact that in the course of them we have lost no  less  than four colleagues from this Parliament - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes, Mr. Lazzarini, Mr. Eggins,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> - all of whom were very well known and all of whom have been spoken about with feeling by honorable members. </para>
                    <para>I offer the thanks of the House to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> to the  Chairman  of Committees, the Temporary Chairmen of Committees, the Clerks of the House, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, the officials of the House generally and the press for their usual services to this Parliament. I desire to add a particular word to those who have managed the refreshment-rooms and who have served honorable members in that way. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-style="italic">De mortuis nil nisi bonum!</inline> I should like to say that this year in the Parliament we have had what was, I think on the whole, a novel departure. One of my colleagues, the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eric J. Harrison)</inline> has been Leader of the House, and the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> as  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, has been his opposite number, for the purpose of organizing the business of the House. All of us who have experience of this place know that if the work is to be got through with the minimum, or maximum - I am never too sure which it is - number of closures, with a trifle of " guillotine " thrown in occasionally - but all with mutual goodwill and understanding - it is important to have a sensible arrangement between both sides of the House. I thank the Vice-President of the Executive Council and the honorable member for Melbourne for the useful and friendly co-operation that they have shown in this matter. It is quite true that when the axe- has fallen, there have been threats uttered from the other side; but those of us on this side of the chamber, who are a little long in the tooth, seem to remember that we ourselves protested more violently in our day in Opposition. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret having to delay the House at this hour, but if it had not been for the action of the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eric J. Harrison)</inline> in gagging the debate on the motion for the adjournment so often in recent weeks, I should not have been impelled to rise at this juncture. I direct the attention of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to the case of an ex-serviceman, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Young,,</inline> who, it is alleged, failed to disclose to the Repatriation Department the full value, of the assets that had been held by his wife and himself, and who was proceeded against by the department recently and compelled to pay to that department the  sum of £608 15s. lOd. This ex-serviceman is nearly 70 years of age. He has no worldly possessions in his own right. All the assets that I have mentioned belong to the wife.  His  wife had been bequeathed by her father 334 shares in the firm of Tooth and Company Limited. ' She was a very dominant woman, and insisted that the shares belonged .to her solely. Indeed, she adopted so obstinate an attitude in the matter, that in a will which she made in 1946 she bequeathed the shares not to her husband but to her niece and nephew. In October of last year, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Young</inline> applied for an age pension at the age of 63 years. She had not applied for an age pension when she reached the age of 60 years because she had been informed that she could not qualify for a pension because she possessed the shares that I have mentioned. However, on making .inquiries through the Department of Social Services she was informed that it was not the market value, which was considerably higher, but the face value of the shares that was taken into account in computing her means. She then applied for an age pension. The Repatriation Department then discovered that in 1945 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Young</inline> had failed to disclose that his wife held these shares at that time and it contended that he must repay an amount of £608 15s. lOd. that he had received in pension. The department failed to give details of its calculation of that sum. This man has been deprived of a repatriation pension since he returned from World War I., although he has been an invalid for the greater part of the intervening period. Prom 1920 to 1948 he was under medical treatment for a neurotic complaint. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>This couple has been obliged to live on an income of only £.150 a year. In April of this year I wrote to the Repatriation Department and requested that it give consideration to the restoration of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Young's</inline> pension at the rate of £2 ls. 3d. a week which had been suspended in October. The  Deputy  Commissioner .replied acknowledging my representations. When .1 was obliged to write again to the department in June of this year seeking further information, the department promised that it would furnish such information. However, I heard nothing further about the matter until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Young</inline> himself came to me and showed me three summonses that the department had issued against him for the recovery of the sum -that I have mentioned. Since 1945 this ex-serviceman had received a pension at the rate of only £2 ls. 3d. a fortnight, or approximately £53 a year, and his wife since 1951 had received a pension at the rate of £1 19s. 3d. a fortnight, making their combined income from pension £104 a year, plus a sum of £50 which the wife received as dividend in respect of the brewery shares. Their combined income is approximately £212 less than the combined pension which they should be receiving to-day. In view of that fact will the Prime Minister give consideration to restoring <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Young's</inline> pension to him. This couple has paid the sum of £608 that the Repatriation Department demanded. I urge the Prime Minister to see that the pensions to which this couple are entitled are restored to them and also that an examination be made to ascertain how the Repatriation Department arrived at the sum which it claimed from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Young.</inline> I ask the right honorable gentleman to give consideration also to the possibility that the pensions were not paid to this couple at correct rates. The only people who, it can be said, have been defrauded in this instance have been <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. and Mrs. Young,</inline> because they received only £1,142 for the sale of their Tooth and Company Limited shares and, at the same time, they have paid to the Repatriation Department the sum of £608 15s. lOd. Had they been allowed to spend the value of the shares at the rate of £3 a week each during the years from 1945 to the present time, they would have been better off financially. I appeal to the Prime Minister to have an inquiry made with a view to the restoration of the pensions to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. and Mrs. Young</inline> and also the restoration of a percentage of the sum of £608 in order to enable them to enjoy some degree of comfort instead of being obliged to live on the breadline. </para>

                        <para>. - Some months ago the Foreign Affairs Committee, which is composed entirely of Government members, recommended in  a  report that it furnished to the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> be asked to examine the joint declaration of the preparatory peace conference at Peking with a view to ascertaining whether certain Australians in signing that declaration had been guilty of sedition, or treason. On the 8th October, I asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he would recognize that the continued lack of action on that report or of an announcement in respect of the matter perpetuated a smear on several Australians, one of whom was  a  constituent of mine. The Minister replied that the Attorney-General had not yet reported to him on the matter and that he, himself, would discuss it with his colleague in order to see whether he could supply further information at an early date. It is absolutely wrong that the Parliament should go into recess and allow this threat to hang over the heads of these Australian citizens. The Minister for External Affairs should take action immediately to clarify this matter. </para>

Archie Cameron). -  I thank the Clerks, the Serjeant-at-Arms, the chamber attendants, and the members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff for the services that they have given me during this year. I am also deeply indebted to the party Whips for their kindly, though unobtrusive co-operation. Only on seldom occasions was I furnished with a list of projected speakers which was not altered within a period of a few minutes. However, such incidents added to the variety of the situation in which I am placed. I am also indebted to all other officers of the House, including the members of the staffs of the Library and of the refreshment rooms for the services that they have given to the Parliament during the year. I take this opportunity, although it may be somewhat premature to do so, to wish all honorable members a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. This sessional period has been happier for me for the reason that I have been relieved of the responsibility of naming any honorable member and ejecting him from the House. </para>

It accordingly increased age and invalid pensions at a cost of £8,500,000 a year and granted increases in widows' pensions and unemployment and sickness benefits, bringing the total additional cost up to £11,000,000 a year. Labour governments between July, 1943, and December, 1949, evidently took a similar view. The matter will, however, be kept closely under notice. </para>

                            <para>The Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Savings Bank finance co-operative housing societies subject to the condition that the lender has the right to vary the rate of interest charged at any time. The increase to 4i per cent, per annum in the interest rate for such lending was made in conjunction with the general increase in overdraft rates as from the 1st August, 1952. It is understood that the other main lender to housing societies, namely, the State Savings Bank of Victoria, charges the same rate of interest. 4i per cent, per annum, for both existing and new societies. Some other lenders to housing societies may have made loans on the basis of the interest rate being fixed at the inception of the loan and not subject to variation, and some such loans are possibly still carrying a rate of 35 per cent. The private banks are undertaking a small proportion only of this type of lending and it is not known what rate of interest they are charging on new loans.  2 and 3. This matter falls within the field of responsibility of the Commonwealth Bank. It is relevant topoint out, however, that the Commonwealth Bank's general overdraft  Tate  is 43/4 per cent., per annum as against the general rate of 5 per cent, applied by private banks, and that the bank makes  a  further concession in lending to co-operative housing societies at 41/2 per cent, per annum. </para>

Air Force - two (both motor cycle accidents when proceeding between home and place of duty). Army - no national service trainees have lost their lives as a result of accidents whilst undergoing training. However, four have died as a result of accidents whilst on leave. (6) Navy - 35 (including one whose "prior to entry" disability recurred). Air Force - ninecases involving payment of compensation have been reported. There may have been others not regarded as serious enough to report and not involving compensation, e.g., no loss of civilian earnings. Army  -  162 national service trainees have suffered accidents which have resulted in compensation being approved, under the provisions of the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act. There have been other injuries such as fractures, cuts, abrasions and sprains which have necessitated hospitalization or treatment at unit regimental aid posts, but which have not involved compensation. (c) Navy - nil. Air Force - nil. Army - two. (d) Navy - one trainee has been discharged as medically unfit as a result of illness contracted during his training and two others were discharged owing to illnesses present prior to entry. Air Force  -  24 trainees have been discharged medically unfit for service. All of these were discharged on account of disabilities which existed prior to their entry. Army - 97 national service trainees have been discharged as medically unfit as a result of being medically boarded for a variety of reasons. (Not all of these would have been discharged as the result of illness occurring during training.) </para>

Those instructions related to all literature (books, pamphlets, &amp;c.)~, posters and press and other advertising media. There are at present only four publications being distributed and those that were withdrawn are to be replaced by loose-leaf folders comprising a series of fact pamphlets, each relating to a specific subject, e,g., employment, social service benefits, accommodation, &amp;c. This will mean that in the event of any one subject becoming out of date that pamphlet alone need be withdrawn, leaving the greater part of the publicity still available for continued distribution.

                        <para>Ice-cooled insulated vans are at present in use on the Central Australia Railway for the conveyance of perishable goods. Three vans run from Terowie on the South Australian system loaded with fruit, vegetables, small goods, &amp;c, and one van is used to convey mainly kegged beer from Port Augusta. Meat, butter and smallgoods, <inline font-style="italic">te.,</inline> for stations Quorn to Oodnadatta are carried in portable iceboxes. Perishables for consignees at the Leigh Creek . coal-field are conveyed by a South Australian railways ice-cooled van twice weekly from Fort Pirie to Telford via Peterborough and Quorn. These services are adequate for the amount of traffic offering and the vans and ice-boxes arrive at their destinations with enough ice to ensure satisfactory preservation of their contents. It is realized, of course, that mechanically refrigerated cars would provide a better standard of service and the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner is examining this proposal to determine whether the traffic offering could justify the expense of providing vans of this type.  His  inquiries are not yet complete but the honorable member may be assured that if the provision of such vans is found to be warranted they will be provided in due course. </para>

                        <para>The question of the future standardization of various railway systems and the order of priority is a matter that is under active consideration from time to time. A decision for any extension of standardization depends on the availability of finance, men and materials and loan market prospects. The only decisions made so far are Stirling North to Leigh Creek coal-field and 158 miles from Wolseley to Mount Gambier under railway standardization scheme. </para>

                        <para>- The answers to the honorable member's questions are as follows : -  1 It is not practicable to determine the exact number of distillers in each State, as the number varies greatly from time to time, but it is estimated that there would be between 200 to 300 field distillers actively engaged in the whole of Australia at the present time. During a peak period, such as was experienced about twelve months ago, this number would probably rise to about 3,000. </para>

                            <para>Production statistics since 104-1 are not available through the Commonwealth Statistician, as State returns have not been fully complete in details. However, the production position, as ascertained from State sources, is that there is no eucalyptus oil produced in Tasmania or Western Australia. During the 1048 and 1049 periods a few tons of oil were produced in Queensland but production there is now negligible. The figures for the other States are as follows: - </para>

(a) Australian consumption for the three years 1948-1950 averaged 94,884 gallons. (6) Exports for the five years ending 1951, averaged 129,500 gallons. 4. (a-) The price received by the distillers for oil varies according to the typo of oil distilled and, up till late in 1949, when price fixing was lifted, the prices were as follows: - ls. 9d.-3s. Gd. per lb. for medicinal iil; 2s. ld.- 2s. 2d. per lb. for industrial oil; 6s. 6d.-25s. per lb. for perfumery oil. Since that period the price has been subject to great fluctuations and for medicinal oils the price, at times, has reached 6s. 9d'. per lb., and for industrial oils has reached 7e. per lb. (6) the average export price for oil in 1947-48 was 4s. 4.4d. per lb. and for 1948-49 was 3s. 7.4d. per lb., but, as there is no means of determining how much of this export oil was medicinal and how much was industrial, no average price for industrial or medicinal oil can be estimated. </para>

                            <para>No. As a matter of general policy, the Commonwealth refrains as far as possible from detailed inspection of projects, since the States are the principals under the agreement. The States carry out the construction, allocation and maintenance of the houses as well as general estate management, and therefore must be treated as responsible people, capable of undertaking the detailed planning and implementation of their housing programmes.
