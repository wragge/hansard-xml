I now ask the Treasurer, in the absence pf the Prime Minister, whether further information on this subject has been obtained, because over 400 miners are now out of employment in the Hunter electorate. </para>

                        <para>- I direct to the Minister for Labour and National Service a question that arises from the fact that during his absence abroad the Minister for Defence, who acted in his stead, gave an assurance to a deputation of honorable members from this side of the House that he would have the question of making legislative provision for appeals against the decisions of magistrates in respect of applications for exemption from national military service, placed before the Government for consideration. Is the Minister yet in a position to announce the decision of the Government in respect of the matter and, if not, when does he expect to be able to do so? </para>

                        <para>- I have not yet had an opportunity to discuss this matter with the Minister for Defence, who acted on my behalf during my absence abroad. I know something of the background of the matter because a good deal of correspondence has passed between me and interested people who have written to the Government from time to time in connexion with it. I shall, however, discuss the latest position with my colleague. If he gave an assurance that the matter would be brought before Cabinet I shall ensure that that shall be done at the first opportunity. </para>

                        <para>- I direct to the Treasurer a question relative to the intention of the Government to guarantee a Commonwealth Bank loan to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. In view of the fact that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is a proprietary company and, therefore, is not obliged to publish its 'balance-sheet, but would be obliged to publish it if it went on to the market for a public loan, I ask the Treasurer whether the fact that the taxpayers will have to guarantee the Commonwealth Bank loan to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited will oblige the company to publish its balance-sheet ? </para>

                            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Labour and National Service. Members of this House have been endeavouring to obtain current information from the Minister's department in relation to the number of persons who are registered for employment in various localities. Will the Minister arrange to have up-to-date unemployment figures supplied to honorable members for the particular electorates that they represent ? Can figures be supplied which are not more than a week old instead of when they are a month old? </para>

                            <para>- I am not sure of the point that the honorable member has in mind when he speaks of figures being a month old. Obviously, figures that are collected for purposes of record are not collected every day. There must be some fixed period to which they relate, and I can imagine that there would be administrative difficulties in the way of collecting these statistics and presenting them publicly more frequently than is done at present. I assured the House some time ago that my department would try to keep the Parliament and the country fully informed of movements in the employment field, and, to the best of my knowledge, that was done during my absence abroad and it is still being done. Whether it would be practicable to dissect employment figures on an electorate basis is  a  matter that I should have to examine, because the offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service are not distributed  on an  electorate basis, and the figures  that  they collect in the areas  in  which  they  operate may not be definable  in  terms  of  electorates. However,  I  shall explore the possibility of doing  as  the honorable member has suggested. </para>

Subsequently, the amount was increased to 8s. a day. Under the present Government's hospital benefits scheme, .in respect  of  patients who are members of a registered organization, the Commonwealth pays 12s. a day for each occupied bed, which is twice the amount originally paid by the Chifley Government, and, in addition, the patient obtains 6s. a day from the organization, making a total of 18s. a day, or two and a quarter times the Chifley Government's highest payment. Also, the States have had restored to them the right to charge fees if they wish to do so. </para>

                            <para>- Answering the last part of the honorable member's question first, that is with regard to the Government's policy on the price of uranium to be purchased, I can tell him that I have before me at the moment some proposals for re-assessing the prices of uranium both in the concentrate form and in the ore form, because we believe that the prices published some time ago may now need revision. I hope that it will be possible, for the benefit of the public, to publish the new prices in the near future if the prices are changed. It is more difficult to be specific about the progress of general development, but it is not unknown that a committee of Cabinet had before it only a few days ago many aspects of this matter. It is possible that within a few days we shall be able to announce some specific decisions. So far, as the House knows, decisions have been made about the immediate development of the Rum Jungle area by a large mining corporation, and heads of agreement have been entered into between the Government and the corporation. As the House also knows from published statements, we have gone a long way towards agreement with the Joint British-American Combined Development Agency, for the purchase of Australian uranium and for financial assistance for Australia. Those matters are well under way. There also remain decisions to be made about the over-all control of the whole matter of uranium and atomic energy, and also about the policy that Australia should adopt so far as research and development are concerned. It is hoped that, before long, an announcement will be made about that matter. </para>

                        <para>- Matters relating to supplies of steel and steel products come within the jurisdiction of the Minister for National Development, whom I happen to represent in this House at present because of the' absence of the Minister for External Affairs abroad. I cannot speak with any authority on the cause of the shortage of steel. I think that the honorable member has mentioned to me before the difficulty that is being experienced by some manufacturers in obtaining steel for ploughs. I shall ask the Minister in another place to examine the matter to see what can be done to increase supplies. </para>

                        <para>- I shall see whether I can obtain the information. It would be extremely difficult to analyse the departures from Australia since the war in order to establish how many of the persons involved were assisted and unassisted immigrants. For many years past there has been a permanent movement from Australia each year of between 20,000 and 25,000 persons. Some, of course, have been Australians who have gone overseas to settle permanently. Some have been people either from Great Britain or from Europe who, having come to this country and having failed to settle as happily as they wished, have returned to their homelands. Others, who have been quite happily settled here, have, for family, business, or other reasons found it necessary to return to their former homelands or to go to some other part of the world. If the implication of the honorable member's question is that a considerable number of people who have tried to settle here have . not succeeded in doing so satisfactorily, I hasten to assure him that such is not the case. I think I can assure him, on the facts as I know them, that a relatively small proportion of the people who come to settle in Australia leave this country to return to the lands that they left to come here. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of the bill is to authorize the payment, during the current financial year, of special grants amounting to £15,934,000 to South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. The payment of these grants has been recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its nineteenth report, which was tabled to-day. In that report, the commission has adopted the same general principle and methods as it has adopted in recent years. The general principle followed is that of financial need which has been expressed by the commission in the following terms :  - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Special grants arc justified when a State through financial stress from any cause is unable efficiently to discharge its functions as a member of the federation and should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of the other States. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">In applying this principle, the commission makes a detailed comparison of the financial position and practices of the claimant and the non-claimant States. When making this comparison, the commission takes account of such factors as the relative efforts of the claimant States in raising revenue, and the levels of expenditure in the claimant States as compared with the non-claimant States. The commission has adopted a balanced budget standard as the starting point for its calculations, as it has done in recent years. It is, of course, impossible for the commission to make precise estimates of the special grants required to preserve due relativity with the non-claimant States in the year in which the grants are to be paid. To meet this difficulty, the grants recommended by the commission are divided into two parts. </para>
                    <para>One part of the grants represents the commission's estimate of the current financial needs of the claimant States. This part of the grants is treated by the commission as an advance payment which is subject to adjustment by the commission two years later when it has had the opportunity of examining in detail the audited budgets of the States for that year. The other part of the grants recommended by the commission each year represents a final adjustment of the special grants recommended two years previously. Thus, in its nineteenth report, the commission has made precise calculations of the special grants to which it considers the claimant States were entitled in 1950-51, and has compared those calculations with the advance payments made in 1950-51 in order to arrive at a final adjustment. The special grants recommended for payment in 1952-53 are therefore made up as follows : - </para>
                    <para>It will be noted that the grants recommended for payment to South Australia and "Western Australia this year were arrived at after deducting amounts of £257,000 and £159,000 respectively. These deductions represent the amounts by which the advance payments made in 1950-51 exceeded the financial needs of those States in that year as finally assessed by the commission. The special grants recommended for payment in 1952-53 are substantially greater than the special grants that were paid last year, the amount of the increase for each State being South Australia £1,785,000, Western Australia £2,953,000 and Tasmania £674,000, making a total increase of £5,412,000. If account is taken of the tax reimbursement and special financial assistance grants, the total increase in revenue grants to the claimant States this year is estimated at £8,712,000. </para>
                    <para>The commission, in its nineteenth report, has indicated that it has been particularly difficult to forecast with any degree of accuracy the amounts of the special grants which might be justified for 1952-53. In particular, the commission mentions the uncertainty which exists in respect of the future of wages and other costs and the revenues of State enterprises. At the same time, the commission points out that, under its procedures, the advance payments which it recommends for 1952-53 will be subject to adjustment two years hence when all the facts relating to 1952-53 become known. The commission has listed a number of factors that account for the increased financial needs of the claimant States in 1952-53. The more important of these factors include increased expenditure on social services, the effect on the State budgets of wage adjustments, and the effect on Western Australia's finances of the prolonged rail strike in that State. The special grants recommended by the Com?monwealth Grants Commission each year have invariably been adopted by successive governments, and the present Government considers that the commission's recommendations should be adopted again this year. </para>

                        <para>. - Speakers who have participated in this debate have dealt with the general operations of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which is more commonly known as the free medicine scheme. Although this is a short measure that relates to the implementation of pharmaceutical benefits, the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page),</inline> in his second-reading speech, took the opportunity to deal with the Government's national health scheme as a whole. He spoke at length about what the Government had done in this sphere since it assumed office. The right honorable gentleman stated - </para>

                    <para>I am pleased that this Government has recognized the need for a national health scheme. I recall the opposition that arose in certain quarters to implementation of the principal act when it was passed during the regime of the Chifley Government. Opponents of that legislation advanced the criticism that Labour was too willing to give to the people something for nothing. When that measure was being debated in this chamber, I emphasized that the responsibility that rests upon the National Government, regardless of party political considerations, to provide an effective national health scheme is just as grave as that which devolves upon it to ensure that the people shall be adequately clothed and fed. I am gratified at what has been done for the people under this legislation. However, I am perturbed about certain aspects of this measure. The statement of the Minister shows that the cost of pharmaceutical benefits last year was £6,699,000. ; When the Minister introduced the measure, he stated that the cost in the first year would be £2,500,000. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the Minister for Health for the information. I thought that the cost had risen sharply from £2,500,000 to nearly £7,000,000, but in any case the figures as corrected by the Minister show that the cost has risen from £5,000,000 to £7,000,000. I am concerned about the cost of the drugs, and I should like the Minister to inform the House whether the Government is certain that the price that it is paying for the drugs is fair and reasonable. I hope that the Government is not paying more than it should do from the taxpayer's money. Most of the money is being expended on life-saving drugs. They are a comparatively new innovation. Previously, various mixtures were prescribed by doctors for sick people. The honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Donald Cameron)</inline> stated yesterday that in recent years there had been a complete alteration in the treatment methods of the medical profession and that life-saving drugs were now being widely used. </para>

                            <para>- I want to know whether a proper check is being made of the prices charged for those drugs. I know that there is a list of the drugs and that, from time to time, the Department of Health adds new drugs to the list or removes others from it. Recently, the mixture or drug called  Hepasol  was removed from the list. I understand that it was removed because it had been abused to some degree. It had been prescribed extensively by medical men, although other drugs that were less expensive could have been used in substitution for it, with equally successful results. That proves that some check is being made of the expenditure upon these drugs, but I am concerned about the cost of them generally. </para>

                    <para>Some of the drugs on the list are manufactured by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, and others by drug houses. A great deal of credit is due to the laboratories of the drug houses for the research work that they have done and the improvements that they have made of certain important drugs, but I want to know whether the drug houses are' making a fair and reasonable profit on their pro-, ducts, or whether we are being required to pay more for them than we should pay. It must be borne in mind that almost the whole of the lifesaving drugs that are prescribed now are paid for by the Government. There is no means test under the scheme. A doctor prescribes a drug on the appropriate form, the patient- takes the prescription to a chemist, and the Government pays to the chemist the cost of the drug. I am impressed by the expenditure upon these drugs in each of the States, and by the number of prescriptions that are being dealt with. In New South Wales, the cost of 2,433,265 prescriptions was £2,520,246. The average cost of each prescription was a little over £1 in that State. That may be a fair and reasonable figure, but I should like the Minister to inform the House whether a proper check is being made of the cost of production of the drugs. In the case of imported drugs, the Government knows the prices charged by the overseas suppliers, and can ensure that only a reasonable margin of profit will be made by the drug houses in this country, which distribute them. I want to be sure that the taxpayers of this country will not be called upon to pay more for life-saving drugs than is reasonable. Through the years, we have board it said that, when schemes are devised for the provision of certain things to the public free of charge, some people try to take advantage of those schemes, and that, at times, there are rackets in connexion with them. I do not mako. any accusation of over-charging or racketeering in connexion with these  drugs  but I am concerned about the average cost of each prescription, which, in New South Wales, is, as I have shown, over fi. In the past, prescriptions did not- cost as much as that. I know that, a year or two ago, a doctor told a patient that be could prescribe a drug that would cost about £2 10s., and asked the patient whether he could afford to pay that amount if the drug were prescribed. He went on to say that there was another drug that he could prescribe, which would cost about 12s. 6d. He said it was possible that that drug would be successful, but he was not  satisfed  that it would be. He explained, that, rather than take any risk, he would, prescribe the £2 10s. drug if the patient could afford to pay for it. The patient elected to have the drug that cost £2 10s. That, of course, was before the introduction of the scheme under which life-saving drugs are supplied free of charge. I am wondering whether a proper check is kept to ensure that, in the supplying of these drugs, Commonwealth money is not being expended unnecessarily. I make those remarks not in a spirit of criticism, but with a view to analysing the work of the committees. </para>
                    <para>There is one other matter with which I am rather concerned. It was mentioned in the Minister's second-reading speech. I refer to the danger of the indiscriminate use of drugs. Are we running any risk that, after a number of years, resistance to certain drags will develop in patients, so that we shall be worse off than we were before the discovery of those drugs ? I hope that sufficient care will be taken to avoid that danger. I realize that it is largely a matter of trial and error. </para>

                            <para>- The basis is probably firmer now, but at the beginning it was a matter of trial and error. Some time ago, the Minister told us that, during his visit to the United States of America he was informed that certain drugs had been, administered too freely and without adequate knowledge of their effects with the result that some most undesirable consequences had followed. I was gratified at. the Minister's assurance that great care was being taken in this country to ensure that these drugs shall be administered only by persons who understand their reactions and their probable results. It is clear that some form of control must be exercised. According to the Minister, the committee administering this matter consists' entirely of medical men with the exception of the secretary, who is a public servant. Such, a committee may be competent to decide which drugs shall be put on the free list and how they shall be prescribed and administered, but I do not think that a disciplinary committee charged with the duty of keeping check on the activities of doctors should be composed entirely of medical men, or that a committee appointed to supervise the pharmaceutical side of the scheme should consist entirely of pharmaceutical chemists. That is a matter to which the Minister could well give further consideration. These committees should include other qualified persons who are not members of the professions that are involved. Some time ago, in South Australia, a doctor was charged with having adopted undesirable practices. I shall not discuss how serious the charges were or the merits or demerits of his action.', but. according to information that I received, the British Medical Association brought pressure to bear to ensure that no publicity would be given to the  charges  I consider that if the committee is finally constituted in the manner proposed, colour wil'l be lent to a suspicion that it will 'husk up matters not creditable to the medical profession. I do not say that there are grounds for such ,a suspicion. It 13 also possible that, were the committee formed of doctors only, it could .discriminate against other doctors. There are a number of people who will believe, rightly or wrongly - I think mostly wrongly - that the doctors on the committee  will  look after the members of their association and, as I have said, hush up anything that might be detrimental to those members, </para>

                            <para>- That objection might exist. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Allan Eraser)</inline> referred last night to the fact that if a doctor or a chemist were treated harshly by the respective committee, he might be unable to continue to operate his practice successfully. <inline font-style="italic">X.</inline> agree that that could occur, although I think that doctors generally are well able to fend for themselves. Without wishing to level an indictment against any individual I say that there is a great deal of jealousy in the medical profession generally, also in the .British Medical Association as far as the admission of certain doctors to membership of the association is concerned. I know personally of cases in which doctor? have been refused membership of the British Medical Association, I know of one practising medical man who is regarded as a highly qualified doctor and whose surgical work, some years ago in respect of an important operation, was commended by the leading surgeons of Adelaide - </para>

                            <para>- I am referring to the committee, and dealing with its possible attitude to medical men. I merely wish to stress the danger inherent in .the proposed composition of the committee. I know of certain medical men who were not permitted to enjoy the advantages of membership of the British Medical Association, and I am wondering whether there is .a possibility of the committee taking action of any kind that would he to the disadvantage of such people. Wages boards, for instance, are composed of representatives of the trade unions and the employers, but the  chairman  is an independent person. It is not customary to have as  chairman  of such a board a person who has not the kind of ability required or whose interest leans towards either of the parties represented on the hoard. It is usual to have a capable, disinterested individual as  chairman.  I suggest to the Minister that the membership of the boards proposed under this measure should .not be confined to doctors and chemists, but should include some responsible and highly qualified person with an independent outlook, who would act for the welfare of the community generally. That is the one criticism that I desire to make of the bill. </para>

                    <para>I am pleased with the success of the scheme for the provision of free drugs to pensioners. The fact that drugs are available free to pensioners has lifted from many pensioners a source of worry that itself could have caused illness requiring extensive medical treatment. The Minister and the honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Donald Cameron)</inline> have both spoken about the disadvantages of the formulary that was provided under the Chifley Government's scheme. I shall not say much about either formularies or formulae, because those matters are beyond the comprehension of the layman, but I say that everything necessary for the treatment of sick people should be made available free. I have not heard much complaint about the operation of the scheme" under which free drugs are provided to pensioners. Generally speaking, the scheme is working well, and members of the medical profession have told me that it is satisfactory to them. I asked a prominent medical officer in my electorate how the scheme compared with schemes elsewhere, and how the list of the drugs supplied under it compared with the list contained in the <inline font-style="italic">British Pharmacopoeia.</inline> He told me that they compared favorably. I havelittle criticism to make of the measure,although in some respects it doesnotgosofaras the Labour party would go were itin office. Our objective in respect of health and medical services is well Known. It is to increase the list of free life-saving drugs' until all drugs are provided free. </para>

                            <para>- I recognize that fact. I do not claim that all the blame in connexion with the operation of the Chifley Government's health scheme should be borne by one side. Perhaps some blame was attachable to both' sides. However, I am concerned at the present time, not with the apportionment of blame but with the introduction of a practical scheme that will best serve the interests of the people. The Minister, with his scheme, is giving expression, to some degree, to the Labour party's idea of the welfare state. Of course, he has not gone so far as we should like. I suppose that he has gone about 50 per cent. of the way. </para>

                        <para>.- It appears to methatthe stage has been reached in this debate when little of a useful nature is now being contributed to it. The honorable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> has been at least reasonable in some of his statements. He admitted that the schemewhich has been put into operation by the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> has been a great success. He claimed that his only concernwas for the introduction of a satisfactory nationalhealth and medical service. If anyperson takes that view, he mu st admit quite frankly that the present scheme has been an overwhelming success in the short timethatit has been in existence. Yesterday, we were treated to two particularly good speeches on this bill. One of them was made by the honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Donald Cameron),</inline> who is a medical practitioner of great ability, and the other was by the honorable member for Isaacs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haworth),</inline> who is a pharmaceutical chemist. Those two speeches were an edification to this House, and must have been of great interest to the people who were listening to the broadcast of the proceedings, because both honorable members dealt with the technical aspects of a pharmaceutical benefits scheme, and indicated the far-reaching ramifications of it. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I do not pretend - and I have not heard any other person, who was not qualified, pretend - to understand precisely the impact of a health scheme of this kind upon the people. I listened with great interest to the speech of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Allan Fraser),</inline> who was the spokesman for the Opposition on this bill, and his painful struggles with the subject were pitiful in comparison  with the clear, concise expositions given by the technical men on this side of the House, who understand the position. I believe that the stage has now been reached when, except for generalizations, there is little to be said on this bill. The amazing thing about the whole free medicine scheme is the wonderful success that has been achieved by the co-operative approach of the present Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline> The people of Australia have not forgotten the difficulties, ill feeling, and bad blood that resulted from the efforts of the Chifley Government to introduce a free medicine scheme. Its attempt was so completely unsuccessful that the figures relating to it are almost staggering. The Chifley Government struggled with the problem for years, yet its expenditure on its pharmaceutical benefits scheme in 194S-49 amounted to only £149,000. The present Government expended on its free medicine scheme in the last financial year an amount of £6,600,000. Those figures will give the people an indication of the difference between the two schemes. </para>
                    <para>Opposition members attempt to defend the failure of the Chifley Government's scheme by saying that the previous Minister for Health, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline> could not get the co-operation of the medical fraternity and the   pharmaceutical chemists. However, the Labour Government could not expect co-operation from those important sections, because the whole basis of its legislation was coercion. ' The Chifley Government attempted to dictate to the medical profession and pharmaceutical chemists, who were the only sections that could effectively operate the free medicine scheme. The Labour Government endeavoured to lay its heavy socialist hand upon the professional men, and to dictate to them what they should do and how they should do it. Indeed, the policy of the Chifley Government in that respect was so foolish that it is, difficult to understand. One has only to read the various acts placed on the statute-book by the Chifley Government in an attempt to give effect to its health scheme to realize how pathetic were its efforts to provide free medicine for the people. The Chifley Government was more concerned with bringing about the complete nationalization of the medical profession, pharmaceutical chemists and hospitals than with establishing a satisfactory health scheme in the interests of the people. Some of those acts will remain on the statute-book until the Minister introduces a comprehensive bill to provide a national health and medical service. </para>
                    <para>I am glad to learn that the Minister is not giving effect to certain provisions in those acts, although I realize that his omission has not the approval of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro. To me, it is a grand thing that members of the medical profession stood out against the dictatorial policy of the Chifley Labour Government. The stage was reached when doctors were virtually told what they were to prescribe for their patients. That was utter nonsense. The  Chifley  Government adopted a ridiculous approach to the establishment of a health service. It can be fairly said that no other profession in the world can be relied upon to observe the high ethical standard that lias been set by the medical fraternity in this country. The people of Australia should be mighty proud of the great men whom it has produced in this field. It is always possible to have a few black sheep in any flock, but I believe - and 1 am tie father of two young doctors - that the medical profession is one of the most wonderful professions in which man can engage. However, the Chifley Government decided to challenge the doctors in their own field of healing, and brought them into the hurly-burly and scrum of political machinations. It is a good thing for the people of Australia that the doctors stood out against the efforts of the Chifley Government to impose its so-called free medicine scheme upon the community. </para>

                            <para>- That matter does not arise. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro knows perfectly well that when the Chifley Government attempted unfairly to impose its dictatorial policy upon members of the medical profession, the matter was taken to the High Court of Australia, and the legislation was declared unconstitutional. There was no question of defiance of the law. I invite honorable members to compare the achievements of the present Minister for Health with the abortive efforts of the Chifley Government in this field. The efforts of the present Minister have been crowned with success. In the short period that has  elpased  since he first announced the scheme in 1950, he has conferred incalculable benefits upon the people of Australia in the provision of free medicine, pharmaceutical benefits, hospital benefits, tuberculosis allowances, free milk for school children and free medical and hospital treatment for pensioners. All of us are proud of his achievements, which will be written into the history of Australia. In the last twelve months no fewer than 6,512,826 prescriptions have been dispensed under this scheme. When these are added to the number of prescriptions freely dispensed for pensioners, it will be seen that the total represents a large percentage of the total number of prescriptions written by the members of the medical profession in that period. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> fewer than 7,000 doctors are cooperating with the Government in this scheme, compared with the paltry 150 who were prepared to enter the scheme instituted by the Chifley Government. </para>

It is true that the cost of social services of this kind is extremely high, but it must not be forgotten that this is a preventive scheme, the lasting results of which may not be immediately apparent. The drugs included in the list have been very carefully selected by eminent medical men, and people now receive medical treatment which they would never be able to afford to pay for themselves. It is impossible to number the lives that have been saved and the amount of suffering that has been alleviated. </para>

                    <para>The purpose of the bill is to establish professional advisory committees nominated by executives of the professional organizations engaged in implementing the scheme. An impartial observer who listened to a debate on the measure yesterday must have been struck by the need to appoint to these committees men of the highest eminence in the medical and pharmaceutical professions. </para>
                    <para class="block">Honorable' members opposite object to the proposal that these committees shall consist of persons who know all' about the matters with which they will be called upon to deal'. Objection to it was meekly voiced by the honorable' member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson),</inline> but it was most vehemently expressed by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Allan Eraser)'.</inline> There is no substance in these objections. I am at a loss to understand why the Opposition should object to this measure unless it is for opposition's sake. The scheme is based on the closest co-operation and' liaison between the inedical and pharmaceutical professions of the Government. That has been the keynote of the health- policy applied by the Minister since the- inception of the scheme-. The principle of co-operation is continued fir the establishment of these committees'. How, then, can it be contended that these committees will not be established on a proper basis? Cooperation and- goodwill are necessary to enable them to function perfectly. </para>
                    <para>The people realize the benefits that : accrue to them from this scheme and its great value to the nation. It is expensive,but all these trends towards the establishment of the welfare state are inevitably expensive In recent years the people have been encouraged to believe that if they elect to office the representatives of a political party which promises them the earth their lives will thereafter be rosy. Nothing could be further from the truth. If we establish a welfare state, we must be prepared to pay for it. Do not let us run away with the idea that we are going to get something for nothing. This concession is free only in the sense that the individual who needs medical assistance can go to a doctor, get a prescription, and then have his prescriptionfilled by a chemist for nothing. However, that person ultimately does not get his medicine for nothing, because he has to pay for it by way of taxation. If we want these very desirable amenities we must be prepared to pay for them. The people should clearlyunderstand that, and it must be impressed strongly upon them that if we are to carry out the idea of the welfare statewhich in many respects seems to be the modern doctrine of go vernment, then the people must pay for it. The greatest tiling in life is  a  propter evaluation of human welfare and of the needs of the people. Flesh and blood are more important than anything else in the world, and we must always bear that in mind in our economic thinking; I consider that the belief of many people that the amenities that they enjoy are free should be dissipated. They  are not  free, they are all paid for By the people. Those who may not need the assistance of a free medicine scheme should thank. God that they are so well that they do not need medicine, and they should be willing to pay, through their taxes', for. a. scheme that will benefit so many people. However, our social services continue to increase in number and cost. I believe that the scheme under consideration, will cost about £7,000,000 a year, and the people should understand that if all these services are to be maintained the people themselves will have to pay for them and they must not quibble at having to pay for them through their taxes.. </para>
                    <para>Let us ensure that there shall be no waste in our administration of social services. Let the people remember that when they are receiving these social services they should not waste them, because ultimately they will pay, in some form or other, for whatever they use and what ever services are given to them To waste the goods and services supplied free by the Government is a criminal sin. The scheme that the House is considering is a brilliant scheme, and should get the unanimous endorsement of honorable members: This country should be' proud of the efforts of its Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page),</inline> and I believe that his scheme will do  a  great amount of good in saving lives throughout Australia.I also believe that this Government is on the right track with regard to the management of the scheme, and the setting up of the committees that it proposes to set up. I am looking forward to the time when the Minister will introduce a bill to consolidate and bring together into the one measure all the benefits that he has been putting into effect. When that is completed the Minister will have performed  one of the greatest tasks in the history of Australia in the interests of those who cannot help themselves. </para>

                        <para>.- I join with honorable members on this side of the House in a general criticism of the measure now before us. All the fine phrases and flowing oratory of the honorable member for Bennelong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cramer)</inline> about the beneficial results that will flow from this measure will neither convince the Opposition nor a majority of the people that it is anything like the success that he would have u3 believe. The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> has been responsible for the most muddled administration of health that has ever occurred in our history.  His  statements about the free medicine scheme and about, the general administration of the Department of Health have been made in the main at Australian Country party conferences or at meetings of the British Medical Association. He has made his statements everywhere but here, where they should have been made. Even now we find that the bill states one thing and the Minister states, in his second-reading speech, something else. It is impossible for people to understand the implications of the scheme, and in those circumstances I am not surprised that the honorable member for Bennelong showed a deplorable ignorance of the general administration of health in this country. I shall mention only a few of the matters that he dealt with. He said that the Minister for Health was a great Minister and was responsible for co-ordinating the medical profession and the people in order to produce the scheme that is now before the House. He said that doctors were freely co-operating, through the British Medical Association, with this most competent measure. </para>

                    <para>I do not understand why the British Medical Association should not cooperate with the Minister because the Minister has practically given them control of the scheme. To-day, the British Medical Association is accepting proposals that it refused to accept, because of so-called high principles, when they were made by the Chifley Government. I do not criticize individual doctors ; I criticize the British </para>
                    <para class="block">Medical Association for its approach to this matter. To-day, the British Medical Association has accepted the forms and methods suggested by the Chifley Government, which it previously refused because of its high principles. Honorable members can work out for themselves why the British Medical Association has changed its attitude. The honorable member for Bennelong, said that the Chifley Government restricted the formulary. Any one who has studied the records of the Parliament and the newspaper criticisms of the Chifley scheme knows full well that the formulary of the Chifley Government embraced over 600 items and over 99 per cent, of the requirements of the people. Indeed, diseases from the most casual to the most serious were covered by this very extensive formulary. Moreover, the formulary was prepared by skilled persons who were associated with medicine in this country. All that has been thrown overboard by this Government, and to-day, under the present scheme, we find that life-saving drugs are to be almost as dear as radium. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Bennelong and the Minister for Health said that the Chifley Government tried to coerce the medical profession into acceptance of its scheme. That is not so. Every possible approach was made to the British Medical Association by the Chifley Government because that Government believed that all the people, irrespective of their incomes or means, should have all possible benefits from the medical knowledge that we now have. If the rich want legal or medical advice they can well afford to pay for it, but throughout the length and breadth of the community there are thousands of people who cannot afford to buy medicine and must have it given to them by the Government. That was the Chifley Government's approach to this matter. It did not desire to .give a public benefit in the field of medicine to all people, whether they were able to pay for it or not. "We submitted our proposals to the British Medical Association in all good faith, but they were rejected for reasons of high principle - or so we were told. Perhaps I, and other honorable members on this side of the House, may be excused  for believing that the high principles of the British Medical Association have been thrown overboard and that a change of government has given it a change of heart. There must have been some general opposition to the scheme merely because a Labour government proposed it. I do not believe that the medical profession, as individuals, was opposed to the Chifley scheme, but I believe that their opposition was stirred up by influential sections of the British Medical Association. </para>
                    <para>As was said by the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> by way of interjection while the honorable member for Bennelong was speaking, the British Medical Association at that time defied the law of the land. Doctors are entitled to go on strike if they want to. I believe in the right of men to strike when all other means of redressing their just grievances have failed, but it was surprising to me to see at that time honorable members, now on the Government side, who had criticized trade unionists for striking, openly supporting a strike against the interests of the people. I am not going into the pros and cons of those things other than to say that I am pleased that the broad basis of the Chifley Government's scheme of free medicine is to-day winning the commendation of many honorable members opposite, although the Minister for Health continues to condemn it in no uncertain terms. That the British Medical Association realizes that its criticism of the Chifley Government's scheme was unfair is proved by the fact that many of the provisions of that scheme have been incorporated in the present scheme. It cannot be claimed that this scheme is the ideal, because it makes provision for the supply of only a very limited number of drugs, which were referred to by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.- Morgan),</inline> during an excellent speech last night, as wonder drugs. I subscribe to the view that has been expressed by the honorable member for Reid and other honorable members on this side of the House that the scheme that is now being sponsored by the Minister for Health is really a public benefit for the drug houses of this country. The provision of wonder drugs at over. £1 a time has become the accepted basis of the scheme. </para>
                    <para>I cannot agree with the honorable member for Bennelong that excellentspeeches have been delivered on this subject by the honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Donald Cameron)</inline> and the honorable member for Isaacs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Haworth).</inline> The only excellent speeches that I have heard during this debate have been delivered by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Allan Fraser),</inline> the honorable member for Reid and the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clyde Cameron),</inline> which at least showed a practical appreciation of this problem without regard to technicalities. Although the honorable member for Oxley is a member of the medical profession, and the honorable member for Isaacs is a member of the Pharmaceutical Guild, their speeches showed no practical appreciation of the real requirements of a. pharmaceutical benefits scheme for the people of this country. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro made a constructive approach to the subject by revealing the shortcomings of the present scheme. He showed that it is open to the widest possible criticism, as a result of bad administration, and because it does not provide for supply to sick people of all the drugs that they may require. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clark)</inline> has referred to the colossal cost of the scheme. The expenditure on pharmaceutical benefits during the last financial year was £6,699,002, excluding amounts totalling £598,279 that were paid to public hospitals and other instrumentalities. The average cost of the 6,512,826 prescriptions that were issued in that year was a shade more than £1. During the operation of the Chifley Government's scheme £294,446 was expended on 903,027 prescriptions, which was an average cost of 6s. 6d. While admitting that inflation has run riot since- the present Government has been in office, <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> cannot see why the cost of prescriptions should be now almost three times the cost of prescriptions that were issued under the Chifley Government's scheme. </para>
                    <para>I shall now address myself to the subject of profiteering on drugs. According  to the <inline font-style="italic">Wild Cat Monthly,</inline> which publishes the balance-sheets of public companies, Drug Houses of Australia Limited, which was registered in Victoria in September, 1929, made a net profit in 1950 of £357,690. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In 1951 its net profit was £443,629. Its reserves were increased from £2,049,666 in 1950 to £2,201,588 in 1951. Those figures reflect the benefits to the company of the cost of £1 a prescription under the scheme that this Government is sponsoring. That is why the Minister has avoided giving information about the scheme to honorable members. He knows that there is something wrong, and that only a limited number of drugs is being supplied to the people. It would have been preferable for the Government to have implemented the Chifley Government's scheme, under which approximately 99 per cent, of the requirements of the people were supplied. The cost of that scheme was only a fraction of the cost of the present scheme. It is time that the Minister for Health woke up to himself, because criticism of the scheme, particularly in relation to the cost of prescriptions, has come from all sections of the community.

                <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page introduced his freedrug scheme in August, 3 950", he estimated that it would cost the Commonwealth about £2,500,000 a year. On Tuesday he revealed  that, in the twelve months ended on June 30, it in fact cost £6,699,000. As he said, it is impossible to calculate the lives saved by the scheme and the amount of human suffering alleviated; but the rise in cost is alarming.  . . The Government is appointing committees with statutory powers to investigate cases of extravagance and malpractice. These committees will not have the power, as in Britain, to make erring doctors pay the cost of unnecessary drugs, but they should at least serve as some check on extravagance. </para></quote>
                <para class="block">That statement pinpoints my remarks about the excessive cost of prescriptions. It is almost time that the Minister woke up to the fact that this scheme is a public benefit for the drug houses of this country and a number of other people in the category of backyard manufacturers, because, as the honorable member for Eden-Monaro has pointed out, a large per  centage  of prescriptions are for proprietary lines.</para> <interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2933</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KWJ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">TRELOAR, Thomas</name><name role="display">Mr Treloar</name></talker><para>- Does the honorable member suggest that the trade unions should be represented on the committees ? </para></talk.start></interjection><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2933</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>6V4</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DALY, Fred</name><name role="display">Mr DALY</name></talker><para>- I cannot imagine that the honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Treloar)</inline> would sit idly by if the Government proposed to establish committees to deal with primary industries without making provision for the appointment to those committees of representatives of the primary producer?. Obviously, doctors and chemists must be appointed to the proposed committees, but the consumers, who are vitally interested, should be represented also. The suggestion is not intended to be humorous. Perhaps the Housewives Association would be a suitable body from which to choose lay members of the committees. No doubt the Minister will oppose my suggestion, because he is entirely dominated by the British Medical Association and, when that organization puts a gun to his ribs, he jumps to obey its directions. The association may often be right, but it makes many mistakes. Therefore, I suggest that practical laymen be appointed to the committees in order to add their wisdom to that of <inline font-style="italic">th».</inline> medical experts who, although they may be highly skilled in their profession, may not be efficient administrators.  "Why did the Minister decide to abolish certain provisions of the Chifley legislation of 1947, which provided for the effective supervision and administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme? "We must have the co-operation of doctors if the scheme is to work efficiently, but we must ensure that they observe the ethical standards of their profession and that the scheme is implemented with justice to all. There is always room in organizations of this character for representatives of the ordinary men and women in the street. I should like to know whether the proposed committees are intended to be a front behind which the Minister proposes to conceal his incompetence in relation to health matters. Will the committees be solely advisory, or will they be authorized to take effective action again malpractices? Why does not the right honorable gentleman adopt the suggestion that was made by the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and provide that doctors or chemists who abuse the scheme shall pay for drugs that they make available to patients unnecessarily? </para></talk.start><para>The Minister apparently proposes to yield to all the representations made to him by those whom he wishes to appease, whether their proposals be good or bad. We may expect from him nothing but muddled planning of the kind that this bill represents. The Minister, notwithstanding his good intentions, was aptly named in the past "the tragic Treasurer ", and he now deserves to be known as the tragic Minister for Health. The right honorable gentleman should be made to realize that the people are not satisfied with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Only a few drugs are made available, at excessive cost to the Treasury, to a small section of the community. I am glad that pensioners are now able to obtain free medicines. Of all members of the community, they have the strongest claim to assistance of that kind. The benefits to which they are now entitled would have been made available to them much earlier if the British Medical Association had been prepared to accept the free medicine scheme on the terms laid down by the Chifley Government. They rejected that Government's proposals for various obscure reasons that they referred to as matters  of highprinciple. </para><para>I do not wish to delay the  passage of  the bill. I am in general agreement  with  its provisions, but I  hope  that  the Minister  for Health will give earnest  consideration  to the constructive  criticism*  that I have expressed and not allow  himself  to be deluded by the applause  of  Government supporters. Medicine  at.  present is an expensive item in  every  family budget, and it should  be made  available free of charge to all sections of the community. Pharmaceutical  benefits  should not be confined to persons  who  are at death's door. Under the  present  scheme, patients are unable to  obtain  free medicine unless they are in desperate need of life-saving drugs.  Has the  Minister any idea of the number  of  patients who have been saved by  the  use of wonder drugs? Apparently a patient must have one foot in the  graveand  one foot in the hospital  before he  can obtain free medicine under  the  present scheme. Special life-saving  drugsoften  have not been available  in  emergencies, and stocks have had  to beflown  from the United States of America. Dollars should be made available  for the  importation of such important medicines. The Minister, apparently, has  done  nothing about these shortages. </para><para>The present scheme is limited in  scope,  is far too costly, and only a small section of the community benefits from  it. Asthe  honorable member for EdenMonarohas said, the scheme is not operating satisfactorily, and antibiotic drugs  are  being issued recklessly without regard  for  the public benefit. As I have demonstrated, the Chifley Government  provided  free drugs for patients at an average  cost of  6s. 6d. for each prescription,  whereasthis  Government provides only  a few  drugs at an average cost  of  £1. I have  referred  to the increasing costs and  swollen  reserves of drug companies, and  other  honorable members have pointed  out the  profiteering in drugs that is  being  practised. All these faults should  becarefully  examined  with  a view to  their  elimination. I commend the  principle of  the bill, but I point out that  there is  plenty  of  scope  for  the improvement  of  the scheme. The Minister should  not be  complacent about it. I ask  him to give more information about his plans to this -Parliament instead of making all sorts of optimistic declarations to conferences of the Australian Country party and other outside organizations-. He should bring down a bill that will give effect to thePromises that he has made, in place of this measure, the provisions of which conflict with the statements that he made in his second-reading speech. Even Government supporters have beenconfused by his vague statements. Sub ject-to the constructive criticisms that I Ihaveexpressed, I give my blessing to the bill, but I hope that the Minister will heedour proposals and improve upon his present seheme. </para><para>Mir.LESLIE (Moore) [12.28].- I could not fail to gain the impression, when the honorable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly)</inline> was speaking, that the honorable gentleman was afflicted by a facial bulge which indicated that he was speaking with his tongue in his cheek. I cannot believe that he is unmindful of the fact that Australia now has an effective pharmaceutical benefits scheme, whereas, before this Government came to power, we had a scheme that did not work. It is all very well to say that the British. Medical Association refused to co-operate. Thesuggestion that it was a strike against legislation is ridiculous. The position is thatthemembers of the British Medical Association refused to be conscripted, as would other self-respecting individuals in a free democracy. They merely exercised a right. Naturally, they objected ito having their professional judgment circumscribed as the Chifiey Government free medicine scheme proposed to do. Fundamentally,that was the most objec-   tionable featurein the eyes of the professional men.I suggest that the same consideration would apply if artisans, with whom honorable members opposite claim- to have a special friendship, were told bySome one with no special skill or    technical training how they should do their job. The medical profession must live up to a veryhigh code. Naturally it wouldobject to the limitations which the </para><para class="block">Chifley  Government health scheme pro- posed. </para><para>The honorable member for Grayndler voiced the old political philosophy of the Anstralian Labour party - that the people should be told that they are to be given something for nothing. At election time, the idea is to tell them that they are to receive a little more than was previously suggested. As all honorable members know, the people cannot be given something for nothing. Somebody must pay, either directly or indirectly. It is the people who pay in the long run,- usually through the nose. There is an essential difference between the scheme proposed by theChifley Government and that which is now operating under the present Government. The Chifley Government proposed nationalization of medicine, whereas the present Government has provided a really workable national health scheme. </para><para>It cannot be denied that the welfare state has come to stay, nor will anybody deny the need for the welfare state. Its creationcannot be claimed by any particular political party; it has come about through the exercise of christian principles by the people. It should be understood, of course, that socialism and nationalization do not make for the establishment of a welfare state. The ideal welfare state can be attained only whilst christian principles are allowed to operate and to influence our minds. Socialism and nationalization, which do not recognize christian principles, involve the application of compulsion. They take no account of human nature or of the fact that, instilled into every man and woman by a greater Being, is something finer than mere animal instincts. An essential precept of the. welfare state is that every individual should bear his personal share of responsibility for his own welfare. That is inherent in the system. Those responsible for the administration of the true welfare state say to the people, in effect, We shall ensure that a fair share of the benefits of science and the amenities of civilization are made available to you ". No one will deny that that is inherent in the present national health' scheme. In a true welfare state, those who are prepared to assume a share ofresponsibility for the maintenance of their own health are assured that they will not be denied those things which are essential to' their wellbeing in time of need. That is the idea behind the national health scheme which has been introduced by the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline></para><para>It should be appreciated that in the history of Australia many monuments stand to the achievements of the present Minister for Health. They are monuments for which any honest person will give the right honorable gentleman credit. In my opinion, the health scheme which is now in operation is the greatest achievement of his long period of public life, because it is a workable scheme which, no doubt, will be with us forever, and it deals with human lives. The right honorable gentleman is making a success of the scheme. That success will continue because the scheme has been built on sound foundations. I cannot help feeling that when members of the Opposition, such as the honorable member for Grayndler, who have the capacity to reason and to think logically, review this scheme, they would really prefer to pay tribute to the achievements of the Minister and the Government rather than to indulge in uncharitable criticism for purely political reasons. As I have already stated, their condemnatory and unwarranted comments are often made with tongue in cheek. </para><para>The criticism has been made that the f  free  medicine scheme denies to individuals the right to obtain other kinds of medicine. That, of course, is an excellent thing. If the purpose of a scheme such as this were merely to fill the stomachs of the people with medicines of all kinds for the relief of small or imaginary aches and pains, goodness knows what it would cost. As I see this scheme, the Minister is endeavouring to eliminate serious illness which causes loss and suffering, and,  perhap,  early death, to many people. The free milk scheme is part of the health scheme, although very few people associate the two. The provision of free milk for school children is as important as the provision of expensive drugs for adults. The idea behind the free milk scheme is to promote healthy bodies which are capable of resisting disease. If that objective is achieved, the ultimate, annual cost of the national health scheme will be very much lower, because there will be less need to dispense something for nothing. The cost will decrease as a healthy com-  munity  is established. The free milk scheme is therefore an economical one from the national point of view. </para><para>It has been suggested that the committees, which it is proposed to set up under this bill, should include what the honorable member for Grayndler has referred to facetiously as a " consumers' representative ". I do not believe that it is advisable to establish committees of a limited nature. There is a danger in setting up a professional committee such as that which is proposed in this bill. Because of a sort of  freemasonery  that exists among professional men, such a committee could become an instrument of protection for the medical profession. However, the honorable member for Grayndler has overlooked the fact that the bill provides for one representative on the committee to be a member of the Public Service. That man will be able to police the activities of the committee. He will watch the interests both of the Government and the consumer. I have had misgivings about restricted committees but I consider that the public interest will be safeguarded by the constitution of this committee. </para><para>The basis of the Government's health scheme of which the free medicine scheme forms part, is the saving of life and the prevention of disease. That is the reason why the list of free medicines is limited to life-saving drugs. This is a good provision. I hope that, as a result of this scheme, people will come to have greater confidence in the value of obtaining treatment for disease at an early stage. In this way they will avoid the cost of purchasing drugs which, if they are not; harmful, may at least be worthless. I am very fearful of the quality of patent medicines which are at present on the market. Many of them are taken without any knowledge of their contents and I am satisfied that they do great harm. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2936</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JVA</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MORGAN, Charles</name><name role="display">Mr Morgan</name></talker><para>- The more you have, themore you want. </para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2936</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>L19</name.id><electorate>MOORE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LESLIE, Hugh</name><name role="display">Mr LESLIE</name></talker><para>- I agree.

It is far better to endeavour to prevent disease than to confine a scheme of this kind to efforts to cure disease. I trust that the operation of this scheme will reduce the degree to which people are now prone to rely upon the use of patent medicines which, in most instances, do more harm than good. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I direct the attention of the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> to the need to provide assistance to parents in the provision of curative and general medicinal appliances for physically handicapped children. I suggest that the Government should make provision under this scheme for the supply of such appliances in instances in which they are prescribed by a medical practitioner. In that way, physically handicapped children would be assisted to assume a normal role in life. The cost of such appliances is a heavy burden on the parents of such children, partcularly children who have not reached maturity and who outgrow the appliances from time to time. Thus, in many instances, this cost is recurrent until the affected child reaches physical maturity. Tfe provision of such assistance should be regarded as being inherently a part of a scheme of the kind with which this measure deals. I support the bill and commend the Minister for having introduced it. I also congratulate him upon the wonderful job that he is doing. It is generally acknowledged that this scheme is operating successfully. It will prove of immense value to the nation and will be a fitting monument to the Minister who has devoted so much time and effort to initiating it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2937</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KXZ</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PETERS, Edward</name><name role="display">Mr PETERS</name></talker><para>. - I was not very impressed by the logic of the honorable member for Moore <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Leslie).</inline> He said that it was more important that the Government should attempt to prevent sickness in the community rather than to implement a free medicine scheme.

He believes that prevention is better than cure. I can only conclude from his remarks that he believes that the Government should not provide assistance to persons who are suffering from minor illnesses, which might ultimately become serious, but should withhold its assistance in respect of such persons until they are practically at death's door, at which stage it should make provision for the supply of lifesaving drugs to them. That was the theme of the honorable member's remarks. </para></talk.start><para>I note with pleasure the acceptance, qualified though it may be, by the Government of a free medicine  Scheme  and also the fact that Government supporters now  accept  the principle of a free medicine scheme which they strenuously opposed for many years.

At that time, an eminent member of the medical profession said that it would be most undesirable that the Government should institute a free medicine scheme because such a scheme would result in the wholesale consumption of what he called " placebo cocktails ". He said -  " Placebo " is a Latin word meaning " I shall please ". When a doctor prescribes a " placebo " he writes down the first. thing that strikes him, for it is the consumer's faith in the mixture that counts, and not what the doctor thinks about it at all. A " placebo " is harmless, and it helps to pass the time. </para><para class="block">That authority went on to say that if a free medicine scheme were introduced - </para><quote><para>It will be like drinks on the house, when everyone staggers up for his pot, blind to its worth, but " unco nappy " at getting it for nothing. </para></quote><para class="block">Opponents of the Chifley Government's scheme protested against the provision of not only some, but all, classes of medicines, or drugs, free of charge. They displayed the conservative attitude that has been adopted by reactionaries down through the years in respect of every radical reform that has been proposed _in this or in any other country. That was the attitude that they adopted when free secular education was proposed. Speaking in the Legislative Council in the Victorian Parliament at that time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gavin</inline> Duffy said, in effect, " Free education for the workers ! All they need is a little arithmetic and writing. Educated above that, they will be educated above their stations and there will be difficulty in obtaining workers at all." Similarly, when the provision of age pensions was first proposed the reactionary predecessors of supporters of the present Government declared that such a scheme would pauperize the community. The attitude of Government supporters is that the ordinary individual in the community is pauperized by the provision of free medicine, age pensions or free secular education but that the wealthy sections of the community can never be pauperized regardless of the generosity of gifts that a benevolent government may make available to them. For instance, in one swoop, this Government, during the current financial year, will remit to wealthy interests over £6,000,000 in land tax. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2938</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>- Order !

I  recognize fully the integrity of the  members  of the medical profession, but I  have no  higher belief in their integrity  than  I have in that of the members  of any  other profession. Some members  of themedical  profession adopt practices  that  are considered to be improper.  Price  splitting between specialists and  general'  practitioners has been known ever  since  there have been specialists and  general  practitioners in the profession.  Therefore,  I agree with the honorable  member  for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly)</inline> when he  said  that if committees are to be established  to  supervise or conduct a free  medical  scheme, the members of the  community  should be represented. He said that  they  should represent the consumers  or the  general public. In my opinion the  business  community should be  represented  also. After all, the medical  profession  has not a monopoly of interest in the  provision  of free medicine. The person  who  takes the medicine and the taxpayer  who  pays for it are as interested as the  chemist  who sells the medicine or the doctor  who  prescribes it. Therefore, any committees should be of a more general  character.  They should not consist only of  doctorsThe  Minister for Health  knows that  a big section of the  community  believes that doctors, because of  their  training, have not a general  aptitude  for finance or big business.  The  honorable member for Grayndler  recalled  that some ill-advised newspapers  oncedescribed  the present Minister for  Healthy  who was then the Treasurer, as "  thetragic  Treasurer ". Apparently,  thosenewspapers  thought that he was  one of  the members of the medical  profession  who did not have an aptitude for  business  or finance or the organizing ability  that  is so essential in the administration  of  at big scheme. I suggest that  any committee  to deal with a health  schemeshould  include laymen, not  merely so- that the  community shall have representatives, but also because the Opposition  believes  that the public should have absolute confidence in the scheme. If confidence is to be established, even the doubting Thomases, including those who write -articles for the newspapers about the  present  Minister for Health, must be convinced that the scheme is sound and properly administered. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I  commend the Government for having  :gone  so far as it has. It might be apt to  say  that the Government is taking socialism in little doses. As time goes on,  the  doses will become bigger and bigger,  not  because the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> desires it, but because of the inspiration that will come  from  this side of the House, and the impetus of public opinion. We have free -education to develop the mind, and, eventually, the people will demand free health services, free hospitalization and free medicine. After all, the body is as important as the mind. It is the basis  of the  mind. A sound mind in a sound  body  was the inspiration of the ancient Grecians and it should be the inspiration  of  modern democratic governments.  Only  when health, and all that pertains  to it,  is as free as secular education will  we  have reached the ideal that the Labour party is striving for. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2939</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JF7</name.id><electorate>Fremantle</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BEAZLEY, Kim</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name></talker><para>.- At  the outset I wish to congratulate the honorable member for Bennelong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Cramer) upon his speech. In the course of it he passed judgment on the negotiations that took place between the Minister for Health of the day, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> and the British Medical Association. So far as I am aware, the honorable member for Bennelong is the  only  member of this House, of the last Parliament or the Parliament that preceded it, who' ever discovered anything  about  the negotiations that took place  between  the former Minister for Health  and  the British Medical Association and  was  able to pass judgment. Nobody else  was  able to get any details while the Parliament was in session, and I have  found  it necessary always to suspend judgment before deciding who was responsible for the deadlock. The honorable member for Bennelong was equally incorrect in his comments on the endeavours of the Chifley Government to nationalize medicine. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> were the sole dissentient in the House on a celebrated occasion when a referendum bill was passed by 58 votes to one. You will remember that when the Chifley Government brought in a measure for a referendum on social services, the Leader of the Opposition of the day rose and asked that the words, "but not so as to authorize any form of civil conscription ", be added to the clause of the bill that dealt with medical schemes. The present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> who was Attorney-General in the Chifley Government, immediately accepted that amendment and it was written into the Constitution as a guarantee against the civil conscription of the medical profession when it was passed by the Australian nation at a referendum. If the Chifley Government had desired the nationalization of medicine, its action in writing a guarantee against it into the Constitution was plain folly or, alternatively, the statement of the honorable member for Bennelong was plain untruth. I believe that the latter is the case. </para></talk.start><para>In the course of the medical profession's attack in Western Australia upon the Chifley Government's medical proposals, it was not suggested, as some would have us believe, that the formulary was too wide or too loose but that it was not wide enough. Many Western Australians remember clearly advertisements that were inserted in the press at the time by the British Medical Association. One of the standard advertisements compared the slim volume of the formulary that was proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> with the thick volume of the <inline font-style="italic">British Pharmacopoeia.</inline> It was completely dishonest to compare the thickness of the books, because there are many hundreds of pages of advertisements in the <inline font-style="italic">British Pharmacopoeia,</inline> but the medical profession considered an argument of that type to be good enough. At any rate, I can make the point that they were suggesting that not fewer but more medicines should be made available free. At that time, it was not unusual for Labour members of Parliament to be approached by eminent members of the  medical profession. The impression that I gained from those who discussed the matter with the honorable member for Perth and me was that they were extremely cynical about the prescription of a great many drugs. I am sure that they approve of the action of the present Minister for Health in confining free medicines to those antibiotics that have been proved actually to destroy germs or to prevent their multiplication, and to drugs, such as insulin, that everybody accepts as being undoubtedly life-saving drugs. In private, the tenor ' of the remarks of the medical profession was that way, but in public it suggested that the Chifley Government formulary was very inadequate and should be widened. 1 hope that the honorable member for Isaacs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haworth)</inline> appreciated the speech that was made by the honorable member for Bennelong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cramer).</inline> 1 have never heard a mere mortal insultdirected at the profession to which the honorable member for Isaacs belongs than that which was uttered by the honorable member for Bennelong, when he said that until this scheme of the Minister for Health was put into operation, people died because they could not get life-saving drugs free. If the chemists actually refused to give life-saving drugs to people because they could not pay for them, the pharmaceutical profession must be a profession of moral lepers. If it is not - and 1 do not believe it is - the statement of the honorable, member for Bennelong was untrue. It was typical of the exaggeration that has attended statements by the Government about this bill. I know that lots of people, including age pensioners, who could not afford to pay for lifesaving drugs, received them from dispensing chemists in my constituency, not merely on one occasion but on many occasions. The truth is that the chemists had strung around their necks a debt which .worried them. The action of the Minister for Health in putting this scheme into operation has relieved them of that worry. It would be very depressing if it were true that, until the Government agreed to pay for these drugs, many people died because they had not the money with which to buy them. That is not the attitude that the Minister for Health has adopted in relation to the visiting experts to hospitals. He has often drawn our attention to the fact that they give their services free. I am certain that that argument of the honorable member for Bennelong was as untruthful as was the charge that the Chifley Government intended to nationalize medicine. </para><para>Some comment has been made upon the fact that the provision of these drugs will cost £7,000,000 a year. The honorable member for Bennelong suggested that that was a large, sum. It is a large sum, but it is very small in comparison with the £162,000,000 that was spent during last financial year in four States with licensed bookmakers; with the £150,S00,000 that was spent last year on beer, wine and spirits; with the £30,000,000 that was invested on  totalisators;  with the £12,500,000 expended upon lotteries; and with the £4,500,000 sent to Tattersalls. If we make an allowance for starting-price  bookmaking  in the other two States, we find that the total sum spent in those directions last financial year was over £600,000,000. Surely, it is justifiable to tax the community to pay for a necessary service when it can spend so much money upon totally unnecessary things. That is the relevance of the point that I am making. I am certain that, if the community spent less money in those directions, there would be less need for this expenditure of £7,000,000, but, if it results in a higher level of national efficiency, it will be justified. "We can talk about the cost of these life-saving drugs, but can we estimate the cost of ill-health in terms of hours of production lost? It is almost certain that, if a man quickly recovers from an illness because he has been treated  with,  say, penicillin, the expense to the community of providing that penicillin <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> more than offset by his early return to efficiency and productive work. If we adopt a strictly balance-sheet outlook to what is undoubtedly expenditure upon health, that outlook, more than any other, will justify that expenditure. Reference has been made to humane considerations which do not influence a large number of people, but, in terms of the balance-sheet, health expenditure is justified completely. </para><para>There are some categories of persons, such as the age pensioners, who are out of production, and who may be restored to health by the use of these life-saving drugs. I think that we have far too many age pensioners, in one sense. We stick, quite illogically, to a chronological retiring age instead of to a health retiring age. Many persons who are compulsorily retired, especially from the Public Service, should remain at work, because they Iia ve reached a high level of efficiency and their efficiency is unimpaired. Yet we adopt the foolish practice of pushing them out of production, thus making them very poor and dependent upon schemes such as this. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2941</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JXI</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">FREETH, Gordon</name><name role="display">Mr Freeth</name></talker><para>-  What has this to do with with the bill? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2941</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JF7</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BEAZLEY, Kim</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name></talker><para>- My reply to the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Freeth)</inline> is that if we had fewer pensioners, there would be less need for this kind of expenditure upon pensioners.

Many honorable members on this side of the House would like to see it go further than it does. Personally, I should not like to see the scheme extended to cover other forms of drugs until there had been n much greater Commonwealth expenditure upon clinics, hospitals and other needs more basic than prescriptions and Cottles of medicine. I should prefer the additional money to be expended in the direction I have indicated rather than for the restoration of the conception of a formulary envisaged by the previous Government. I think that the community as a whole would prefer that too, because hospital and clinic facilities are inadequate. Whether the Commonwealth allotted money to clinics and hospitals itself or gave money to the States to do so, I think that that should take priority of any restoration of the formulary. These life-saving drugs do not constitute a health scheme, but they constitute a part of a health scheme and, as such, they should be welcomed. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2941</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>C7E</name.id><electorate>'Cowper</electorate><party>CP</party><role>Minister for Health</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PAGE, Earle</name><name role="display">Sir EARLE PAGE</name></talker><para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - There is no reason why I should attempt to reply to the criticisms of the bill that have been made by members of the Opposition. Their confused and contradictory arguments, and their extraordinary statements, show that the altitude they adopted to the medical and pharmaceutical professions during the eight years that the Labour party was in power has not changed sufficiently for them to be able to evolve a full national health scheme. The basis of the criticism offered by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Allan Fraser)</inline> was that the scheme was costing more than £2,500,000 a year. The. honorable member for  Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson),</inline> on the other hand, wants to add to the list of free drugs and so increase the cost of the scheme. The honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> put the whole matter in its proper perspective by comparing the cost of this scheme which is saving many lives as well as hospital beds with what the Australian community spends on amusements. I assure honorable members opposite that the existence of this scheme has enabled costly anti-biotic drugs to be used in the most efficient and satisfactory manner. A medical practitioner is something of a father confessor to his patients. He does not want to overload their expenses. In' order that these lifesaving drugs may do their job properly, the bloodstream has to be filled with them. It is of no use only half doing the job. The drugs must be administered in the right quantities if they are to be effective. That is why they should be used only when absolutely necessary. Since the wonder drugs have come into use, many diseases which were almost invariably fatal in the days when I was a general practitioner may now be cured very quickly. They include, for instance, blood-poisoning after childbirth, which years ago was one of the most fatal diseases in the world. To-day, the death rate from that disease is practically negligible. The value of the drugs cannot be weighed in terms of a few pounds. Thousands of lives are being saved to continue in all sorts of useful activities not the least important of which is the bringing of children into the world. It would be false economy to cut our expenditure on those drugs. I agree however, that the expenditure should not be any  more than is absolutely necessary. The Government has endeavoured right from the inception of the scheme to keep the prescribing of free life-saving drugs under control. It is true that there is a tendency innate in human beings not to value things for which they do not have to pay. For that reason waste is likely to occur, and we must take every step to ensure that these drugs, many of which are scarce and very costly, are utilized in the best possible manner. That is why this measure has been introduced. It is not an afterthought. It has been introduced in accordance with the policy that I have always followed throughout my career in this Parliament. It has always been my aim to try to operate controls on a voluntary basis, but ultimately to give them statutory or constitutional authority if necessary. For four years, as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, I endeavoured to maintain the Australian Loan Council on a voluntary basis. Then, by a majority of four to one, the people of Australia inserted authority for the Australian Loan Council into the Constitution. The various committees which are connected with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme have been working on a voluntary basis for the last eighteen months. It is now my wish and the wish of the medical profession that they should be given statutory authority. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2942</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JF7</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BEAZLEY, Kim</name><name role="display">Mr Beazley</name></talker><para>- Could the scheme be extended to include blood transfusions? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2942</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>C7E</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PAGE, Earle</name><name role="display">Sir EARLE PAGE</name></talker><para>- Blood transfusion is a process rather than a lifesaving drug. We are helping the Australian Red Cross Society by facilitating the supply of blood and so ensuring that the blood transfusion service shall be as cheap as possible. I should like to correct a few misstatements that have been made. When I brought the original measure down in 1951, 1 said that its cost for the remaining nine months of the then current financial year would be £2,500,000. That estimate proved correct. However, it was quite obvious that with the addition to the free list of more new and costly drugs, the scheme would cost much more in ensuing years. Last year, the budget estimate was £5,000,000, but actual expenditure was £7,000,000. One reason for that was that from October, 1951, until January, 1952, we had one of the most serious virus epidemics ever known in Australia. During that epidemic new drugs saved the lives of hundreds and probably thousands of people. However, since that time, particularly during the last three or four months, with the assistance of the various committees, we have managed to bring down the cost of the scheme by no less than £100,000 a month. That saving has been due to a careful examination of the whole scheme. I shall refer to one or two items. I have no wish to detain the House at this stage. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2942</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K97</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">GALVIN, Patrick</name><name role="display">Mr Galvin</name></talker><para>- Hear, hear! </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2942</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>C7E</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PAGE, Earle</name><name role="display">Sir EARLE PAGE</name></talker><para>- The honorable member for Kingston <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Galvin)</inline> says, " Hear, hear ! " Every time this matter is raised, honorable members opposite complain that my explanations are not long enough, yet, when I endeavour to give a full explanation, they do not welcome it. Since the inception of the scheme, various controls have operated to make sure that the expense that would have to be borne by the people of Australia was justified. The first action taken was to establish a committee to advise on what life-saving and diseasepreventing medicines should be included on the free list. The honorable member for Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Peters)</inline> emphasized the need for prevention. We have not lost sight of that aspect of the matter. Our immunization services are free. The advisory committee to which I have referred has exercised valuable discrimination and control. I venture to say that the people of Australia have no idea of the debt that they and the medical profession owe to members of the committee. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> himself probably does not know the extent to which his revenues have been safeguarded by the activities of the committee in resisting the immediate inclusion on the free list of new and much publicized drugs which, after a short vogue, have been found to be unsuitable. Very often pressure is brought to bear to have such drugs included on the free list before they have been given an adequate trial or before the medical profession has had an opportunity accurately to gauge their effects. In a further attempt to reduce  .costs <inline font-style="italic">ian</inline> .-endeavour 'has  been   made ito encourage ?the  manufacture  of  anti-biotics  in  this  country to .ease ."the  strain  ..on  our  .dollar  resources  .and .to saf  feguard  supplies  should  (overseas sources be cut aif. .-As a .result rot :my interviews  with drug manuf acturers,  including some overseas (organizations, .our supplies .of  the  sulpha .drugs .are mow .being .made in .Australia. .Certain ingredients .still have to be .imported .but .the actual manufacture is .carried out "by .the Monsanto .organization .which distributes its products -to drug 'houses throu.gho.ut Australia. That has  resulted  in an extraordinary cheapening of the drugs. The .cost .of penicillin  has  been considerably reduced .also .by improved manufacturing technique and .by the .use of the total .output .of the manufacturers. The cost of ,5.0Q,0.00 units las been reduced since September, 19.5Q, from 6s. to 4s. 4d.

So it is not cora-.ect to say that the .drug houses are profiteering .at 'the expense of the  community.  As their manufacturing processes ito prove .and their output increases they are able to  give  the benefit of lower prices to the Australian people. The manufacturers themselves have agreed to the adoption of what is practically a flat rate for their products as they appear in the list under the various schedules. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is important that we should have these two committees operating.

                        <para>. - The Opposition does not intend to oppose this bill. It recognizes that this is an attempt on the part of the Government to face up to the realities of the day with respect to the exploitation and development of aboriginal reserves. The present policy of the Commonwealth and State Governments regarding aboriginals provides for the assimilation of the natives in the community. That policy has been confirmed by this Government and, as such, places in a peculiar position the policy of maintaining exclusive aboriginal reserves.  On the one hand, we have a policy of assimilation, and on the other hand, we have a system that indicates, at any rate, a policy of segregation. I believe that the action of the Government at this time is an endeavour to face up to realities brought about by that state of affairs. "We all agree that the retention of native reserves - that is, the reserves proclaimed from time to time for the exclusive use of the natives - is not now in the interests of the aboriginals themselves. The policy of assimilation has brought about that change. It is also in the national interest that the development of the reserves by persons other than the natives should be allowed. This matter has been brought to a head by the discovery of certain mineral deposits adjacent to the  Arnheim  Land reserve. At the time of the discovery, those deposits were thought to be outside the reserve, but subsequent developments proved that they were just inside it, and the indications are that the deposits are of such importance as to require development on a national basis. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Another matter with respect to aboriginal reserves concerns not only the natives but also Australia as a whole. I refer to the danger of having vast areas of land uninhabited by whites and natives. At the present time, vast areas of the reserves are uninhabited, or are only sparsely inhabited, by natives. It is not in the national interest that such a condition of affairs should be permitted to continue. I cite the Arnheim Land reserve, where some thousands of square miles of land are now locked for the exclusive use of aboriginals in that part of Australia. Some hundreds cf miles of coast line are exposed to tb.1 east and to the north, and are entirely unprotected. Under existing conditions, that coast line cannot be protected in . an' way. This vulnerability is a danger to the nation, and a threat to the natives themselves. Another attack on Australia, such as was experienced in World War II., could have disastrous results. Fortunately, we escaped the consequences of that policy in the last war, but it was more by good fortune than by good management that we did so. That state of affairs should be brought to an end. </para>
                    <para>Population is vitally needed in those areas for the protection of the natives, and Australia as a whole. Therefore, I believe that the time has arrived when we must consider the development of aboriginal reserves from the standpoint of not only the exploitation of mineral resources, but also the broader aspects of settlement and, indeed, the agricultural and pastoral use of those areas. I am aware that the interests of the natives must always be protected and I have no quarrel with that policy. That, I assume, is the view held by the Government in introducing this bill. </para>
                    <para>A few matters in the second-reading speech of the Minister for Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hasluck)</inline> require some clarification. For instance, a trust fund is to be established into which royalties from mineral resources are to be paid for the benefit of the natives. I should like the Minister to explain in greater detail than he has in his second-reading speech how this fund would be used. Is the money to be expended by departments under control of the Commonwealth, or will the missions act as agents on behalf of the Government in the distribution of the money? I should also like some clarification of the conditions under which prospectors will be allowed to go onto the reserves to search for minerals. I am wondering whether the Government proposes to allow the small man, who may not have a great deal of capital at his disposal, to search for minerals on the reserves, or whether the prospecting of those areas will be carried out by larger companies. Because of their financial position, the companies may be assumed to have a greater chance of locating minerals on those areas than have the small prospectors. I believe that, as long as a prospector can satisfy the administration about his character and ability to observe the conditions laid down by the Administration, he should be permitted, and encouraged, to go on to the reserves in an effort to locate minerals that may be hidden in them. The lone prospector is often in a position to do things that large companies are unable to do. The history of Australia reveals that the lone prospector has been more successful, on the whole, in locating minerals than have comparatively big organizations. </para>
                    <para>The Minister, in his concluding part of his second-reading speech, discussed the matter of allowing natives to prospect for minerals. His words were of such importance that I shall read them to the House. They are as follows: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In some quarters, the question has been asked why the natives themselves should not work  in  minerals that may be found on the reserves. In general, mining would he beyond the skill and the resources of most of the natives in the Northern Territory. If it should happen that any natives living in reserves show an interest and capacity for either prospecting or mining on those reserves, they will receive every possible help and opportunity to engage in this activity. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That approach is not sufficiently positive. I consider that certain selected natives in these areas should be given training in the mining of various ores. They should be .taught to identify ores of different types. Natives are able to render very valuable assistance in the exploration of likely areas and in the working of deposits that are known to exist on their reserves. At native settlements in north and central Australia provision should be made for the instruction of natives in the basic elements of mining. In the past they have located minerals in the north of Australia on various occasions but the finds have not always proved to be beneficial to them.. It would be in the interest of the natives themselves to teach them the rudiments of mining and to enlist their aid in initial developmental work. I shall be glad to hear the Minister's views on the points that I have made. The Opposition supports the bill. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - I shall reply briefly to the three points that were raised by the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson).</inline> First, the honorable member asked whether the fund which is to be established by the bill will be used only by government departments or instrumentalities or whether it will also, he used through the agency of the missions that are working among the natives. The intention of the Government, which is clearly expressed in the bill, is that the money shall be dispersed through the agency considered to be the most suitable for the purpose at the time of its disbursement. It is intended that the money shall be distributed through either existing institutions or institutions to be formed especially for the purpose, or through government departments, as seems to be appropriate in the circumstances existing at the time the disbursement is made. In an earlier statement on this subject, I made it quite clear that there was a prospect that the missions would also participate in the additional activities that are likely to result from the establishment of this fund. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The second point raised by the honorable member related to my statement that certain conditions would be attached to the permits of prospectors to go into aboriginal reserves, and to mining leases granted in respect of areas on aboriginal reserves. These conditions will not differentiate between a large company and a small prospector. They will be devised with the object of ensuring that the interests of the aborigines shall be conserved. To ' give a concrete example, some reserves may contain only limited surface water and this may be required to meet the needs of the natives. One of the conditions that would be attached to the issue of a permit or lease in such an area would be designed to conserve the water for the natives by prohibiting prospectors or miners from permanently camping near water which the natives customarily use. In some instances it may be necessary to restrict within a defined area the movements of prospectors by providing that they may work in one part of a reserve but not in another if by so doing they would disturb the customary tribal life of the natives in the reserve. In other instances, it may be necessary to lay down precise conditions to ensure that those working a lease shall not consort with the natives or establish undesirable contact with them. If we issue a permit to persons to enter native reserves we do not waive in any way restrictions which at present apply in relation to trafficking with natives, consorting with them or interfering with their way of life. If a mining lease is granted on a defined area there will possibly bo a prohibition against those working the lease going beyond the defined limit and intruding in other areas. These are the sort of conditions we have in mind and not ones which will differentiate between large influential mining companies and small prospectors. I emphasize that each case will be dealt with on its merits. In each instance the conditions laid down will be such as shall be warranted by the particular circumstances, the guiding principle always being the conservation of the interests of the natives and their protection from injury. </para>
                    <para>Finally, the honorable member referred to the possibility that the natives might be able to engage in prospecting and mining. I agree with almost every word that he said on that subject. It is certainly our hope that, as the natives progress in education and training and developinterests more closely in association with our own, they, too, will find in the development ofminerals in the Northern Territory one of the opportunities which they need to live a life more closely associated with the lives of the rest of the community. I was attracted to the honorable member's suggestion that we should educate the natives by training them in the identification of mineral ores. It will receive the attention of the Northern Territory Administration. I thank the honorable member for the understanding and sympathetic way in which, on behalf of his party, he has received this legislation. </para>

<para> At the 3rd October, 1952, the number of assisted Italian migrants in Immigration Reception and Training Centres awaiting initial placement in employment was 818. At the same time there were approximately a further 100 migrants in Department of Labour and National Service hostels. Of these some had previously been employed and were awaiting re-engagement. </para>
</item>
                    <item label="2.">
                        <para>All migrants who are accommodated at reception and training centres receive payment of a special benefit whilst awaiting placement in employment, which is equal in amount to unemployment benefit. Whilst this was at the rate of £1 5s. a week, £1 a week was deducted in the case of a single man towards the cost of his upkeep, leaving him with 5s. pocket money. Now that the amount of the benefit has been increased to £2 10s. a week, the migrant's contribution towards the cost of his upkeep will also be increased, but the <inline font-style="italic">amount</inline> has not yet been finally determined. Migrants previously employed and awaiting re-engagement receive normal unemployment benefit. From this they are expected to contribute towards current accommodation charges.</para>

                                <para>(b)The number of Italian assisted migrants under employment obligation, who are at present on the water, comprises an estimated number not exceeding 750 who were scheduled to leave Italy on the 25th September, by <inline font-style="italic">Castle Felice.</inline> These comprise thebalance of those to whom Australia was committed at the time of the review of the immigration intake, to which matter my colleague, the honorable P A. M. McBride, referred, as acting Minister for Labour and National Service, in his address to the House on the employment situation on the 7th August, 1952. </para>

                        <para>Reference has already been made in the House to the efforts begun by the Commonwealth Employment Service in March, 1952, to place experienced migrant rural workers on farms. This drive has continued and to date a number of vacancies have been obtained. Of these, approximately 2,350 have been filled by migrants, all but 200 being Italians. This drive is still continuing, and as practically all Italian migrants yet to arrive this year will he rural workers no great difficulty is anticipated in their absorption into primary industry. </para>
