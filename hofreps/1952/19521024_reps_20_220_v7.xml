                        <para>- I address to the Minister for Social Services a question which refers to persons in receipt of age pensions and who also hold government bonds. I have in mind particularly an old couple who have £1,500 worth of bonds. The market value of the £100 bond is at present £88. Where such bonds are deemed to be property in the possession of such persons, is the Minister prepared, in future, to assess the pension entitlement, not on the face value of the bonds which they hold, but on the market value ? </para>

                        <para>- When there is consistency in the market price of bonds, this question, does not arise, but when there is fluctuation in the market price there is, of course, need for assessment. Pensions are reviewed at specified periods. The current practice is to assess bonds at the market rate and not at their face value. That has been the consistent policy of the  department for many years. Of course, there would be instances, such as that to which the honorable member has referred, of persons who hold £1,500 worth of bonds which have not yet been reviewed. However, in all new cases the assessment is based on market value. If the honorable member is able to bring to my notice particular instances of the kind to which he has referred, I shall investigate them immediately and cause a review to be made straight away. </para>

                            <para>- The blind persons concerned will come under the medical services scheme applicable to age and invalid pensioners. Pensions became' payable to them immediately after the 2nd October. Naturally it is taking a little time to overtake arrears in respect of the new pensioners, of whom there are 4,200, but most of them have been dealt with. If the honorable gentleman knows of ' any trouble in relation to any particular case, I shall have it examined immediately. </para>

In view of the fact that the incomes of many superannuated officers of the Commonwealth and State services, who have provided for their old age by their savings, are little in excess of the age pension plus the amount of the permissible income, will the Minister consider extending to such persons the benefits of the free medical and free medicine schemes pending the implementation of his proposal to abolish the means test? </para>

In considering the honorable member's proposal we must consider whether we can afford such a scheme. The honorable member's proposal has great merit and justice, in it, but social services in Australia are now costing about £200,000,000 a year and all future payments of social services must be examined very closely. Further expenditure cannot be incurred without due regard to all the other commitments of the Commonwealth. The proposal of the honorable member has much merit in it and I shall be very pleased to examine it carefully to ascertain whether anything can be done in thu direction that he has indicated. </para>

Is it also a fact that the department's method of recouping itself for overpayments varies considerably. In some cases the full amount is obtained in one payment, and in other cases the over-payment is deducted from the pension in small amounts until the total is made up. "Will the Minister arrange to have overpaid amounts deducted on a uniform basis at a small flat rate and so prevent hardship in many cases ? </para>

                                <para>- It would be very difficult in practice to follow the pro posal made by the honorable member.' The  department is involved in certain overpayments to pensioners, some of which have been deliberately caused by misrepresentation. Some people have taken money_ to which they are not entitled. I have in mind the case of a man who received a tuberculosis pension, to which he was not entitled, for more than a year before the department discovered its mistake. He 'had earned substantial sums of money, and really he should have been prosecuted. In every case the social services legislation is administered in a most sympathetic way, and the department makes arrangements for repayments in every case by agreement between the department and the person concerned. If the honorable member has in mind a case in which he considers there is undue hardship, I shall be very pleased to investigate it. Generally speaking, the matter of repayments is arranged between the departmental officer or magistrate and the person concerned. </para>

                        <para>- The Department of Air, in conjunction with the Department of Civil Aviation, has been investigating the possibility of establishing an airport at Newcastle, and has been engaged in trying to define the area on which the airport could be constructed. Recently the two departments appointed a committee to investigate the matter. It decided that Hexham was too close to the Royal Australian Air Force station at Williamtown to permit the establishment of an, airport there. The committee is examining sites in the Newcastle area and will meet next week when it will deal with the question of whether some more suitable site can be obtained. The honorable  members  for Paterson and Newcastle are also interested in this matter. I shall let all the honorable members concerned have an answer to their questions about it as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>- Since the honorable gentleman asked me a question about this matter on the 15th October, I have obtained information regarding the activities of the station concerned. The station, which is operated on Thursday Island by the Queensland Department of Native Affairs is a radio-telephone station which is authorized to communicate with fifteen outpost stations established by that department in the Torres Strait area for the exchange of communications on matters relating to the business of the department. Talks of a general nature directed to the outpost stations are permitted, but neither the control station on Thursday Island nor any outpost station is licensed for broadcasting to the general public. The licences do not confer any right to broadcast political propaganda. It has been ascertained that the log of the Thursday Island station shows that it was used at 8.30 a.m., on Tuesday, the 30th .September, 1952, for a talk to all outpost stations, but the script is not available, as the licensees of such stations are not required to keep records of the texts of transmission. I am having further inquiries made into the matter so far a3 the questions raised by the honorable member relate to the conditions under which the licence was issued, and I will inform him of the result, but, as I have said, no record is kept of the script and therefore it. is impossible to give the honorable member information about it. </para>

I have not heard a complaint in recent months that members of the Air Force station at . Fairbairn airport have not received all items of their uniform, but I shall make inquiries and if I find any truth in the statement of the honorable member I shall have the matter rectified. I can assure the honorable member that national service trainees would not, under any circumstances, be penalized for failing to wear items of uniform that had not been provided for them. About a year ago there was some criticism that adequate quantities of uniforms had not been provided,- but I think that adequate supplies have been available in recent months except in the most unusual circumstances and I think that there is general contentment throughout the service. </para>

                        <para>- The situation in Iran concerns the United Kingdom and does not directly concern Australia. From time to time the views of the Australian Government on the situation in Persia have been communicated to the United Kingdom Government. I do nol tL ink that there is anything that I can usefully add to the account of this matter that has already been published. For the time being it might be out of place for me to intervene in a public discussion of a matter which directly affects the United Kingdom and not Australia. So far as the situation in Indo-China is concerned, as the honorable member knows, the Australian Government recently established a base at Saigon and is receiving reports on the situation in Indo-China. At present the offensive which is in progress against the French is developing in such a way as to give grounds for a great deal of anxiety. I shall consider the possibility, at a later stage, of supplying further information to the House on the situation in IndoChina. </para>

Is the Minister also aware that this proposal will reduce the average fortnightly earnings of a number of postmen in the metropolitan area of Melbourne by approximately 30s.? Will he issue instructions to the department that this proposed economy measure be dropped immediately, and that economies to be effected in the department in future shall not be at the expense of the living standards of a very loyal, hard-working and efficient section of the public service ? </para>

I point out, by way of explanation, that under that administration, the cost of prospecting i3 advanced to prospectors on certain terms, and is not repayable unless the properties are profitably worked. The advance varies from 50 per cent, to 90 per cent, of the cost, and is payable in respect of 34 different minerals. </para>

I assure the honorable member for Angas that, in the judgment of officers of my department, ample labour should be available either from Australians seeking work in those districts at the time, or from immigrants who will supplement the labour that is offering.

                            <para>- There may be one or two dismissals, but I suggest that the honorable member could have chosen more appropriate language. The policy of the department is to employ civilians when service personnel is not available for a job. As we are able to recruit more servicemen, the civilians who were temporarily engaged are put off. However, such dismissals have been comparatively few. Not many civilians have been employed at Garbutt, and I have no desire to put any one off if it can be avoided. The policy of this Government is to keep people in employment as far as is within its powers. That applies to the defence forces as it does in every other field of Commonwealth activity. However, I shall investigate the position at Garbutt and if I find that dismissals have been on a substantial scale I shall see what I can do about the matter. </para>

                        <para>- Answering a question asked yesterday by the honorable member for Darling Downs about the treatment of poliomyelitis, in connexion with which Sister Kenny has performed a service so notable that her practical work in the United States of America was commended by  President  Roosevelt, and has been praised recently in a book by John Gunther, the Minister for Health referred to reports on Sister Kenny's treatment made back in 1938 and 1939. I ask the Minister whether the matter will be reviewed, not in the prejudiced light of what was reported fourteen years ago, but in the light of the fact that Sister Kenny's treatment is now largely in use in other countries. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Not only did I refer to 1938 and 1939, but I also referred to recent investigations in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Everything that has been done in connexion with the disease of poliomyelitis by Sister Kenny or anybody else in the world is under constant review by the Federal as well as the State health authorities. I desire to pay a tribute to the work that is being done by the State health departments and by Australian doctors in that regard. I resent the imputation contained in the right honorable gentleman's question that we in Australia have been careless about dealing with poliomyelitis. </para>

                        <para>- My intention was to address my question to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, but as he just left the chamber as I got the call, after trying to get it for the last couple of days, I shall address it to the Treasurer. My question relates to the prestige of the Parliament. When the Government decided that the House should not sit yesterday morning in order to give to honorable members an opportunity to attend a ceremony of outstanding national importance in connexion with the Australian National University, did it ensure that honorable members would have a reasonable chance of gaining admittance to that ceremony? When I endeavoured to obtain admittance, I was told that only persons holding blue tickets would be admitted, and as I held a pink ticket I was refused admittance. Such treatment is an insult to members of this Parliament, which, after all, has made provision for the establishment of the university. In future, will the Government, when it arranges for the House to adjourn to a special hour in order to enable honorable members to attend a ceremony, ensure that they shall not be open to such insult as was offered to me? As I walked away from the hall in which the ceremony took place, I was informed that many chairs were still vacant, and, later, I discovered that other honorable members gained admittance by a side door. Is it proper that on such occasions members of the Parliament should be obliged to gain admittance to such ceremonies by a back door? Is that the sort of recognition that the Parliament expects to receive by a great national institution? </para>

                        <para>- I can sympathize with the point of view that the honorable member has expressed. At the same time, however, we must consider the other side of the matter. Honorable members will recall that originally the ceremony was arranged in the expectation that the weather would be fine. However, the weather was unfavorable, and it was impossible to accommodate the 1,400 persons who had been invited in a hall with a seating capacity for only 400. </para>

                        <para>- There can be no doubt, on a fair analysis of the production figures available, that a notable increase of output of all essential requirements has taken place. Whatever other criticism may be offered by honorable members opposite or by other persons of the Government's economic and financial policies, at least it can be said that the Government has converted the Australian economy from the milk-bar economy of earlier days to a sound economy, and has placed it on a basis that will make possible the progressive development of our production resources. </para>

Do such patients who may be in hospital for eight days receive benefit in respect of only four days? Does this mean, as the secretary of the New South Wales Private Hospitals Association has claimed, that private hospitals will be unable to accept as patients persons who are in receipt of workers' compensation ? </para>

                        <para>- I read the report that was published in this morning's press dealing with the matter that the honorable member has raised. Private hospitals have been brought into line with the amendments that were made in 1948 by the Government which the honorable member supported, and also to conform to the regulations that were proclaimed in 1947 with respect to the treatment in public wards of persons in receipt of workers' compensation. That, was done to meet a position that had risen owing to the fact that hospitals in New South Wales made a charge for treatment in public wards. I have made inquiries in order to ascertain the position of persons in receipt of workers' compensation and have been advised that if a patient was in receipt of workers' compensation amounting to, say, £10 10s. a week and the hospital charge amounted to £6 6s. a week, such a person would not be entitled to receive the full amount of the Government benefit. I am sure that the honorable member will agree with the view that was taken, not only by the Government  that he supported, but also by the State governments, which originally recommended that such action be taken, that hospital benefit should not exceed the actual charge made by a hospital. </para>

                    <para class="block">The right honorable gentleman is not always so secretive about the affairs of the Loan Council, because in Statement No. 5, which was printed as an appendix to his budget speech this year, he gave a digest of what had occurred at the meetings of the council in May and July, 1952. We want the Treasurer to give us another statement relating to the proceedings of the council at its meeting on Friday and Saturday of last week. Presumably, he does not intend to make such a statement until the budget is presented next year. This House is entitled to know just what happened last Friday and Saturday. The Treasurer has said that  he has nothing to add to the Prime Minister's statement. I should like to crave the indulgence of the House to read what the Prime Minister said so that honorable members may know just how little he did say - </para>

                        <para>As a result of the Loan Council discussions yesterday and to-day, the  Commonwealth  expects to approach the market on behalf of the States for a comparatively small loan in the latter part of November. Terms of issue will be decided later under normal Loan Council procedure. </para>
                        <para>Approval was given to several semi governmental borrowing proposals submitted by the States. Approximate dates were approved in several instances. Since most or all of these proposals involve underwriting negotiations, no further details can at present be published. A very useful discussion took place between representatives of the States and the Commonwealth on the general problem of stabilizing the loan market and restoring it to a full state of health. In this endeavour the States undertook to co-operate fully. </para>

                    <para class="block">I like the euphemistic style of the Prime Minister. I have to turn to the press to find out precisely what did happen. According to one newspaper, the Australian Government tried to press the State governments into agreeing to an increase of interest rates on government loans from 3$ per cent, to at least 4-j: per cent., and possibly to 4$ per cent. One press report stated - </para>

When the Treasurer announced the calling of a meeting of the Loan Council in November, 1951, he was certainly more communicative than he has been in connexion with this loan meeting. On that occasion he said that there had been strong suggestions from a number of quarters that the Government should make available central bank credit <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> finance public works programmes.

It: has no policy, no programme and no real faith in the future of Australia. What this Government certainly does not realize is that there can be no economic stability in any nation unless its currency is sound. That is a fundamental fact, and it is the duty of any government that cares for the welfare of its people to make sure that the soundness of ite  currency  is not disturbed. A currency cannot be described as being sound when there is a lack of public confidence in its future as well as in its stability, such as is being exhibited throughout Australia to-day. </para>

The little people of Australia cannot be blamed for not investing in government securities when they do not know what will be the value of. their investment twelve months hence. Instead of resolving the doubts of the people on what might happen, this Government is only increasing them. Its known desire for an increase of the interest rate is having a bad effect on the market value of all previous loans. The resentment that is felt by investors in recent loans is communicating itself to prospective investors in future loans. We are reaching the stage when even the small loan that the Government proposes to float in the immediate future in order to test the market might be under-subscribed. </para>

                            <para>- I have referred to the state of the loan market, and I am endeavouring to demonstrate a way in which the Government may lift the value of investments in previous loans. I submit that that is quite germane to the argument. What the people of Australia want - and I do not suppose the Treasurer will disagree with me on this matter - is a settled policy on loan raisings at low interest rates, and firm decisions that will restore the loan market to the position it occupied during the eight years that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> was the Treasurer of Australia. Every loan, whether it was a Liberty Loan, a Victory Loan or a Security Loan, floated in those eight years was a success. The total loan raisings amounted to about £1,500,000,000. We did not pay more than per cent., and generally we paid only 3 per cent, on the loans that were floated in that period. </para>

                    <para>Until about the middle of 1951, the loan market was fairly satisfactory, but it has become very disturbed in recent times. We have the feeling that this Government is deliberately trying to lift the interest rate. We think it is trying to raise the rate even to 4^ per cent. No more dangerous decision could possibly be made. Such a high rate of interest would have disastrous effects upon the happiness and well-being of the Australian people, and could retard the development of the nation. The development of' this nation is very necessary. In our view, it is an axiomatic truth that we cannot have full employment unless money is cheap. If money is dear, we shall have deflation and, through deflation, we shall have unemployment. The Leader of the Opposition made that point in the course of his budget speech. In our view, money raised at 4J per cent., 4^ per cent, or 4f per cent, is dear money. The only conclusion at which anybody can arrive is that the Government, by making money dear, hopes to inaugurate a policy of deflation which, in turn, will destroy full employment. A government that wants high interest rates does not believe in full employment. A high interest rate can have other baneful effects upon the community. It can stop development by retarding the establishment of companies engaged in new enterprises in connexion with essential works. It can also cause hardships- </para>

                            <para>. - The appalling speech which the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> has just made leaves me with really nothing to which to reply. Indeed, having regard to the subject that he discussed, his speech could not have been other than it was. The suggestion that the proceedings of the Australian Loan Council last week were detrimental to the interests of the Commonwealth and the States carries with it the supposition that those proceedings, which were held <inline font-style="italic">in camera</inline> as they have been held ever since the inception of the council, were made known to the honorable member. There is also the implication that the States acted in conjunction with the Commonwealth to the detriment of the interests of all parties concerned. I suggest that the appalling ignorance of the honorable member concerning this matter is more apparent than real. It should be remembered that he has been associated with a government which supported the Australian Loan Council, and that before he became a member of Parliament, he held an important position in the Department of the Treasury in Victoria. Consequently, I suggest that he knows why the Australian Loan Council was established and is aware also of the rules and regulations which have governed and guided its operations ever since its inception. </para>

                                <para>- Where could I obtain such information if not from the officer who is secretary of the council ? Before the Australian Loan Council was constituted under the provisions of the financial agreement and commenced to function in 1929, there had been in existence, from 1924, a voluntary loan council comprised of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurers of the States. According to the records, the meetings of that voluntary council were held <inline font-style="italic">in camera,</inline> announcements of its decisions being made by the  chairman  on the authority of the council. That is the procedure followed by the present body, which apparently adopted it from its predecessor without considering it necessary to record the fact. The Australian Loan Council, as the honorable member for Melbourne well knows, is part and parcel of the Constitution. It is governed and guided by a charter that was written into the Constitution by virtue of a financial agreement entered, into between the 'Commonwealth and the States. Under that charter the affairs of the council may be controlled by the six States, each of which has a vote. The Commonwealth has two votes and, in certain circumstances, a casting vote. I am bound, therefore, in all decency, to respect the confidential nature of the proceedings of the council just as the States are bound to treat their association with it as confidential so far as their respective parliaments are concerned. Consequently, there is nothing to answer in connexion with the claim that the proceedings of the council last week were detrimental to the interests of the Commonwealth and the States. </para>

                                <para>- In the first place the proceedings cannot possibly be known, or should not be known, and they are certainly not accurately known. The honorable member's attack, therefore, i3 merely an effort to extract from me, in answers to the mis-statements that have been made, information that might be politically useful to the Opposition. That attempt will not succeed. I did not come down in the last shower, and I shall respect my responsibility as  chairman  of the Australian Loan Council on behalf of the Commonwealth, and I expect the States to do the same and to co-operate in the best interests of the national economy. It is timely to remind the House of the Government's record in the last financial year in connexion with the problem of enabling the States to have loan funds which would otherwise have been denied to them. Last financial year the Government took the unprecedented course of assisting the States, quite distinct from any association with the Australian Loan Council, by underwriting the State loan programmes to such a degree that it involved itself in an obligation that added £153,000,000 to the budget. In other words, all the revenue obtained from the extra taxes that the Government reluctantly imposed was used solely to finance State purposes. </para>

Had the Commonwealth nol done so, a chaotic condition would have arisen. </para>

                                <para>- Of course it did. We have a responsibility to the people generally not to give the taxpayers' money away to the States or anybody else. In the current financial year the Government has taken an unprecedented course of action in order to assist the State loan programmes, and will contribute to loan raisings an amount of up to £135,000,000. It is high time that the Opposition recognized what this Government has done for the States, and ceased its carping .criticism about loan funds and their utilization. As  the Opposition has not made out a case, there is no case to answer and I have nothing further to add to my remarks. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purposes of this bill are, first, to make provision for the issue after the 31st December; 1952, of war death certificates and, secondly, to give continued effectiveness to war death certificates that have already been issued under the existing law.  Honorable  members will recall that, during the recent world war, it was found necessary to  make  some administrative provision for the issue of certificates of death of persons who died in circumstances arising out of war which made direct proof of death difficult. Regulations were accordingly made, first the National Security (Supplementary) Regulations and subsequently the National Security (War Deaths) Regulations, which had the effect of obviating the necessity of lengthy and expensive proof of presumption of death before a court. </para>
                    <para>The regulations provide that where a competent authority is satisfied that the death of a person occurred whilst on war service or in the hands of the enemy or in other circumstances attributable to war which rendered proof of death difficult, he may issue a certificate to the effect that the person specified in the certificate died or became missing on the date mentioned in the certificate. The regulations make the certificate prima facie evidence in all courts that the person named in the certificate died or became missing on the date mentioned. The Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act continues in force until the 31st December, 1952, the provisions of the National Security (War Deaths) Regulations. These regulations, as they stand to-day, provide for the certification of the death of persons engaged on war service, of civilians in New Guinea and Papua and of other civilians who died while in the hands of the enemy or in  other circumstances arising out of war which render proof of death difficult. </para>
                    <para>Although power exists under the Defence Act, through amendments made in 1949, to permit the issue of certificates of death in respect of members of the Defence Force who die while on service, no legislative provision will exist after the 31st December, 1952, to permit the certification of death of civilians who die or who have died as a result of enemy action. Certificates of death in respect of civilians as well as members of the Defence Force who died or who became missing during the 1939-45 war are still required from time to time and it is desirable, therefore, that there should be legislation after the 31st December, 1952, which will permit the issue of certificates of death in respect of civilians who may have died, or became missing, not only  during the 1939-45 war, but also during any period in the future when this country might be engaged in war-like operations, as it is at present in Korea. This bill gives effect to this need. </para>
                    <para>Provision is also required to give continued force and effect after the 31st December, 1952, to certificates issued under the regulations to which I have referred. Clause 3 of the bill enables this object to be achieved. I commend the bill to the House. </para>

                    <para class="block">The object of this bill is to make certain amendments to the Customs Act which are considered essential in order to remove doubts as to the validity of certain regulations and administrative procedures and to bring the act into line with present day commercial developments. The bill will also simplify procedures in the interests of those transacting business with the Department of Trade and Customs. In section 4 and in other sections of the act, references occur in relation to aerodromes appointed for the purposes of the act. The term "airport " is now used internationally and it is therefore considered desirable that the word " airport " should be substituted for " aerodrome " in section 4 and in other relevant sections. </para>
                    <para>Division 1 of Part IV. of the act provides that the specific goods enumerated in the division and all goods, the importation of which is prohibited by regulation, are prohibited imports. In addition certain sections of division 1 are either redundant or are similar in effect to other sections of this act and of the Copyright Act 1912- 1950. It is therefore considered desirable to repeal and re-enact the whole of the division and the effect will be that goods which are prohibited imports will be prescribed in the regulations. It has been found necessary in certain circumstances to issue import licences subject to certain conditions to be fulfilled after importation, for example, that the goods will not be sold within a specified time. Experience has shown that when import licences have been issued subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions after importation and such conditions have not been met by the importer the Department of Trade and Customs has no power to enforce the conditions nor has it any right of action against the goods or the importer. It is proposed therefore to amend the act to provide the necessary powers to issue import licences subject to certain conditions to be fulfilled after importation and to enable the taking of securities to ensure that the conditions upon which importation has been allowed will be complied with. </para>
                    <para>Under section 97, warehoused goods may be removed from the warehouse for the purpose of public exhibition as prescribed by regulation. It has been found impracticable to deal with such matters expeditiously by regulation. Amendment of the section will enable collectors of customs to approve the quantities and specify the periods which the owner may retain the goods outside the warehouse without entering the goods for home consumption. </para>
                    <para>Section 132 provides that all import duties shall be paid at the rate in force when the goods are entered for home consumption. As it is not practicable to apply that section to stores in ships and aircraft owing to the fact that they are consumed before they can be entered for home consumption, it is proposed to add a new section in Part VII. to provide for the acceptance of duty at the rates in force on thedate the declaration of stores consumed is signed. As Part VII. is considered unsatisfactory from a drafting point of view this amendment provides an opportunity to repeal and remake the part. The provisions of the proposed Part VII. will not alter any of the existing practices relating to the control of such stores. </para>
                    <para>The amendment of section 162 will enable security in lieu of a deposit of duty to be given to the customs authorities that goods imported into Australia will be reexported within a period of twelve months. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> It is proposed also that the period during which the goods may remain in Australia may be extended at the discretion of the Minister. The insistence upon a deposit of duty and the inability to extend the period beyond twelve months have proved unduly onerous to importers in certain circumstances. </para>
                    <para>A new section 234a has been included in the bill whereby unauthorized persons may be refused entry to any ship, aircraft, wharf or place where passengers are being cleared through the customs until such time as the necessary customs formalities have been completed. Experience has shown that the presence of unauthorized persons hinders the speedy clearance through the customs of passengers and their baggage and is an obvious aid to smuggling. In this connexion it has been found imperative particularly with immigrant ships to control the many visitors who come to the wharfs to meet their friends. </para>
                    <para>The Customs Tariff authorizes the Minister to make by-laws under which, goods are admitted at concessional rates f duty. Numerous applications for entry of goods under by-law are received, necessitating in many instances, inquiries in Australia and the United Kingdom to determine whether the goods are entitled to the benefits of by-law admission. It is frequently the. case that, before a by-law is gazetted, the goods have arrived and are entered at the normal rates of duty. A subsequent refund of the difference between the duty paid under the normal tariff item and that due under the by-law enables the importer to obtain the full benefit of the tariff concession. As there is doubt as to the authority in section 163 to pay such refunds it is proposed to amend the section to authorize these payments. </para>
                    <para>In isolated cases, the situation also arises that a by-law item under which the goods would have been eligible for entry has been repealed before the by-law could be gazetted. The inability of the Minister to make by-laws in such circumstances imposes severe hardship on importers and it is therefore proposed to insert a new section 271 which will provide, <inline font-style="italic">inter aiia.</inline> that a by-law may be made in respect of any item of the Customs Tariff in vela. tion to any goods entered for home consumption during the continuance of that item, notwithstanding that the item, has been repealed prior to the making of the by-law. </para>
                    <para>The remaining amendments are of minor importance and are designed to simplify certain customs procedure in the interests of those transacting business with the Department of Trade and Customs and also to authorize various practices which have been operating satisfactorily in the past. These are - <inline font-style="italic">(a.)</inline> Section 43: To enable negotiable instruments to be accepted as security in lieu of cash. </para>

                <para>As the requests now before the committee are directly related to each other, I propose to deal with them as a whole. The principal amendment is contained in request No. 3. The other two requests cover what may be termed formal machinery amendments, which will be  necessary if the requested amendment to the schedule to the bill, that is request No. 3, be made. The Customs Tariff Bill 1952, to which the requests relate, was considered by this committee a short time ago. The duties imposed under that bill on carpenters' planes wholly or principally of metal, classifiable under item 219(c)(2)(c), are, British preferential tariff,  free ; intermediate tariff, 7^ per cent.; and general tariff, 12£ per cent. Since the bill was prepared, a report by the Tariff Board in respect of those items has been considered by the Government. The board recommended that a British preferential tariff of 17£ per cent, be imposed in order to protect the Australian metal plane industry. The Government decided to adopt the board's recommendation, and, as the measure containing the particular item concerned was then before the Parliament, the opportunity was taken to request that the duties be varied forthwith so that there would be no delay in according protection to local manufacturers. As it would not be practicable to impose the new duties prior to the date on which the request for the amendment was made, it is necessary to make provision both in the schedule and in the clauses of the bill for the imposition of the duties on and from the date specified in the requested amendment. I commend the requests to honorable members, and I suggest to the honorable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> that as the proposal is to give added protection to an Australian industry, he might be prepared to permit the requested amendments to be made forthwith. </para>

                        <para>. - I rise to support this bill. ] have followed the course of the debate with some despondency because I have heard members of the Opposition whom I know to be sincere and honest opponents of communism, taking a line which, although perhaps against their own inclinations, nevertheless gives aid and comfort to the Communists. When honorable members such as the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison),</inline> the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clarey),</inline> the honorable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson),</inline> and the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. W. M. Bourke),</inline> whom I believe in my heart to be not favorably disposed to Communists, feel constrained merely because they happen to be members of the Labour party, to get up in this House and say things which help the Communist cause, it is reason for the very greatest despondency. It suggests that there is in the Labour party, a Communist infection which is so deep seated that it perverts the reasoning and actions even of those individual members whom I believe to be personally opposed to the Communist cause. In the course of my remarks I hope to amplify what I have, said on that subject. I propose first to recapitulate the four main purposes of the bill, some of which may have passed from the general attention of the House in the welter of debate. First, the bill permits a ship in certain circumstances to put to sea with only four-fifths of  it3  normal complement. Therefore, a vessel will not be delayed by the absence of one or two men. Secondly, the bill abolishes the Maritime Industry Commission, and arranges for its functions to be carried out in another and more normal way. Thirdly, the bill adopts, in general, the principles of discipline that have been approved by the Maritime Industry Commission, and gives to the seamen a new right of appeal. Fourthly, the bill deals with the matter of accommodation for crews on ships. I shall not touch upon all those matters. However, I do intend to follow the nerve of the arguments that have emerged in the course of this debate from both side of the House. Both sides have freely admitted that one of the most important factors in the shipping  industry to-day is the influence of the Communists inside it. That is not a mere matter of chance. Anybody who has read the edicts issued by the Cominform, knows something of the general line of propaganda that emanates from Moscow; or if he looks at the cartoons and pictures that pour forth from Soviet sources, he will agree that it is a very great part of Stalin's war plan to try to paralyse transport in the democratic countries. There is a special Communist drive to take charge of transport unions, and particularly to impede shipping so that, in the event of war, adequate sea transport would not be immediately available to the enemies of the Soviet, and indeed so that even before war occurs, the arming of the democracies against Soviet aggression may be hampered. Coming to Australia, we find that view echoed in the official publications of the Communist party. I shall read from the <inline font-style="italic">Communist Review</inline> of July, 1952. An article written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline><inline font-style="italic">F.</inline> Hill, who, as honorable members know, is connected with the Communist party in Victoria. He wrote - </para>

Obviously we aim to raise each aspect to the highest possible understanding, to the highest possible level and. of course, proceeding beyond the peace struggle into a consciousness of the struggle for revolutionary power. . . . (We should)  . . develop these tactics to the level, for instance, that they have been developed in Italy and France, extremely high levels. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the link between the general Communist line in Moscow and the Australian Communist party. I shall now trace the link between the Communist party and the Seamen's Union of Australasia. T have before me a document which will surprise and appal the country, even though it may not surprise and appal honorable members opposite. I shall read from the <inline font-style="italic">Seamen's Journal,</inline> which is described as the official organ of the Seamen's Union of Australasia. This copy is dated March, 1952, and it contains an official report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott's</inline> speech at a meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott</inline> is a member of the Maritime Industry Commission, which is referred to in this bill. He is also a leading member of the Communist party, and has long been engaged in treasonable and traitorous activities. Among those activities was his recent visit to a meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, a Communist stooge organization which held a conference in Berlin. He appeared before that conference, which was convened and controlled by our enemies, and made certain statements. I hope that honorable members will realize the import of his exact words, which I shall read from this official journal of the Seamen's Union of Australasia. He is reported to have said - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is a completely shameless boast as reported in a Communist official document published by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott's</inline> own union - a boast made in Berlin at a meeting convened and controlled by our enemies. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott</inline> boasted that he had carried out the instructions that he had received from Budapest to the effect that no Australian ship should carry supplies to our troops in Korea. Inquiries that I have made lead me to believe that he has indeed been able to carry out that boast. 1 believe that to date it has been as he has said. Our men have not been given the backing of Australian ships, and I believe that it is true that their supplies have been reduced and impeded by the Communists in the Seamen's Union of Australasia in exactly the same way as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott</inline> boasted they would be reduced and impeded. If that is not treason - and it may not be technically treason under our laws - it is high time that the law was amended to make it treason. I can imagine no statement that could be more treasonable or more dastardly in intention. Our soldiers are fighting and dying in Korea, but this man says, " I shall see that they are isolated. I shall see that supplies do not reach them. I shall see that more of them are killed by the Communist aggressors, who are my friends, because I am on the side of the Communists ". I invite the attention of the House to ;the meaning of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott's</inline> statement, and I invite the House to consider what action should be taken about it. One thing that can be done is to remove the man Elliott from his position in the Maritime Industry Commission, and 1 am gratified to note that this bill at least will do that. I wonder whether it will do enough, and I wonder whether the actions of the Seamen's Union of Australasia do not raise issues that lie outside the ambit of this bill. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Port Adelaide, whom I may say once again 1 do not believe to have Communist inclinations, said some misleading things yesterday which must have helped the Communists. He asked why we should condemn people who have perhaps ten anti-Communists on the executive of their union and perhaps only one Communist. The truth of the matter is that the Seamen's Union of Australasia is controlled by Communists, and of that I could offer no greater proof than that contained in the journal of the union itself. I invite honorable members to study copies of this journal; they are all in the Parliamentary Library. If honorable members do so, they will find that there is no occasion on which that journal deviates from the Communist party line. There are plenty of occasions on which it abuses Great Britain, the United States of America and Australia and their allies, but there is not one single occasion on which it takes the British or the Australian side against the Russian. This journal of the Seamen's Union of Australasia is a Communist propaganda organ. The Seamen's Union of Australasia has not just one Communist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott,</inline> among a lot of non-Communists on its controlling body. That union is Communistcontrolled, and although I know that not all the seamen are Communists, and that among the rank and file there is an overwhelming majority of decent men, nevertheless while they allow themselves to be bossed about and controlled by this gang of Communists they are in danger of forfeiting the name of decent Australians. Can honorable members imagine that there are people who would allow their union and their actions to be controlled by men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott,</inline> who says, " It is our business to cut off and isolate the Australian troops in Korea and ensure that they shall be killed " ? But again I remind honorable members that that is what has happened. Therefore, the honorable member for Port Adelaide misled the House, perhaps in innocence and ignorance, but, nevertheless, in the interests of the Communists. Much of the material that this journal publishes suggests that it is opposed to arbitration ' and to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Its July issue contained an article that was headed, " Faith in Court a Fallacy ", and its October issue an article headed, " Seamen Fight the Court ". There can be no doubt about the nature of the editorial policy of that journal. </para>
                    <para>There is a sinister trinity in the maritime industry - Ernie Thornton, who has gone to China and is doing the enemy's work in that country, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Healy,</inline> of the Waterside Workers Federation, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott,</inline> of the Seamen's Union of Australasia, who are doing the enemy's work in Australia. Such a position is intolerable. This measure will do two things that will help to diminish the influence of the Communists in the maritime industry. First, it will dissolve the Maritime Industry Commission and transfer its powers to proper arbitral hands. As I have already pointed out, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott,</inline> this enemy of Australia, has been for a long time and still is a member of the commission, on which he represents his union whose members, to their shame, appointed him to that position. It may be that he does not exercise authority as a member of the commission, but it is obvious that as this enemy is a member of the commission it can neither enjoy the confidence nor command the respect of the community. Without knowing anything about what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott</inline> is doing in this matter, the fact remains that no Communist can be relied upon to keep his word. Every Communist will betray any information that comes into his possession in the course of his duty as a member of such a body. Indeed, a devout Communist would confess that he was obliged to behave in such a manner. Consequently,' whilst the commission is constituted as it is at present and while the Seamen's Union of Australasia elects <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott</inline> as its representative on that body, the Communists and agents of the Kremlin in Australia are made aware of everything that occurs before the commission, and are thus well placed to make good their boast that no Australian ship shall be used to help our forces in Korea or in any operation that is opposed to the plans and designs of Soviet Russia. That objective is of some consequence at present in view of the thrust that the Communists are making into French possessions in SouthEast Asia, a thrust that may come near to Australia sooner than honorable members may  believe. In view of the delays that are being caused to shipping and also of the fact that the Maritime Industry Commission has a traitor inside its doors, we cannot afford to allow that body to continue to exist. </para>
                    <para>The bill also provides that, in certain circumstances, a ship may put to sea with only four-fifths of its complement. Honorable members may not realize the degree to which the Communists have been able to use the device of deploying a few members of a ship's crew in order to prevent it from sailing. That is a device that is. particularly suited to minority control. Let us accept the dictum of honorable members opposite that only a fraction of the members of the Seamen's Union of Australasia are Communists. I believe that that is the truth; but so long as the law provides that a ship may not sail without a full complement, the Communist minority in the union will have the power to dictate to the loyal majority. </para>
                    <para class="block">Do honorable members opposite suggest that in the future we should continue to play into the hands of the Communists as we have done in the past? I thought that it was unworthy of honorable members opposite to try to buttress the Communist cause by raising silly bogies about the safety of passengers. The honorable member for Fawkner offended in that respect. I have no doubt that he did not understand the full implication of what he said. The argument he advanced was perhaps put into his mind by some underground means; but the House should realize the way in which, inside the Australian Labour party, the Communist infection is able to seep even into nonCommunist minds. </para>
                    <para>During the last 24 months, on the Australian coast, 361 ships have been delayed and 4,237 ships-days lost by tactics of this character, and even during the last three months 32 vessels have been delayed. I have a list of those hold-ups with notes explaining the reasons for them, but I shall not weary the House by reading it. I shall not even ask for leave to incorporate it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard ,</inline> but I shall make it available to any honorable member who wishes to peruse it. </para>

                            <para>- It was compiled by officers of the department from official records. However, I shall inform honorable members of the circumstances of the dispute that occurred on <inline font-style="italic">Dubbo.</inline> On the 25th March last, owing to a crew dispute that was originated by the firemen, that vessel was tied up at Port Adelaide with a full cargo of wheat that was urgently needed in Tasmania. The vessel was delayed by 33 days and the operating loss to the Australian Shipping Board for the voyage was £22,640. The firemen alleged that the bunker coal supplied to the vessel was of inferior quality. The Australian Shipping Board had samples of the coal analysed. After the dispute was brought before the conciliation commissioner and it was shown that the coal was of somewhat better than average quality and that, in fact, the same coal had been taken by two other ships, one before and one after <inline font-style="italic">Dubbo,</inline> and the crews of those ships had made no demur, the men shifted their ground and alleged that the  boilers  and machinery were in an unsatisfactory condition. The matter was considered by the conciliation commissioner who, after a long, patient hearing, determined that the coal was of reasonable quality. The ship was taken to sea with the union secretary on board for the purpose of observing whether its engines were in a satisfactory condition. Of course, the engines were shown to be in a satisfactory condition, and it was made clear that no ground whatever had existed for the union's complaint. In similar circumstances one complaint after another can easily be trumped up. They need not have any substance. Any one can invent a complaint and allege that the safety of the crew is involved ; and in present circumstances nothing can be done to stop such practices because a small minority is always in control in the union. T do not pretend that the bill will entirely remedy that position but it will alleviate it, and in so far as it will achieve that objective it should commend itself to all honorable members who favour majority control and genuinely oppose minority control by the Communists in the unions. </para>

                    <para>Finally, I desire to make a most  important  point that arises out of the remarks of the honorable member for Bendigo who said, in effect, "Yes, lint these things are done by the union. If the union does them, the men must follow ". I ask the House to consider the import of the principle enunciated by that honorable member. He said, in effect, " You must not punish the men because it is the union which is doing this, and the union's word must be followed ". If that is so, and if the Seamen's Union is controlled by the Communists, as in point of fact it is, what the honorable member virtually says is that the Communists must control Australian shipping; that the minority, which is able to hold up a ship, should be given power to dictate to the majority; and whether he means it or not, he plays into the hands of the Communists. I invite the House to consider whether this inviolability of trade unions - the belief that a union is always right and that everything it does is sacrosanct - is compatible with the maintenance of our arbitration system. That feature of trade unionism is assisting the Communist party because it provides that party with a handle with which it controls the trade unions. I know that persons who hold this belief are not always Communists; but unfortunately they give to the Communists power to control trade unions and, through the trade unions, not only the economy of Australia but also the exercise of its defence powers. I refer the House to the boast that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott</inline> has been able to make good, that by the use of his industrial power, exercised on the instructions of the Budapest conference, he has been able to prevent Australian ships from carrying supplies to our men in Korea. What shall we say of the remarks of the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison),</inline> a man who I believe is sincerely antiCommunist ? The honorable member has asked why the Government has not the courage to do more than it is doing. I agree that that is a fair question. I believe that the Government should be doing and should have done more, but the Government would require less courage and would have less difficulty in doing more, if it had the support of honorable members opposite in its actions against the Communists. It is difficult to act against the Communists because, when any measure that impinges on Communist control is introduced, whether in this House or elsewhere, it is too often opposed by Opposition members and their supporters. They may offer a variety of reasons for their opposition. They may pretend that their industrial or socialist objections go to the very root of the matter; but whatever the reasons may be, the fact remains that honorable members opposite act as a protective screen around the Communist party. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> requesting that the bill be withdrawn pending full inquiry into this proposal to alter the provisions of the Navigation Act. I do not claim to know all about the shipping industry, nor do I profess to know as much about the Communist party as does the honorable member for Mackellar, who seems to be so well informed about it that we do not know hen close he is to it. But I do profess to know something about arbitration procedure and the value of round table conferences as a means of ironing out matters in dispute before they go to a judge or to a conciliation commissioner. Prior to my election to this Parliament, I was a member of nine wages boards in South Australia established under the industrial code of that State which is one of the most efficient pieces of machinery for dealing with industrial disputes with which I have ever been associated. I appeared before all the judges of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court sitting both in single jurisdiction and as a Pull Court. I also appeared before the two arbitration court judges in South Australia, all of the conciliation commissioners and the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator. Industrial disputes can be more quickly settled by the parties discussing their differences at round table conferences than by presenting their cases to industrial tribunals. In making that statement I do not intend to show any disrespect for the members of the judiciary or the conciliation commissioners. As you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Acting Deputy Speaker,</inline> well know, because you were a member of a wages board, industrial disputes can be more quickly settled in the more friendly atmosphere of round table discussions between the parties at which lawyers are not present to raise legal technicalities. It is because of that fact that I fear the provisions of this measure, which will permit industrial disputes to be heard by a single judge, will not have the desired effect. </para>

                        <para>- On a question of procedure, I wish to advise the House that three other bills will be associated with the second-reading speech on this measure. They are the Air Navigation Charges Bill 1952, Australian National Airlines Bill 1952, and the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Bill (No. 4) 1952. It seems to me that if we can have one second-reading debate embracing all of these bills and then subsequently take the bills separately in the committee stages, procedure in the House might be facilitated because the complete story may then be told in the second-reading speeches of honorable members on this bill without the debate being broken into a series of bits and pieces. I think that the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> will agree with that procedure, and if you are in agreement, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I suggest that that course be followed. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill seeks the approval of Parliament to an agreement made by the Government with Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. That agreement proceeds from this Government's belief that, under conditions of competition, the best services will be provided to the travelling public. Its aim is to ensure that the major air services flown by these two companies are conducted under conditions of fair and active competition. </para>
                    <para>Civil air services were pioneered in Australia in the 19-20's over 30 years ago on the west and north-western coasts of Western Australia and in central Queensland. The pioneering activities of Western Australia Airways and Qantas Limited have been continued by successive Australian companies and Australia owes a great debt to those air transport operators who are continuing to provide services through extensive networks in the outback areas of Australia. It is convenient at this point to say that they receive every assistance possible from the Government. I want to pay this tribute to those services. Since this bill is concerned primarily with two principal operators of trunk services between the capital cities, my remarks will refer principally to Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, but I do not want it to be thought for one moment that the Government fails <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> appreciate the tremendous value of the smaller but vital services conducted by other operators. </para>
                    <para>The growth of civil air transport in Australia has indeed been amazing. The first trunk route between the capital cities was developed only in 1932 and it was late 1936 when all capitals were linked by interstate services. In 1939 the regular internal air transport services were flying approximately 45,000,000 passenger miles a year. During the war the civil airlines maintained considerable domestic services although large numbers of aircraft had been diverted to operate with the defence forces. By 1944-45 approximately 130,000,000 passenger miles were being flown on regular routes. By June, 1946, this had increased to 228,000,000 passenger miles. It was at this point that Trans-Australia Airlies entered the field. </para>
                    <para>The increase in popular demand for air transport continued and for the year ended on the 30th June, 1952, 756,000,000 passenger miles were flown. But it is really no surprise that flying has become </para>
                    <para>Much  a popular mode of transport in Australia. We have tremendous distances to cover between our main points of population ; and we have remote but economically important areas outside our main cities which require speedy transport. In addition our weather is probably the best flying weather in the world. As a nation we have grown up with aviation and have built up a great tradition in aviation. Among the pioneers, we are proud to number Hargraves. From the days of the Royal Australian Flying Corps in World War I. through the pioneering flying of the 1920's and the 1930's and in the tremendous air-borne attacks of the 1939-45 war, this nation has produced a band of intrepid flyers out of all proportion to its small population - small when compared with the great powers of the world. But in the middle of the twentieth century, when flying has developed to a precise art, civil air services are important because of the widely scattered nature of this continent. They possess a greater flexibility than other forms of transport. We know civil air services are now a vital and indispensible part of Australian life and the Australian economy. I shall quote one figure to illustrate the importance of civil air transport in Australia. The United States of America is popularly regarded as possessing the most highly developed air services in the world. Yet the number of passenger miles a bead of population flown in Australia is far in excess of that in any other country. It is 50 per cent, greater than that of America. </para>
                    <para>In our important air transport industry, the large part of the services - 85 per cent. - are provided by the two major operators, Trans-Australian Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. For the year ending the 30th June, 1952, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited flew 277,000,000 passenger miles and TransAustralia Airlines flew 320,000,000 miles. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited flew 14,000,000 freight ton miles and Trans-Australia Airlines flew 7,500,000 such miles. Australian National Airways Proprietary  Limited's  fleet consisted of nine D.C.4's, 27 D.C.3's and three Bristol freighters, while the fleet of Trans-Australia Airlines consisted of four D.C.4's, five Convairs, 24 D.C.3's and ten smaller types. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited came into existence in its present form in 1936 and it was as a direct result of the formation of the company in that year that the interstate network joining all capital cities and providing Australia with a civil air transport service from Cooktown in the north of Queensland to Perth in Western Australia came into being. It was Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited which had, by the outbreak of war, established the aircraft as a major mode of transport between the capital cities in Australia. It was Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited which during the war, apart from providing aircraft for service with the defence forces, maintained a network of trunk services in Australia which was of inestimable value as a line of communication between the various head-quarters of our forces, particularly in the critical year of 1942. And it was under the aegis of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited that the public demand for air transport had risen so much that with the advent of TransAustralia Airlines in 1946 the climate was right for the growth of these two major airlines to serve the needs of the Australian people. Both Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited are fine airline's - among the finest airlines in the world - and they can each take pride in the fact that they give to the Australian public air services which are, I think, unanimously regarded as being among the finest internal air services in the world. Yet the melancholy fact was, that despite its long history in  Australian civil aviation, despite its contribution to the development of air services in Australia, despite its part in forming the public demand for air services, and despite the fine service it was providing for the Australian public, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited had been running at a loss on its internal, services for some years. At the same time,. Trans-Australia Airlines was showing a profit, due entirely to the monopoly of air mail revenue which it enjoyed. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was in the difficult position that it needed new equipment and in particular it needed to order the latest passenger aircraft if it was to provide competition on Australian air services. </para>
                    <para>As honorable members know, the cost of new civilian aircraft is now very high. The modern aircraft is a complex machine, and the capital investment demanded of an air transport company is great. The directors of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, therefore, approached the Government and proposed the amalgamation of TransAustralia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. They said it was not possible for the two airlines to compete on a profitable basis and that a single entity was the only possible way of conducting civil air services within Australia. Indeed I believe that this proposal was first advanced by the company to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> but the proposal came to nothing during his term of office. When the company renewed this proposal to the present Government, we rejected it. We are opposed in principle to monopoly and we will seek to avoid it wherever we can. We believe that competition between Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines has produced advantages to the travelling public and has assisted in the creation of a technical efficiency of operation which it was the duty of the Government to maintain. It followed on our line of argument that both Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and TransAustralia Airlines must be retained as the major operators of air transport in Australia. </para>
                    <para class="block"> I said earlier that the Australian internal air services were the finest in the world. Their excellence was, in the Government's opinion, due on the part of each organization to the competition which the other provided. In such conditions of active competition,  neither  organization for one moment could sacrifice its standards one iota; it knew that if it did so it would lose business to its competitor. The Government believed that it was its duty to ensure that the excellent services provided by the two operators should be maintained for the benefit of the Australian people. The main principle of our policy in civil aviation is to ensure that civil air services are provided domestically under conditions of fair and active competition. But active competition could not be maintained if one of the two competitors had a precarious existence, which depended on the policy of the government of the day. The very uncertainty in this situation had led Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to a point where it was, as I have said, operating at a loss and would have been faced with great difficulty in raising its capital requirements to re-equip its fleet in the course of the next two or three years. No major airline, whatever its ownership, can operate on a basis of year to year existence. Its very nature requires that it be in a position to plan ahead for ten or fifteen years. Aircraft must be ordered some years ahead, and when they are obtained the operator must be able to foresee sufficient years of profitable operation to ensure that the investment will be recouped. </para>
                    <para>As I have said, the chief principle of the Government's policy was to maintain these two major operators, TransAustralia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited in existence to provide internal air services under conditions of active competition. To this end the first step that the Government took was to arrange for an independent analysis of the financial structure and operating costs of both airlines on a basis of strict comparison. This analysis revealed that after a period of losses, and despite a broad equality in popularity with the travelling public, the. figures were as follows : - </para>
                    <para class="block">For the period of six months to the 31st December, 1951, Australian Airways Proprietary Limited's loss was £201,775. This analysis also revealed that TransAustralia Airlines possessed one very great advantage over its competitor. Trans-Australia Airlines possessed, as J have said, a virtual monopoly in the carriage of airmail. While Trans-Australia Airlines was receiving an annual amount of something over £500,000 a year for the carriage of mail, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was receiving something under £50,000. </para>

                            <para>- It is all right for those who are in favour of monopolies, particularly socialist monopolies. TransAustralia Airlines also possessed a monopoly of business transacted on government account. As honorable members know, they could travel by air to attend the sittings of this Parliament only on the aircraft of Trans- Australia Airlines ; they were precluded from travelling on the aircraft of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. </para>

                    <para>I stress again the main principle of the Government's policy which -was to see internal air services of Australia were conducted under conditions of active competition, so that the best possible service would be available to the Australian travelling public. But such competition implies an equal right of access to available business. I also requires that each of the major operators should be in a position to operate on a basis of solvency and that each should have such security, of tenure as was necessary to enable it to  plan  its finance and future development, particularly in the ordering and operation of its fleet of new aircraft. </para>
                    <para>The problem was, and is, a complex one. After the most earnest consideration, the Government adopted a series of principles, which followed from its basic policy that the major internal services should be conducted under conditions of active competition. Briefly, those principles are as follows :  - </para>
                    <list type="decimal">
                        <item label="(1)">

                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para class="block">But, on the analysis presented to it, the Government found that those three principles of themselves would not ensure that each operator could show a profit on its operations, no matter how excellent the service that it provided. The operating costs of airlines have risen greatly. The greatest single factor in those costs is aviation spirit. Due to events in Persia and to a general rise in overseas costs, this item has increased enormously to a point where it bears very heavily upon the conduct of air transport. If there were added to these increased operating costs, air routes charges at the rates imposed in 1947, it would be impossible for either operator to show a profit. Consequently, it followed that air route charges had to be reduced. </para>
                    <para>The competition between the two operators, as honorable members know, has been intense. This intense competition has led in many cases to overlapping and to the provision of competing services which are not required by the public demand. We, therefore, thought that the two operators should get together and discuss routes, time-tables, freight, fares and other related matters, so that overlapping and wasteful competition could be eliminated. In short, we thought that there should be a rationalization of services. We recognized, of course, that the two operators, in their individual enthusiasm, might not find it easy to agree on several of these matters of routes, time-tables and fares. The principle was, therefore, adopted that a small body should be set up, under an independent chairman who would have the power to settle finally any differences that arose between the two operators in rationalizing their services. </para>
                    <para>The House will recall, as I mentioned earlier, that the Government had adopted three principles. They were - </para>

                    </list>
                    <para>To these must be added one more principle. The Government's policy is to ensure that the civil air services of Australia are conducted under conditions of active competition. It is of the very essence of that policy that each of the two major operators should be secure to plan for the conduct of air services in Australia for many years to come. So, the seventh principle was that the foregoing principles should be embodied in a long term arrangement with the operators, and that that arrangement should be approved by this Parliament. To this end, an agreement has been made with Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, and has just been signed. That agreement embodies the principles which I have mentioned, and the purpose of this bill is to give the approval of this Parliament to the agreement. </para>
                    <para>I shall outline the provisions of the agreement, which is contained in the schedule to the bill. Trans-Australia Airlines has ordered for its services in </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia six Vickers Viscount aircraft. This aircraft is considered by the technical experts to be the best type for operations on Australian trunk routes. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited also proposes to order six of these aircraft. In passing, I would like to say how pleased the Government is to see that the United Kingdom aeronautical industry is again in the forefront of the world in providing and producing civil aircraft types. Clause 3 of the agreement provides that the Commonwealth shall guarantee borrowing on overdraft by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited up to £3,000,000 for the purpose of acquiring the six Vickers Viscounts to which I have referred. </para>

There is a subsidiary obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to guarantee a further borrowing of this amount for the purchase of replacement aircraft in some period in the future, which would be at least, I should think, seven years off.

                    <para>As I have mentioned, the position of air route charges loom very large in relation to operating costs. The whole question of whether air transport services can be conducted in Australia at a profit or a loss depends entirely on the level at which air route charges are fixed. After most earnest consideration, the Government decided that the level of air route charges for the period from the 1st August, 1947, to the 30th June, 1952, should be reduced by two-thirds. I might say that, under the legislation of the Chifley Government which imposed these charges, the very gravest doubt exists whether such charges are legally payable by any operator. Honorable members will note that the agreement contains a firm obligation by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to pay the charges at the reduced rate. </para>

                            <para>- Refunds will be made to those airlines which have paid air route charges at the full rate originally contemplated, and subsidiary legislation will be introduced, later to ensure that these refunds will be liable to taxation in the same manner as if the charges had operated at the reduced rate since the 1st August, 1947. As to air route charges after the 1st July, 1952, the Government has decided that these should be at 50 per cent, of the rate originally imposed, or originally thought to be imposed in August, 1947.  As I have said, the whole question of whether air transport can be profitably conducted in Australia depends entirely on the level of these charges, and the Government has fixed this particular rate of 50 per cent, of the 1947 charges only after the deepest consideration of what the air transport industry can bear. </para>

                    <para>Any air transport operator could be crippled by a change in the rate of air route charges. The Government has, therefore, undertaken in the agreement that the rate fixed ' to operate from the 1st July, 1952, will not be increased during the term of the agreement except so far as an increase becomes necessary because of the provision of additional or improved facilities and services, or because of higher costs of maintaining and operating facilities and services. I have said that the imposition of the charges in their original form in 1947 is open to grave legal doubt. This is due to the manner in which the charges were imposed, that is, by an order of a Minister under regulations made under an act. The legal doubts arise on whether the act authorized the regulations, and whether they, in turn, authorized the Minister to impose the charges. </para>

                    <para>Clause 5 of the agreement provides for Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to have a right of access to the carriage of air mail which, I am sure it will be conceded, is only just and equitable. Honorable members will note, if they study the agreement, that the right to carry mail is contingent upon the company providing sufficient services and suitable time-tables in accordance with the requirements of the Postmaster-General. </para>
                    <para>Clause 6 is designed to give the company a right of access to government business. This has been done by providing that the holder of a government warrant shall have a free right to choose which airline he will travel by. </para>
                    <para>Clause 7 provides for what I have called "rationalization" in order to eliminate wasteful and uneconomic competition. There is no doubt that substantial savings to both operators will result from this provision. In the event of their being unable to agree over some particular matter where wasteful competition could be eliminated, the agreement provides for an independent chairman who must be a retired judge. His recommendation, while binding on the two airlines, will still be subject to confirmation by the Minister or the Director-General of Civil Aviation under the Air Navigation Regulations. </para>

Action has had to be taken only lately, during the current sessional period, to point out to visitors in the gallery that they may not smoke. Their defence has been , that honorable members are smoking within the precincts. I think that it is a custom with which we might dispense. </para>

It has been said - and I merely repeat without comment what has been said - that when Trans-Australia Airlines was provided with dollars and an import licence to- purchase its five Convairs, a request for dollars by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was refused. </para>

                            <para>- It seems to have the support of the Australian Labour party, even though the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> does not endorse it. There is no value now in trying to assess the accuracy or otherwise of those charges. The government of the clay may have had very good reasons for the refusal to which I have referred but the factual result - and this is the merit of the thing - was that, whereas TransAustralia Airlines obtained new equipment, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited did not. Clause 10 of the agreement is therefore designed to ensure that in the exercise of any Commonwealth power under, or by virtue of an act or regulations, the power will not be exercised so as to discriminate against the company. </para>

                    <para>If active competition is to be maintained, it is essential that the major operators should compete on a basis of equality and that neither one nor the other should receive advantages over its competitor. The agreement therefore provides for substantially equal treatment for the company and for the Australian National Airlines Commission in relation to the grant of import licences and the allocation of airport facilities. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, strangulation of socialistic monopolies. The agreement naturally insists that all aircraft purchased by the company or acquired by it by virtue of the provisions of the agreement shall be retained for use on Australian internal services, and the Government has also insisted that the company shall at all times maintain efficient services. In order to protect the Commonwealth's interest, the agreement provides that if the company fails to perform any of its obligations under the agreement, the Commonwealth shall have the right to terminate the agreement. </para>

                    <para>I think that I have given a sufficiently detailed account of the agreement for the purpose of acquainting the House with its provisions. I have mentioned earlier that other bills are associated with this one in order to impose air route charges and to deal with the taxation aspects of refunds of charges already paid. In addition, other subsidiary legislation will be necessary. A bill to amend the Australian National Airlines Act will insert in that act a provision requiring the commission to do those things which the agreement requires the commission to do. At the same time, minor amendments will be made which experience of the working of the commission show to be necessary. So that a strict basis of comparison will be available between the two airlines, it is also proposed that TransAustralia Airlines shall become subject to income tax in the same way as Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. This also will be dealt with in the legislation accompanying the present bill. </para>
                    <para>In commending the bill to the House, I would say that Australia is a country which, because of its vast distances, requires the very best internal air services which can be provided. The conduct of these services under conditions of active competition have produced Australian air services which are among the best in the world. The Government believes that it is its duty to ensure that those services are continued at the present high standard under conditions of active competition by the two major operators. Internal air transport is now such a fundamental factor in the organization of Australian life, that its continuance on a sound basis is elemental. It should, like the other basic industries and services in the community, be free to carry on its business undistracted by any constant worry that its future depends on the whim of the government of the day. I commend this hill to the House in the firm belief that it will assure the continuance of Australian air transport at a high standard of service and on a sound economic basis for the next fifteen years. </para>

                        <para>.- The Government claims that this bill will produce a much happier position in the maritime industry, and obviate many industrial disputes such as have occurred in it, but it has produced no real evidence that such a position will actually be achieved by the measure. It seems to me that the Government is indulging in some wishful thinking about the matter. The honorable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth),</inline> who is not with us at the moment, read from a list of disputes that had occurred during the last year or so. It is not of much use to base an argument on the number of disputes unless  «e know the full facts about them, including who is to blame and how the disputes were settled. The Maritime Industry Commission, which is .to be abolished under the measure, has existed for a long time. Its composition is interesting. The acting  chairman  is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edwards,</inline> who is associated with a big shipping company. The membership includes <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Radford</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Matthews,</inline> who represent interstate shipowners, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gibson,</inline> who represents intra-state shipowners, Captain Lawrence, who represents the Merchant Service Guild, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cole,</inline> who represents marine engineers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudehope,</inline> who represents marine cooks, bakers and butchers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moate,</inline> who represents marine stewards, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott,</inline> who represents the seamen, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bourke,</inline> who represents the Government. It seemed from the remarks of the honorable member for Mackellar that the commission was composed almost entirely of Com munists, and that it was not safe to have such a body in control of the maritime industry. It became obvious, however, by the time the honorable gentleman had finished his speech, that he could find only one Communist in the whole commission, and that was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott,</inline> the general secretary of the Seamen's Union of Australasia. </para>

                    <para>Only recently the Government facilitated a trip overseas for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott,</inline> by granting him a passport that enabled him to leave the country and visit some of his comrades abroad.. I do not object to that, but I do object in those circumstances, to the honorable member for Mackellar pointing out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott</inline> had recently gone to Budapest to receive his instructions from his Communist friends. If that is correct, the Government has failed in its obligation to the nation by having given <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott</inline> a passport that enabled him to go to Budapest to receive those instructions. The point is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott</inline> is only one of ten members of the Maritime Industry Commission. I do not believe for one moment that he alone could influence the other nine members of the commission, or even a majority of them, into making certain decisions. The argument during the debate has revolved round the Seamen's Union of Australasia as a Communist-controlled union. Honorable members opposite have had nothing to say about other maritime unions such as those which cover maritime engineers, and marine cooks, bakers, butchers, and stewards. It is obvious that there is no Communist affiliation in those unions. However, in an attempt to bolster up the Government's case, the whole of the attack from the other side of the House has been launched against the Seamen's Union of Australasia and its Communist officials. Almost all the honorable members opposite who have spoken in this debate have said that a majority of the rank and file of seamen are decent men, but that it is necessary to prevent a continuance of maritime disputes in which the seamen are involved. Just as I do not believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott</inline> alone could influence the Maritime Industry Commission's decisions, so I do not believe that he alone is responsible for all the industrial disputes in which seamen are involved. I admit frankly, however, that I know very little of the disputes in which seamen are involved, and I suppose that if all honorable members, including honorable members opposite who claim to know all about such disputes, were honest, they would admit that they also know very little about them. In fact, all they know is that disputes occur and are headlined in the press. </para>
                    <para>The bill is being rushed through the Parliament before due consideration has been given to it. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has pointed out that the members of the Maritime Industry Commission knew nothing of the bill until it was introduced in the Senate. I hope that the Government will pay heed to the plea made by the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clarey)</inline> for consultations on this matter with the trade union movement, including the Australian Council of Trades Unions, the Seamen's Union of Australasia, and the other maritime unions concerned, before proceeding further with the bill. If such a conference can be arranged and the representa- tives of both sides attend with a desire to achieve peace in the industry, the bill should be withdrawn and redrafted. It has been explained that the principal act is a complicated one, consisting of 425 clauses, which covers 241 pages of the statute-book. I do not doubt that the act should be amended, but the whole matter should be given much more consideration than it has been given. Both the shipowners and the union officials should be given a chance to make suggestions to bring about a better arrangement in the maritime industry. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Mackellar tried to smear the character of Opposition members by .accusing them of having Communist affiliations. He suggested that the honorable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson),</inline> the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. W. M. Bourke),</inline> the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clarey)</inline> and other Opposition members had been misled and that they did not understand the issue. I challenge the honorable member for Mackellar or any other honorable member opposite to show that he has done more in fighting Communist union officials than I have done. At Leigh Creek in South Australia I had the pleasure of defeating the Communist Edgar Boss at the time when members of the Australian "Workers Union were being enticed to join the miners' federation. I hope that I am not accused by the honorable member of supporting the Communists. But I am prepared to face facts and to consider what is best for the whole community, in an endeavour to determine what would be fair treatment for the seamen as well as the shipowners. "N"o one should be so one-sided as to allege that the seamen alone are responsible for the stoppages in the maritime industry. I see nothing in this bill which will contribute to the solution of the disputes which take place. Under this measure, when a dispute occurs it will be placed before the judge who is commissioned to deal with this industry. Much time will be taken up with the reference to the judge and, perhaps, with a subsequent reference to the Full Court. When the Maritime Industry Commission has dealt with these problems it has been able to make a decision immediately. If the commission discovered that it had made an incorrect decision it has been in a position immediately to rectify it. A judge is just as likely to err as are the members of the commission because judges are human as the members of the commission are human. I do not believe that judges of the Arbitration Court deliberately make wrong decisions but it is possible that a decision may not be palatable to all concerned and very often the decisions of judges have not been acceptable either to employers or employees. The advantage  of having representatives both of the employers and employees conferring to settle disputes is that they get to know each other and are prepared to give and take. Once they come before the court their counsel think it necessary to demonstrate that they are earning their money. The matter is dealt with from a purely legal angle and the case is prolonged. I support the honorable member for Bendigo in requesting the Government to confer with the Australian Council of Trades Unions and the representative of the unions which will be affected by this legislation. </para>

                        <para>.- This bill provides for the continuation for another three years of preference in employment to ex-servicemen. It also makes some other more or less routine alterations. It deals, for instance, with certain matters relating to reestablishment loans for, and the reinstatement in civil employment of, members of the Korean and Malayan forces. This measure and the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Bill with which we have already dealt are somewhat interdependent. The Opposition has no objection to the bill. The principal act was passed, of course, during the regime of the Chifley Government. As the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has pointed out, it would be unreasonable to abandon preference to ex-servicemen merely because the seven years period originally specified has now elapsed. That period ended on the 2ndSeptember of this year and this bill is made retrospective to the 3rd September so that there will be no gap in the rights of ex-servicemen. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Preference to ex-servicemen has always been a rather vexed matter. In times of full employment, however, the problem is not so acute in private industry, and the preference provisions have to be invoked only on rare occasions. Generally speaking, in such times, preference is neither sought nor insisted upon in out side industry. However, it is both sought and applied in the Commonwealth Public Service and the Public Services of the States, and for that reason it is desirable to extend the preference legislation for another three years. Returnedsoldier preference was a very live issue after the 1914-18 war, and particularly during the years of the depression, but because of the ability of the governments that preceeded this Administration to maintain full employment in Australia after "World War II., employment has been available for every one and there has been no need for ex-servicemen to insist upon their special rights. Nevertheless there is ample ground for those special rights, and the Opposition agrees that they should continue to be available to all ex-servicemen who wish to take advantage of them. If the present trend towards unemployment continues - and we all hope that it will not continue - there may be ample reason for ex-servicemen to invoke their preference rights. In regard to promotions in the public services of this country those rights are all important. If the preference rights are not continued in the Commonwealth Public Service, an anomalous position will arise in relation to State public services in which the rights are continued. The position has been fairly stated by the Prime Minister in his second-reading speech. I am pleased to learn that the work of the preference boards which did such a good job in the early post-war years has ended satisfactorily. As seven years have now elapsed since the end of the war there can be few outstanding applications for registration by civilians who rendered special service during the war. The bill provides that, after the 2nd September, no application for registration may be received. Undoubtedly the preference boards have been useful. They have endeavoured to provide some uniformity of treatment in the most difficult border-line cases. World War II. was a war of movement, not only militarily, but also in civil life. The deployment of armed forces and civil forces alike was extremely widespread. Many people performed what were actually military duties, although they were not in uniform and were not members of the services. Such cases- were, in the main,, well handled by the preference boards which consisted largely of very able citizens. Their work has now ended by the effluxion of time. Generally speaking, this bill patches up certain- provisions that are to continue, and eliminates others for which there is no further use. </para>
                    <para>There are several clauses in this measure which normally might draw considerable discussion in committee, but the proposals relating to the re-establishment and employment of men who have served in Malaya and Korea are excellent. The difficulties of their campaigns, and the- problems that will face them after they return to civilian life must be considered very carefully. Although we have only two battalions and two squadrons overseas at present, those forces are engaged in very important work. It could be described as work of a leadership character. There is not the same public interest in the rehabilitation of those servicemen as there is in the general questions of rehabilitation after a great war has been successfully concluded. This measure is designed to restore ex-servicemen to their rightful place in civilian life when they return from active service. We must ensure that the measure shall do the work for which it has been designed. The matter of technical employment is provided for by the amendments, and I suggest that a discussion of those, particularly of Part 11, could best be left until a later, stage. This is a machinery measure which will grant an extension of ex-servicemen preference for three years. The Labour party introduced the original preference bill and therefore approves of the present proposed extension. The Labour party also considers that the preference boards should be abolished and that there should be a wise and efficient recasting of the provisions relating to re-establishment, in order that the men now fighting in Korea and Malaya may be adequately dealt with. The Tradesmen's Rights Regulations Act should be read in conjunction with this bill so that there will- be an equalization of employment opportunities. </para>
                    <para>The bill meets with the approval of the Opposition, but we reserve the right to discuss several of its clauses in committee. Those clauses were not fully dealt with' by the Minister in his second-reading speech, obviously because they were technical. This matter will again be considered in three years' time. It is a useful measure but no doubt it will be abused by employers who may try to get around the law. However, it will be observed with decency and decorum by the Commonwealth and State public services, and I consider that it will serve a very useful purpose. It is necessary for any government to try to ensure full employment in the country. If that were done a preference bill of this kind would be no more than life assurance. The Opposition accepts the measure. </para>
