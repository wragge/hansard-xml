There is no doubt about that. There is no country in the world which can claim better forest management than Australia can.

Several years ago Dr Syd Shay from the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia, together with the Australian Heritage Commission, worked out a regime for what was hailed at the time by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the then minister as world leading, the pattern for the world&mdash;a green strategy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia's current account deficit for 1994-95 is expected to be a record $26 billion, the highest current account deficit in Australia's history, and climbing to well over five per cent of GDP. This current account crisis is rapidly becoming common knowledge in the community. What is less commonly known is that around $1.5 billion of that figure is directly attributable to Australia's deficit on timber products. That figure is comprised of a $2 billion import bill, partly offset by $450 million worth of exports generated by our own timber industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two stark questions quickly emerge: firstly, why is Australia with our relatively small population and rich forest areas a net importer of wood products? Secondly, why would a government supposedly committed to improving our disastrous trade position seek to obstruct the ability of our timber industry to export wood products to the rest of the world, providing jobs in Australia and helping to offset our spiralling import bill?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are important questions, important enough for 2,000 timber workers and their families to make the trip to Canberra to ask the federal government for these answers. We have timber workers here in the gallery and we have timber workers all around the parliament who want to know the answers to these very important questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been much discussion about the validity of the woodchip export licences, the questionable conduct of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, for stalling the national forest policy statement, and the ALP's clear betrayal of working-class Australians, those it purports to represent. But these issues should not be allowed to overshadow the question at the heart of this debate which is, above all, about woodchips. That is why we are here, and that is the issue that has caused so much widespread controversy in the electorate. That controversy has been fuelled by misunderstanding and misinformation, and that misinformation has been put about by a number of environmentalists following the government's decision to renew 11 woodchip export licences late last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any sane and reasonable assessment of the facts would reveal that that outcome was always the outcome that would eventuate, no matter how much Senator Faulkner raised greenie expectations. There is simply no reasonable argument to justify the end to exporting woodchips from Australia. The Greens are simply using an emotive, high profile approach to attack the timber industry and actively work towards its demise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts about woodchips are these: firstly, wood is a renewable resource; secondly, woodchips come from waste timber; and thirdly, waste timber comes from three sources, sawmill residue, silvicultural thinning and integrated logging. Sawmill residue is wood left on the sawmill floor after logs have been cut. Silvicultural thinning is an efficient and necessary forestry practice whereby quality trees are removed to allow other trees a better chance to grow into higher quality sawlogs. Integrated logging involves the removal of sawlogs and pulpwood as part of the same harvesting operation. This allows the good quality logs to be used for sawlogs and the residue to be chipped or used for some other economic use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is no different from cattle and other livestock. The main purpose of keeping cattle might be the prime cuts of meat and other by-products which can result from hide, hoofs and other parts of the animal. The Greens like to suggest that the timber industry is a bit confused as to what is residue timber and what is a good sawlog. They like to claim that the industry chips indiscriminately both the waste and prime logs. They must think that everyone is as irrational as they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The price of a good quality sawlog is approximately $400 per cubic metre, the price of woodchips is approximately $70 per cubic metre; so obviously the timber people would rather harvest sawlogs than woodchips. This is not even first-year economics. Even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) might understand those figures. He might, but he might not. But, of course, the greenies do not want to look at the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor is it sufficient for our resident caucus motion mover, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), who is over there&mdash;he sometimes comes into this House&mdash;to think that, by swanning around the trendy Fitzroy coffee shops, one becomes an expert overnight on the economic realities of rural Australia. But having failed on the matter of woodchips the Greens should admit defeat, come clean and reveal that their true agenda has nothing to do with woodchips but with the timber industry as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every crackpot environmental group in the country&mdash;or, more accurately, in the cities&mdash;is in the habit of putting on a bit of a sideshow from time to time at public rallies held in half-empty community halls. At every one of these occasions, you can bet you will see a picture of a logging coupe after being clear-felled, along with an emotive caption about Australian heritage being chipped and shipped to Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first point is that only 30 per cent of our publicly owned forests are available for logging. I repeat: only 30 per cent of our publicly owned forest lands are available for logging in the first place. My second point is that, in many areas in Australia's south-east, clear-felling is the most environmentally sound harvesting practice. In wet, high quality forest areas, new trees need plenty of sunlight and bare earth, just as one gets after a bushfire. It would be foolhardy and irresponsible to try to plant new trees amongst others because they would be overtaken by other species which can thrive in these dark conditions. In those areas, clear-felling is the only sound practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not seem to hear much protesting from greenies when farmers clear-fell their wheat crop or when suburban dads clear-fell the back lawn and use the grass clippings for compost. Yet the principle of clear-felling regrowth forest is the same&mdash;renewable resources are being sustainably managed for maximum gain. Once the area has been clear-felled in accordance with sound forestry practice, what would our green friends do with the residue timber which cannot be used for sawlogs? Should we burn it, creating yet more greenhouse gases, or should we leave the waste behind so the greenies can contrive an indignant rage at the mess left behind by the loggers? The best policy is to find some way of using the residue for economic gain, and woodchips offer that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the woodchips are processed in Australia. Several workers here from Australian Paper Mills' Maryvale mill are represented in this chamber by the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham), who, I think, has threatened to resign from the government because he is so upset about the whole project. Other woodchips are sold overseas. Many go to Japan to make fine computer paper. I am sure that we have all heard the green propaganda line that bits of Australian heritage are going off to Japan. This line tries to stereotype developed Asian economies as cold, ruthless, environmental rapists. The issue of where woodchips go should not matter to the radical Greens. They do not even care whether a tree gets chipped or becomes a sawlog. For them, as long as the tree is cut down, we have an environmental catastrophe on our hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The woodchip issue is a complete red herring. But the Greens find it relevant because it is the only area over which the Commonwealth has any powers. Land management is controlled by the states but, of course, the Commonwealth controls the woodchip export licences and can get into this argument. It is only by placing conditions on the woodchip export licences that the federal government can buy into the argument and placate the green movement. However, that does not affect the question of whether logging can go ahead in these areas. The government's pretence that it can actually protect areas&mdash;as the Prime Minister claims from time to time&mdash;is just vain posturing. Only state governments can close off areas to logging, as they have done to good effect in Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales under world-class logging practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventy per cent of Australia's publicly owned native forests are in some sort of reserve system. Nevertheless, the annual licence renewal circus is dominated by the radical Greens pleading with the government to effectively outlaw the export of woodchips which come from areas they deem worthy of protection. However, these restrictions usually do not affect the woodchip exporters, who make up their tonnage elsewhere. At the end of the market, it really affects the sawmillers and the contractors, who have to sell their residue timber from the 511 coupes that the Prime Minister has designated as totally sacred and not to be interfered with. So it is that end sale of residue material that makes the whole harvest operation viable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all the monotonous moanings of the green movement about the multinational corporations, the sawmilling industry&mdash;the industry most affected by the decisions of the present government and Prime Minister&mdash;is dominated by Australian family businessmen. We have members here in the gallery, not overseas multinational corporations. The industry is labour intensive and is providing many rural jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth cannot protect the logging coupe, regardless of the vain pleadings of the Prime Minister. All the federal government can do is inflict economic hardship on local sawmillers by removing their ability to export and sell their residue material to make woodchips. That is not protection of the forests; it is economic vandalism and is plundering an industry that is viable. The recent decisions of the government make it very difficult for all those Australian families represented here in the gallery. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not Sydney airport. I want to discuss the World Summit for Social Development. The world summit is on three core themes which are of concern to everyone in every country: the reduction of poverty, the reduction of unemployment and the strengthening of social integration. In Australia, the central economic and social issue with which we have to be concerned is the growth of employment. The world summit is on one of the central themes that dominate our political life and our economic and social concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Third Preparatory Committee for the World Summit for Social Development has just finished its meeting in New York. I was privileged to be part of the Australian delegation at that conference. The conference ran for two weeks. We negotiated a declaration and a program of action which heads of government and heads of state will discuss at the summit in Copenhagen on 11 March and 12 March. There has been very little publicity about this summit, which is a pity, but it is understandable because so far it has been only in the planning stage. There will be a great deal of publicity about it during the first two weeks of March as it is prepared and then actually held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central theme of the summit concerns the interrelationship of economic and social questions. A particularly good example of that interrelationship occurred over the holiday period&mdash;that is, the effects on Mexico of the collapse of the peso. Honourable members will be aware that the peso collapsed by about 45 per cent over a two-week period around Christmas and the New Year. That has had a shattering impact on the Mexican economy. In order to cope with that decline in its exchange rate, the Mexican government has increased interest rates so that mortgage rates are now around 48 per cent and credit card interest rates are around 75 per cent. There is talk of a major reduction in wages. So real incomes of both wage earners and the middle class are going to be massively reduced in order to cope with this collapse in the exchange rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation demonstrates vividly the interrelationship of a very narrow part of the economy&mdash;in that case, the financial markets&mdash;with the whole of society. It is becoming clear to lots of people that a relatively narrow approach to economic policy during the last couple of decades in lots of countries and in the major international financial institutions has caused a growth of social problems. It is quite clear, for example, that the number of people living in absolute poverty, principally in the developing world but also to some extent in the richer industrialised world, has increased over those two decades. The proportions in some countries have fallen, but the absolute number of people living in extreme poverty has increased. This suggests that the economic policies being used were not effective in achieving improvements in the wellbeing of everyone in those societies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that in Australia we have a serious problem of unemployment and therefore poverty. Therefore, the themes being addressed by the summit are of great importance to us. One of the points of recognition which has led to the holding of the summit is that many of these serious social and economic problems cannot be addressed by countries alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia, for example, wants to move steadily towards full employment, as is the government's goal, we will have to adopt the kinds of polices that are now being put in place and we will be assisted if other countries do the same. It is very difficult for one country alone to achieve full employment unless the same kinds of policies are adopted in many other countries at the same time. So the central themes of the summit are of great importance to us as well as to other countries where social problems are even more severe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The summit preparations are now well advanced. The third prepcom, which has just finished, was attended by around 150 countries. It lasted for two weeks. Quite commonly we negotiated from about 8 o'clock in the morning till midnight. Agreement has been reached on most of the issues. The summit leaders will be asked to address and to sign a declaration and a program of action. The declaration includes 10 commitments. Many of those commitments are of great importance. For example, the first relates to a commitment to steadily reduce extreme poverty. One of Australia's suggestions to the prepcom was that countries should commit themselves to preparing, by the end of next year, national strategies for poverty reduction. Many countries already have such strategies and in those countries the summit is urging that those strategies be strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, the Australian delegation, got acceptance for the idea that the very ambitious target of the end of next year should be set for the preparation of comprehensive national strategies for poverty reduction. Another of the proposals that we advocated, and which many other countries advocated as well, was reiteration of the UN charter commitment to full employment. There was debate at the first and second preparatory committees about whether it was realistic to reiterate a goal of full employment but Australia, because it is our government's policy, advocated that the goal of full employment should be given a central place in the declaration from the summit. That has been agreed and is something of which we can all be proud. It continues the Australian tradition of involvement in that issue. Members will perhaps remember that Australia made a big issue of full employment in 1945 when the charter was being prepared and when Dr Evatt was our foreign minister. We were instrumental in ensuring a very fine wording of that part of the charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia and a number of other countries also joined forces in strengthening the commitment within the declaration and the program of action to improve employment opportunities, income, wellbeing and services for indigenous peoples. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is at the table, has a strong commitment to and a very strong record of achievement in this area. He will be glad to know that Australia, together with Canada and New Zealand, advocated quite strong commitments to improvements in the wellbeing of indigenous peoples. That was accepted by the conference and it is likely to be agreed at the Copenhagen summit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also debate about how to express a commitment to equity and equality for women. Australia was very active in that debate as well. We were also active in the debate relating to disabled people. In other words, all the groups that one can imagine&mdash;and there are others, of course, such as recent migrants&mdash;which have a tendency to be less well served, to be marginalised and to have fewer income earning opportunities were discussed, their concerns addressed and programs of action suggested for countries to take up so as to rapidly improve their conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, such programs require revenue and there was also discussion at the summit about how to ensure an adequate revenue base for the services that marginalised groups and the whole community require. After some debate, there was a commitment by all countries to an efficient and progressive national tax system. There was a debate about what the word `progressive' really means. It means that those with the capacity to pay, pay a larger proportion of their income than those on low incomes. So there was a clear commitment to equity within the summit discussions, and it is impressive that that was true of the United States, Japan and Europe, as well as Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other issues are to be addressed at the summit. It is going to be a very important meeting. I hope there will be more discussion in this House of this event as it draws closer and that members are able to see the debates that occur. This will be a very significant step towards improved economic and social programs in the post-Cold War world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I grieve for this parliament. As a consequence, I grieve for the people of Australia. I want to say a few words today about the depth to which parliamentary conduct in Australia has sunk under the Keating government. Time is very brief in this debate and, whilst there are many things I could say and many issues I could raise, I will have to confine myself on the number of issues on which I speak. Time permitting, I shall speak in particular about question time, ministerial statements and the handling of legislation in this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday morning we opened the day with a debate about the conduct of parliament. The Special Minister of State, the member for Petrie (Mr Johns), fell into the cracked record mode that government members fall into on this subject. He said that there had been a report by the Procedure Committee, of which I am deputy chairman&mdash;which he pointed out in his speech&mdash;in which certain reforms were recommended. I shall now put on record and restate for the benefit of members just what it was that the Procedure Committee recommended in relation to question time. I point out that the Procedure Committee is made up of both government and opposition members. The government holds the position of chairman and has a very clear majority on the committee. The committee's recommendation in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time: bills, questions and working hours</EMPHASIS> in relation to question time was the unanimous recommendation of all members of that committee, including Labor Party members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to sitting patterns and sitting times, we recommended that parliament should sit one extra day per fortnight, that is, the first Monday of a sitting fortnight. We included a trade-off for the government in that by saying that we would recommend a limited roster system for question time. For some time, the government had been wanting to introduce a roster system, and it was no secret that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in particular wanted to introduce a roster system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's recommendation was a limited roster only on Mondays of sitting weeks and that the opposition would have a right of veto over that roster, except in the case of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was not to be on Monday's roster&mdash;he was to be excused from parliament that day&mdash;but there would be a roster of other ministers, including junior ministers, on Mondays only. It was to be the right of the opposition to say that if a minister not on that roster was required by the opposition to be present for question time on that Monday, then it had the right to veto that minister's absence. That was the committee's recommendation. What did we get instead?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister took to cabinet a recommendation on a roster in which he would have appeared in parliament only on one day a week; he would not have been excused on one day a week, he would appear on only one day a week. Even his own caucus revolted at that recommendation; it insisted on two days a week. His response to that was to roster himself to appear in question time on Mondays also. Of course, we do not sit every Monday of a sitting week, for example, the first week of the commencement of a sitting pattern. We do not sit on at least three Mondays of the year. In those weeks the Prime Minister comes in only once a week. So they split the difference on that one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one such week&mdash;a week of great moment to the Australian people. Parliament House is blockaded, a major industry is under threat, many Australians have deep concerns about the direction of environmental policy and the future of this nation, and the Prime Minister has not yet this week set foot in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the Treasurer (Mr Willis) announcing tax increases in Tuesday's question time&mdash;policy, if ever there were policy. It should never be announced at question time. When we have issues like that, because of the roster we do not have the right to call the Treasurer the next day to ask him more questions so that we can find out more about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let there be no misunderstanding. The Procedure Committee is in no way responsible for the depth to which question time is falling at present. In addition to that recommendation of a limited roster, the committee recommended supplementary questions. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has never addressed the issue of the committee's recommendation for supplementary questions in this chamber. He will refer to the Procedure Committee report when he chooses, but he has never uttered a word on the subject of the committee's recommendation for supplementary questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House likes to refer to the House of Commons as some sort of justification for rosters. I place on the record that in 1992&mdash;the last year for which I have figures&mdash;whilst this chamber sat for 60 days the House of Commons sat for 143 days, between two and three times more. The Canadian House of Commons sat for 111 days&mdash;twice as many. Even dear little old New Zealand sat for 98 days and put us in disgrace. We are sitting a few more days now, but we are getting less access to certain ministers at question time. By that, I believe the government stands condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken before on the subject of ministerial statements. I have here a table of the number of ministerial statements from 1970 to 1993. The table shows the decline in the percentage of its time that the House spends on ministerial statements from 2.1 per cent in 1970 to 0.4 in 1993. The figures for last year would probably be even lower. They</PARA>
<PARA>have been higher than 1970 on occasion. But, effectively, ministerial statements have gone from this chamber, which is one of the reasons we get policy statements and pronouncements in question time. On a previous occasion, the Leader of the House said that the reason for the government not giving ministerial statements was that ministerial statements made in here also had to go to the Senate and&mdash;goodness me!&mdash;the Senate insists on debating them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives has a second chamber which is supposed to extend members' debating opportunities. I welcome the fact that the government picked up the recommendation that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and I made in debate on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time: bills, questions and working hours</EMPHASIS> report to include reports as well as legislation in the Main Committee's business. But we also need to debate ministerial statements in there. </PARA>

Australia is one of the fastest growing western economies on this planet. That is something that the opposition does not seem to comprehend. The inflation rate is projected to rise from 2.25 to 3.25. That is an economic performance that rivals any western economy on the face of the earth, and it contrasts sharply with inflation rates that existed at the time this government came to power in 1983.

The opposition does not mention that Australia's competitiveness has improved some 40 per cent since this government came to power. We took on the hard tasks of restructuring industries. The electorate that I represent lost a small provincial city in employment terms because of your neglect, when the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer, to get down to the task of looking down the tunnel and restructuring Australian industry to take its place with the best of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not have to tell me anything about restructuring industry which you neglected when you were in power. Do you know what? I went to demonstrations and rallies by dairy farmers at that time, and restructuring was a hard pill for a lot of dairy farmers to swallow. But look at the dairy industry now: it has been restructured, is export orientated and has best practice on the farms and in the factories and is slaying the world's international markets. It is not the policies of this government that will really impede the growth of that industry but policies of governments like the United States that preach free trade and do nothing about it&mdash;like an opposition that preached about restructuring the Australian economy and did nothing about it. </PARA>

HiFert has invested $2.3 million installing robotics equipment and its total local investment now is $10 million.

Hoechst has invested $10 million in a new plant in Lara, creating 100 construction jobs. The finishing date is June 1995.

Let me tell them something about their leader. In the whole time that he held the Treasury portfolio, the honourable member for Bennelong could not bring the federal budget into surplus. And those opposite get up in this place and lecture the government about putting the budget into surplus! They seem to forget that after their deficits, we put it into surplus in the mid-1980s. We went into deficit to stimulate economic activity in regions such as mine, and we have a program to bring the budget back into surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the external account. The honourable member for Higgins is out there bleating about this being the worst current account deficit on record. Do you know anything about economics? The only real measure of a current account deficit is to measure it against the value of the production of the economy of this nation. When the current Leader of the Opposition had the Treasury portfolio in 1982, the current account deficit was 5.5 per cent of GDP. What is it now? It is 5.6 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was originally prompted to participate in this grievance debate by a letter that arrived on my desk yesterday and by the comments of the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) in this place yesterday. But now I am prompted by a third force&mdash;the remarks just made by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). Does the member for Corio seriously imagine that if his party were in opposition and we were in government, and we were to hand down a current account deficit at record levels and the overseas borrowings of this nation under our stewardship were to go from $30 billion to $160 billion, he would sit on this side of the House and be silent? Of course he does not. He would be the first to be critical of what he would see as very poor stewardship&mdash;poor stewardship because, clearly, we had been importing more than we were exporting and had gone on doing that for the whole period in government and blown out our overseas borrowings. The member for Corio simply cannot be critical of the opposition for focusing the nation's attention on what is in fact a disastrous trading figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not rise to be critical of the government. I rose because I happen to be very concerned about the way we go about trading reform. I am also irritated because the member for Corio has the barefaced effrontery to accuse me and, by implication, my party of being a part of what he sees as the present economic difficulties. The reality is that the very structural reform that the member for Corio has claimed credit for&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;has occurred as a result of changes in this parliament that have been endorsed by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the member for Corio or, for that matter, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) think it is like sitting here in opposition while there are proposals to reform the dairy industry, proposals to lower the tariff walls in the citrus industry, with which I am as familiar as the member for Corio is with the dairy industry, and proposals to allow tariffs to fall in the car industry? While the government made all these proposals, we were here in opposition agreeing with it. Any record will show that the opposition agreed with the government when it would have been a lot easier for us&mdash;as the member for Wills is currently doing and the Australian Democrats did&mdash;to disagree with the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was I doing when I had to face citrus growers in my electorate who were being swamped by imported Brazilian juice? As recently as December last year, I was defending the actions of the government under GATT. Did I get any thanks from the government? Of course not, because that would be much too easy, wouldn't it? That would be conceding that the parliament works. That would be agreeing that sometimes the opposition takes tough decisions that are unpopular ones. The reality is that the opposition has actually been prepared to agree that the sorts of reforms the member for Corio outlined were necessary but has received no credit for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It still hurts like hell in the community that the tariff walls have come down. The remarks made by the honourable member for Wills yesterday prompted me to frame these words today. Not surprisingly and not unreasonably, the honourable member for Wills would have the rest of us in the parliament believe that what we should do is protect Australian industries. We know that that is popular. Members opposite know that that is popular. The simple fact is that the opposition has resisted that popular call. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could create work in Australia, and so could members opposite. I could create work in agriculture by simply forbidding anyone from using a tractor that generated more than 75 horsepower so that there would be more tractors and more people driving them, and thus the cost of our production would go up. The honourable member for Corio knows that he could generate all sorts of work by making it harder for his tanneries, obliging them to employ more people. The cost of all tanned goods would go up. The sort of expansion that the honourable member for Corio has illustrated is occurring in his electorate would not be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To its credit, the opposition has avoided being populous and has supported the honourable member for Corio and the government in these tough reforms. We are critical that these reforms have simply not gone far enough. The government has frustrated our calls for reform in order to make this a more productive country. A classic illustration of that is the industrial relations area. I said that I came in here because I received a letter yesterday from a constituent of mine who is the chairperson of the Angaston Branch of the Australian Dried Fruits Association.

The position now is quite clear. If the status quo is maintained regarding tariffs and current policy there will be no industry left in a couple of years. Here is the very disturbing picture. In 1982-83 season imports were less than 200 tonne and now (1994-1995) the anticipated figure will top 4,000 tonne with last year's figure 2,989 tonne. While an increase in the tariff similar to other competing nations would be a great help it will not solve the problem altogether. Our cost of production is far too high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This letter then is firstly to inform you of the desperate position of the industry and ask you if anything can be done in assistance and what adjustment schemes etc are available.

<PARA>Here is Mr Plush with a labour intensive industry facing real competition from Turkish imports. What is my comment to Mr Plush? My comment to Mr Plush is this: right now Australia is awash with opportunity if we produce quality product. The dried fruit industry is a labour intensive industry. It is an industry which I know well and in which I once participated. What Mr Plush needs is the opportunity for real industrial relations reform, not so that his cost of production mirrors that of the Turks&mdash;no-one is proposing that Australians should be asked to work for less&mdash;but to mirror the experience of the New Zealanders who have found themselves competitive across the globe because of their industrial relations reforms. Furthermore, the changes that the government has proposed&mdash;and which the opposition has supported&mdash;give us all sorts of new opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rang Austrade to discover whether it was aware of expanding export industries and I was given examples of some industries that are agriculturally based. I was told, for example, that the hay industry in my own electorate will increase from 50,000 tonnes a year exported to 200,000 tonnes a year targeted export&mdash;thanks to the coordination of hay producers into Japan through Austrade; thanks to some smart marketing; thanks to ensuring that the quality of our hay is better than that of American hay; and recognising that our competition is not the neighbour across the fence but the Americans across the water. Austrade mentioned that the racehorse industry has a similar sort of expansion program. This will interest the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). Yearling sales are expected to increase from $30 million to $100 million thanks to some of the reforms that I concede the government has introduced and the opposition has supported, although the support of the opposition has been rarely recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same thing applies to the seed industry. And for the interest of those who are currently encircling Parliament House, the same thing applies in the timber industry. I am not pretending to be an authority on the woodchip industry, which is not represented in my electorate anyway, but while Austrade's particular focus was not woodchips, it is true to say that in the area of quality timber&mdash;I am not in any sense suggesting that there is no opportunity in the woodchip industry&mdash;Austrade sees a major movement in the opportunity for exports as we take quality timber and encourage the Japanese to see what can be done, not only in flooring but in furniture and cabinets, with quality timber exports from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same thing applies with fishing. We could go on and on. The same thing applies in my own industry, the citrus industry, where right now more money is being generated exporting navel oranges into America&mdash;if you please&mdash;than is being generated in any other market. Why? Because, while GATT hurts, GATT gives us the opportunity to eyeball Americans across the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not pretend it is easy. I do not pretend that they play fair. But if I do not have a table over which to eyeball them, I cannot front them with the sorts of trading difficulties they provide for me. That is what GATT has done. That is what the government's involvement in GATT has allowed us to do. And it has happened with the support of the opposition, although it was politically unpopular. This would be a more honourable place if that were recognised by members such as the member for Corio. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to rise on the grievance debate today but before I go on to the subject that most concerns me about the state of New South Wales I would like to make a few comments on what the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has offered in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe in what he is saying: sure the opposition, through our democratic system, will agree with us some of the time but it obviously disagrees with us nearly all of the time. For a recent example of that we only have to look at the level of debate that occurred yesterday on both sides of this House on the Anzac Day Bill. And yet one of the member's colleagues, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), got up in this House and played to the timber and woodchipping industry in the gallery during that debate. Personally, I found that to be appalling. That is why I put on record here my feelings, because the member for Wakefield has given me the opportunity to do so. I do say that democracy says that we must agree some of the time but, obviously, in opposition you do disagree with us most of the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I want to grieve on today relates to my state of New South Wales where, in 51 days, the people of our state will have the chance to pass judgment on what was the Greiner and is now the Fahey Liberal government, which has administered that state now for some seven years. In my grievance I wish to raise three issues on which the Fahey government, in its relations with our Commonwealth government, has shown nothing but contempt for the people of New South Wales&mdash;three examples of the type of arrogance in the New South Wales government which I know will lead the people of New South Wales to elect a Carr Labor government on 25 March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A federalist system like Australia's depends on cooperation between the states and the federal government over a wide range of issues. While the Liberal Party ferociously defends the symbolic shibboleths of the constitution, the Liberal government in New South Wales, with the support of the National Party which has joined with it in coalition, has abandoned completely the cooperation essential to federalism and has shamefully abrogated its responsibilities under a whole range of agreements and protocols ranging from child care to assistance for homeless youths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The longest running dispute between our Commonwealth and the state of New South Wales is about the provision of child-care places. Of course, child care is an issue of great importance throughout all of Australia, but particularly within my electorate of Prospect. In my area we have a relatively young age structure compared with many other electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the 1991 census, out of 50 seats in New South Wales, only 11 have more residents aged under five than my electorate of Prospect, and 24.9 per cent of the residents of Fairfield City are aged between zero and 14 years compared to the state average of 21.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I was outraged when I learnt that two years after an offer from the Commonwealth government the Fahey Liberal government has still failed to sign the national child-care strategy. Under the 1992-96 national child-care strategy the Commonwealth made available to New South Wales almost 2,000 new community based long care child-care places. This allocation, along with the funding for outside school hour places, was subject to a cost sharing agreement with the New South Wales government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, more than two years after this offer to create those 2,000 new child-care places in New South Wales, the Fahey Liberal government has still refused to sign the national child-care strategy. Every time the negotiating parties are close to an agreement, the New South Wales government comes up with another excuse for not signing. Not only that; the Fahey government, as of November last year, had failed to meet its obligations under the 1988 national child-care strategy. Four years after the strategy reached its conclusions, the New South Wales government had still not fulfilled its obligations. The people of New South Wales deserve better than to be the pawns in the state government's political games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully, our federal government has bypassed that state government to provide some Commonwealth funded places in partnership with community groups and local governments. Our federal government is providing some 460 such places in New South Wales, so as of this day the New South Wales government in reality has deprived its constituents of up to 1,500 child-care places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area where that state government has been grossly incompetent is the implementation of the youth protocol which clarifies the responsibilities of the two levels of government with respect to our youth in New South Wales under 15 years of age. The New South Wales government agreed to the protocol coming into effect in October of 1994. Compared with the national child-care strategy, which the New South Wales government did not even bother to sign, we should be grateful for small mercies. However, I am not exaggerating, because facts will bear it out, when I say that the government's implementation of this agreement has been nothing short of disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background, I  point out that the protocol states that the Department of Social Security will refer the young person in the first instance to emergency food and accommodation services. The state Department of Community Services will, after a period of no longer than five days, assume responsibility for the young person, meeting all the income, accommodation and other support needs. The Department of Social Security retains the discretion to pay special benefit to any young person in exceptional circumstances at any time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, under an agreement between Minister Longley and the Public Service Association, the Department of Community Services within the New South Wales government responds to cases referred under the protocol only&mdash;and I quote its words, not mine&mdash;`when all other work demands have been met'. I am simply astounded that a government could treat a group in our society as vulnerable as our homeless youths under 15 in such a cavalier fashion. To target such a group as optional extras in government policy is a damning indictment of the heartless nature of that government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The protocol has been working well in every state except New South Wales and Western Australia. I understand it has even been working relatively well under the Kennett government in Victoria. It is a sad day indeed for the people of New South Wales when John Fahey as their Premier out-Kennetts Kennett. What I mean by that is that I did not think there was much worse a Premier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue I raise is the failure of the Fahey government to match the Commonwealth's funding to improve the training and support of workers under the supported accommodation assistance program. SAAP, as it is commonly known, has always been a program which depends on cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states. SAAP provides safe and secure shelter, counselling and crisis resolution, referral and advocacy services, outreach support to the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless, and living skills programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give an example of the types of outcomes achieved under this program. The Cornerstone youth accommodation program in my electorate at Fairfield accommodates residents between the ages of 15 and 18 for a period of six to 12 months. Each resident at Cornerstone has an individual contract which states that that person must agree to partake in the centre's activities&mdash;such as education skills and house meetings&mdash;and to contribute to the program through doing chores, such as shopping, when required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members in this House would appreciate the enormous stress placed upon workers in this scheme, who are usually employed by charitable institutions and who frequently suffer burnout. That is why in the last Commonwealth budget $19 million was allocated to improve training and support services for workers in the supported accommodation assistance program. Of that, $3 million was allocated to the state of New South Wales for this specific purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when we investigate further as to what has happened to that $3 million, we find that the state government again has failed to meet its obligation and match this funding. When John Fahey, as Premier of that state until March 25 only, waltzes around New South Wales pretending to be the nice guy of New South Wales politics, it will be very clear to the voters on March 25 that he has been anything but nice to the working families and to the homeless in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I grieve particularly today because I am concerned at the lack of child-care facilities in an electorate such as mine. I think it is important that it is being brought to the notice of this House because it concerns all caring people in this country. It is of the utmost concern to the voters of New South Wales so they can make sure they vote correctly when they go to the polls on 25 March. They are the people who need to know about what has not taken place when money has been allocated at a Commonwealth level and when protocols have been agreed to by the state governments, particularly by the New South Wales government, and about how remiss it has been in not fulfilling its obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about cooperation, as the opposition has often done in this House, as did the honourable member for Wakefield in his speech earlier, we also talk about coming to an agreement that has money behind it, that has people benefiting from it but, most particularly, that requires implementation through cooperation, and that cooperation has been sadly lacking in New South Wales. It is about time the people of New South Wales are made aware of it. I sincerely hope that they will become aware of what they are in for if that government is to be returned. As I said, I am confident a Carr Labor government will come into New South Wales. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer to two matters this morning. The first matter concerns some remarks made by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) in a debate in this chamber last year, and then I propose to turn to comments made by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in this House on Tuesday on employment growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wills, in a speech on the Racial Hatred Bill on 16 November last year, referred to Dr Colin Rubenstein, who is well-known to me, as `an anti-Arab Gulf War protagonist' and also referred to `the racial and religious vilification inherent in the media's gluttonous approach to the Gulf War, including statements such as those by Rubenstein'. These references to Dr Rubenstein as being `anti-Arab' and perpetrating `racial and religious vilification' are totally unwarranted, unsubstantiated, untrue and defamatory accusations which should be completely repudiated by the honourable member for Wills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wills is unable to differentiate between criticism of Saddam Hussein's terrorism and his actions, including his annexation of Kuwait, his cruel repression of Iraqi Shi'ites and Kurds, his subsequent scorched earth policy in Kuwait on the one hand, for example, from hostility to Arabs in general on the other. The latter has never characterised any of Dr Rubenstein's positions or attitudes in any shape or form whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statements quoted by the honourable member for Wills as the sole basis for his allegation in fact show that he has accused Dr Rubenstein without any substantial basis whatsoever. The statement on which the honourable member for Wills relied occurred in the lead-in to an article in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS> on 31 August 1990 on Saddam Hussein's long record of using state sponsored terrorism after his annexation of Kuwait and while Australians were being held hostage in Baghdad. The lead-in to the article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia may be the target of a large force of terrorists assembled by Saddam Hussein.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an innocuous statement, but one of course written by the leader writer and not by Dr Rubenstein. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wills, we remember, opposed the Gulf War, unlike 80 per cent of Australians, most of the Arab world and the international community. If being anti-Saddam Hussein makes one anti-Arab, the Kuwaitis, Saudi Arabians, Egyptians, Syrians and most of the Arab world, and indeed the international community in terms of its hostility to Saddam Hussein, can also be regarded as anti-Arab. The absurdity of this position is self-evident to everyone except, apparently, the honourable member for Wills and any individuals who may have pressed this malicious allegation upon him. If he has a shred of integrity, I ask the honourable member for Wills to withdraw his obnoxious and cowardly statement about Dr Rubenstein unreservedly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the remaining time I want to comment on the employment trends about which the Treasurer spoke in question time on Tuesday. The Treasurer told the House that the government was revising its projection for employment growth from 3 per cent up to 3 3/4per cent and for unemployment downwards from 9 1/2 per cent to 8 1/2 per cent. The Treasurer claimed that 300,000 additional jobs had been created in the course of the year 1994-95 and that 477,000 jobs had been created since the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government would like everyone to believe that these trends are evidence of the success of its economic policies. The coalition believes that there is nothing more important for the wellbeing of Australians than getting rid of the shortage of paid employment which has plagued Australia for over a decade&mdash;indeed, which goes back to the Whitlam era. The creation of new jobs is something that we support and regard as being of fundamental importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The demand for more paid work than is currently available in the community is enormous. If we consider unemployment as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics alone, the number of unemployed people on the government's own statistics is still higher than at the peak of the recession of the early 1980s. If we add to those formally recorded as being unemployed the more than half a million people who are under-employed, the over 700,000 people who would like to get work but are currently in training, education or other activities, and the almost 150,000 discouraged job seekers, we find that there are some two million people in this community who cannot get the work they want under the government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to look specifically at the figures referred to by the Treasurer, because they simply do not carry with them the message that the government would like the Australian people to accept. A very large proportion of the jobs about which the government speaks are part-time jobs. In fact, in the year to December last&mdash;the latest figures&mdash;over half of all new jobs were part-time. This is despite the fact that the demand in the community is overwhelmingly for full-time work. </PARA>

Many employers will do anything but take on a full-time employee because of the rigidities with which the government is now surrounding full-time employment.

That is an increase of 47,000 over the previous year in this one program alone. There is no doubt that a great many of these people will respond to the ABS survey with the information that they are in employment, although the reality is that many of them&mdash;as the participants know only too well&mdash;will be back on the unemployment queues again at the end of their period of subsidised employment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among other things which attract me to their work is the fact that they have adopted the term `economic fundamentalism' to replace the misnomer `economic rationalism' to describe our more recent dry economics which spawned the nonsense of monetarism&mdash;so eloquently expressed by its chief sorcerer Milton Friedman&mdash;and applied under such banners as Reaganomics, Thatcherism and Rogernomics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also experimented with it in our domestic policy making. Economic fundamentalism is a much more appropriate label, especially because of its interesting suggestion of religious fundamentalism and other flat earth sciences. In an objective and academic way, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Work for all</EMPHASIS> represents an effective response to much of the free market supply side trickle down nonsense of the last 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one needs to accept every claim, or premise, or conclusion of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Work for all</EMPHASIS> to be impressed with its coherent and disciplined analysis of much of the recent economic voodooism. It explores, exposes and explodes many of the economic myths which have, explicitly or implicitly, been core elements of the policy makers. These extend from such crude obscenities as the premise that the unemployed are themselves responsible for their own economic circumstances to other more sophisticated but no less objectionable economic premises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Langmore and Quiggan present a creative approach to the development of economic policy within a framework of social responsibility. They illustrate that social responsibility and sensible economic policies are not mutually exclusive. They have provided many good examples of the intelligent application of lateral thinking in devising innovative solutions and new policy options to deal with some of the more  persistent contemporary economic problems. It is a scholarly and socially responsible effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its publication is also timely because, at last, the momentum is building up towards the abandonment of some of the more nonsensical manifestations of dry free market economics, especially our experimental adventures with level playing fields, small governments, deregulation, crowding out, the twin deficit theory, monetary growth targets of the 1970s and early 1980s, the public sector borrowing requirement, the alleged relationship between profit rates and private sector investment, the alleged direct relationship between the federal deficit and interest rates, the claim that supply creates its own demand, and the voodoo belief that the interests of the poor and disadvantaged are best pursued by increasing the incomes and privileges of the wealthy because the benefits will trickle down to those underneath. The best analogy for the trickle down theory is that it is best illustrated when the rich and powerful urinate on the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Langmore and Quiggan would be perfectly justified in being angry. However, that is not apparent in their book. They have calmly and dispassionately developed their case. They have illustrated in a succinct way that the development of appropriate and effective policy responses need not be at the expense of those qualities which should be central to any policy framework&mdash;human welfare, equity, security and opportunity. They should not simply be some kind of incidental side effect but primary and essential policy objectives. </PARA>

<PARA>This bill proposes to amend the National Health Act 1953, the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will give effect to the government's package of reforms to private health insurance. These reforms focus on consumer rights and provide:</PARA>
<PARA>.Value for money in private health insurance;</PARA>
<PARA>.A wider choice of products achieved by enabling health funds to make contracts with hospitals and doctors; and</PARA>
<PARA>.The reforms also provide for efficiency measures and equitable access. </PARA>
<PARA>Medicare is the centrepiece of the government's health policy and enjoys strong community support. The latest market survey shows that over 87 per cent of the population support the Medicare program. Medicare provides an accessible, high quality public health system for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private health insurance offers a choice for those who want it, but it needs to be seen for what it is&mdash;a supplement to the public health system. However, those persons who choose this product are entitled to high quality and good value in the same way as buyers of any other product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say consumers are not getting that now and that is why participation rates for private health insurance are continuing to decline, with consumers suffering ever-increasing premiums and high and unanticipated costs when they use the private system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms will place the health insurance industry in a position to achieve efficiency gains and pass on the benefit of those gains to their members in the form of lower premiums and better controlled costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now outline the main elements of the reform package. Health funds have traditionally been seen simply as `bill payers'. These reforms will encourage them to be purchasers of health services and representatives of their members. Under the arrangements proposed by this bill, from 1 April 1995, funds may enter into hospital purchaser-provider agreements with hospitals. The primary aims of requiring contracts between funds and hospitals are:</PARA>
<PARA>-to generate competition between health funds and hospitals, resulting in improved efficiency leading to better value for money, quality and access for patients;</PARA>
<PARA>-to link hospital funding to appropriate quality assurance and accreditation procedures; and</PARA>
<PARA>-to reduce restrictions on products offered, thereby allowing funds to operate according to market demand for different products. </PARA>
<PARA>The bill also attaches conditions to any such contract with hospitals requiring them to submit a single account covering all service and facility components and provide data for modelling, evaluation and research purposes. In the first instance, contracts between funds and hospitals can be on the current basis of per diem payments, including the structure of basic and supplementary tables or on a casemix payment basis. The current basic table of insurance will continue to be available up to 1 July 1997 to hospitals which enter into a contract. On 1 July 1997, the basic and supplementary tables will cease and contracts will be structured on the basis of a casemix payment system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a national commitment to replace the current private health insurance per diem payment system with casemix payments. Casemix is the most significant Commonwealth health financing initiative developed in Australia. It sometimes sounds arcane and technical&mdash;but basically it is a simple idea which enables the measurement of what happens in hospitals; that is, the episodes of care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term `casemix' means the types or mix of patients which a hospital treats, but can refer to any scientific approach to the classification of patient care episodes and ideas on how to use those classifications to help make decisions about health care. The implementation of casemix payments will improve efficiency within hospitals and improve the quality and quantity of the information available on what takes place in hospitals, and hence improve quality and outcome of health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth developed system&mdash;Australian national diagnosis related groups&mdash;would normally be used for acute in-hospital care under casemix payments. Other payment mechanisms&mdash;for example, per diem payments&mdash;would need to continue for longer term/non-acute patients, such as chronic psychiatric patients and nursing home type patients, until more precise episodic classification becomes viable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where hospitals and funds do not enter a contract arrangement, there will be a transition period during which the fund will be required to provide a benefit payment at a level determined by the fund. This will be an incentive for hospitals to enter into contracts, while providing protection for patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been suggestions that these provisions give too much power to the funds and that they may misuse this power in an anti-competitive way, say to advantage hospitals that they may own. The government is satisfied that the Trade Practices Act provides protection against anti-competitive action by any funds&mdash;and, in any case, the number of health fund owned hospitals, only about six per cent of private hospital beds, makes such anti-competitive action unlikely to be attractive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funds will be encouraged to contract with high quality, cost efficient hospitals. A fund with a large market share may be able to negotiate a lower price, and this is what competition is all about. However, the exercise of their market power must be consistent with the Trade Practices Act, which prohibits the use of such power to reduce competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of the introduction of this new approach is that consumers will be able to choose packages with lower premiums if they are happy to use the hospitals and doctors contracted by their fund. They will also be able to choose packages that cover them for the total cost of hospital treatment, eliminating the gap that often exists at the moment between the amount of the bill and the level of their benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is likely that most funds will cover most hospitals, there will be a range of products that vary according to the range of services and number of hospitals covered. For example, a product might cover all hospitals, or most of the major public and private hospitals, or a few small private hospitals according to the level of access consumers wish to have. In addition, consumers could choose between full coverage, an agreed level of co-payment for lower premiums, or products with known out-of-pocket payments similar to the current front-end deductible arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumers will be able to purchase a product that best suits their need, at a price that best suits their budget. There will be more choice&mdash;not less&mdash;and, for the first time, consumers will have information and power to exercise those choices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funds and hospitals will implement arrangements to avoid insured consumers unknowingly being admitted to hospitals not specifically covered by their health insurance product, and doctors will also need to play a role in referring patients to hospitals covered by the patient's health insurance product. However, for cases such as emergency admissions to non-contracted hospitals, funds will be obliged to make a payment based on average payments to contracted hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill requires health funds to offer a product which covers the full range of treatments and services in hospitals. This will ensure that people with high health needs have access to appropriate private insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of paragraph 29 of schedule 1 to the bill will enable funds and doctors to enter into contracts for the provision of medical services rendered in hospital. The contract may exclude out-of-pocket costs or allow for a predetermined amount to be borne by the patient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reform addresses one of the greatest concerns of private health fund members. Unlike the current arrangements, patients will know in advance of admission to hospital what medical expenses, if any, they will have to meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contracted doctors will not be permitted to raise bills outside of the contract, but these contracts will not be compulsory and contract payments may be made on whatever basis funds and doctors choose&mdash;for example, a percentage of the MBS fee, a retainer, or some other agreed payment. Members may purchase this type of coverage for contracted doctors on an add-on basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, therefore, this is not introducing an American style managed care system. Doctors will still be able to receive fee for service and the structure of our private hospital system will not change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does not introduce `open-ended' gap insurance either. Although funds may negotiate whatever fees they wish with a doctor, if their contracts are too generous higher premiums would result. Since higher premiums would lead to a decrease in market share, there is a strong incentive for funds to negotiate reasonable contract prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 69 of schedule 1 of the bill provides for an amendment to the Health Insurance Act 1973 to enable the 75 per cent Medicare benefit to be paid direct to the health fund for services rendered by contracted doctors. In-hospital services rendered by doctors who do not enter into a contract with a fund will continue to attract overall payments equal to 100 per cent of the MBS fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I repeat, the focus of this legislation is on strengthening consumer rights and on making private health insurance better value for money. The bill provides for the establishment of an independent complaints commissioner from 1 July 1995. The establishment of the commissioner will provide insured persons with access to an effective complaints handling mechanism which can investigate, conciliate and make recommendations in response to complaints about private health insurance products. A 008 telephone network will be put in place to provide insured persons with easy access to the commissioner no matter where they live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the tasks of the commissioner will be to provide input to a private patient charter which will be designed to assist consumers in obtaining specific information from funds, doctors, hospitals, my department and the complaints unit itself. The charter will also encourage doctors to inform patients of an estimate of their fees and of the fees of other doctors involved in a prospective episode of treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A separate bill, titled the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994, provides for health funds to pay a levy to finance the administration expenses of the complaints commission. Paragraph 70 of schedule 2 to the bill provides the Private Health Insurance Administration Council with the additional function of publishing information in relation to health funds' premiums, benefits and products to assist persons in making an informed choice about the product which best suits their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final group of amendments are to improve the operation of some elements of the current environment. Paragraphs 12 to 23 of schedule 2 of the bill remove the requirement for open membership organisations to conduct a separate health fund in each state. This measure will increase administrative efficiency and allow organisations to react quickly to changing circumstances. It will also reduce competitive differences between open and restricted membership organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 67 of the National Health Act 1953 requires organisations conducting health insurance business to be registered under the act and operate in conformity with community rating. This provision was introduced from 1 September 1985 in response to the growth in health insurance by general insurers which, by imposing restrictions on certain benefits and on age, had the capacity to offer lower premiums and hence attract the young and healthy members away from registered insurers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, there has been an increase in the incidence of health plans being operated in respect of employee groups. These plans are not caught by the National Health Act because either no underwriting of the liability or premiums are involved or such plans are conducted under a discretionary trust deed arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government remains committed to the principle of community rating. Paragraphs 9 to 11 of schedule 2 of the bill propose amendments to section 67 of the act which will require employers conducting such plans to register them under the act or cease to conduct the plans with effect from 1 July 1995. This will bring such plans into line with registered funds and, for example, require them to participate in the reinsurance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments would not prevent employers continuing to meet employees' premiums to a registered health fund. Paragraph 10 of schedule 2 of the bill contains a ministerial power to exempt certain schemes, for example where an employer meets health expenses not covered by employees who maintain appropriate registered health insurance cover. Currently, funds are required to notify the secretary within seven days after they change their rules, constitution or articles and such changes may be disallowed on a retrospective basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a means to further safeguard community rating, paragraph 43 of schedule 1 of the bill provides for changes to be notified prospectively. Advice about changes in premiums will need to be provided seven days before the day on which they are to apply while other changes to rules will need to be notified 60 days before the effective date. However, a ministerial discretion will be available to accept notifications for a lesser period where the changes provide for the introduction of new products in response to consumer demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity has also been taken under paragraph 61 of schedule 1 of the bill to modify the pre-existing ailment rule to reduce administrative difficulties for funds. This change is not expected to have any significant impact on members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decline in participation rates for private health insurance has attracted cries from the opposition parties, the AMA and industry groups for the government to subsidise the cost of private insurance by way of tax rebates. Persons on low incomes, such as pensioners, would gain no benefit from tax subsidies. Furthermore, such proposals ignore the fact that Medicare already provides funding for private patients. Any additional subsidy large enough to increase private insurance participation would cost more than treating the newly insured in the public system. Or, put another way, the massive budget cuts to public hospitals required to fund tax rebates would have a far greater impact than any increase in demand from former fund members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will place the health insurance industry in a position to work with hospitals, doctors and contributors to ensure the future of efficient and affordable private health insurance packages that offer both protection and value for money for consumers.

I must say that the minister read her bureaucratic speech quite nicely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say `Welcome Miss America' for the very good reason that the minister is taking us down the American track of managed care. The reasons for that will become apparent as we deal with the bill that she has introduced today. Let me say at the outset that the package she announced in August 1994, which these bills are meant to implement, in fact is different. These bills do not do what she said they would do back in 1994, either in outcome or in content. We can only expect that there will be need for further legislation to introduce the things which are simply not here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing is that the minister said in her second reading speech, she said in August 1994 and she says again and again that these packages will bring down the cost of premiums and therefore make it more attractive to people to insure, because it is certainly the cost of private health insurance premiums that has caused the rate of fund membership to plummet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the evidence from both people in the industry and people who were being denied consultation with the minister or her department&mdash;and that has certainly been a constant factor in all the submissions that I have received; and here are but some of them&mdash;is that there has been no adequate consultation, and these people want to have their point of view heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the health insurance funds those who are allegedly the beneficiaries of this legislation get more power. In the words of the minister, they get greater power to negotiate with hospitals and then doctors to screw down the price so that the funds can then charge a cheaper premium. The only thing is that, with the manner in which the bills will operate, premiums will not come down&mdash;and health fund after health fund has said that they will not come down; they will in fact go up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, we are moving a second reading amendment to the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill. If it is carried, the opposition will not decline the bill a second reading. The amendments require certain changes to be made to the bill which will make it fair and equitable. I will explain how that is to be done. It also provides that there be at least three questions which need to be examined by a Senate committee to see whether or not the bill will serve the ends which it is meant to serve. The first of those is a constitutional point: whether or not the legislation as introduced in fact amounts to a civil conscription as outlawed by our constitution under section 51(xxiiiA). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go right to the heart of it. The minister said she wants more competition. I am all for competition. She is going to introduce casemix funding as a basis of episode of care funding. We do not oppose that concept. But what we do oppose is the concept that the health funds in this country will be given unprecedented power that no other system of health funds has anywhere else in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It works this way: the minister told us that this legislation would enable health funds to enter into contracts to provide care for contributors. There is nothing to prevent health funds doing that at this very minute, as we speak&mdash;and, indeed, many have done precisely that, in Victoria in particular. In Victoria the evidence was that the premiums went up, and a small piece of logic will tell you why. Under a provider agreement there is a form of gap insurance&mdash;you can insure for the whole cost of an episode of care. But of course that means the funds have to actually pay more money out when the claims are made, and if the funds have to pay more money out it is logical to conclude that the premiums will go up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, we will have a whole system of complaints bureaucracy under this bill which enables the minister to: choose the complaints commissioner; tell him or her how much they will get by way of salary; what people employed by the commissioner can be chosen by the commissioner; choose the terms and conditions of employment; and second people from the department to back up the commissioner. Might I say, Minister, there would be nothing to prevent you from appointing your very good friend Mr Eastson, the man who presented the petition to the Western Australian parliament when you were the Premier, which was found to be untrue and yet it went in with your concurrence. You could appoint anyone you like. You could perhaps even give him another $200,000 like you gave him previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, Minister, I think we are entitled to take a good look at just what sort of person you might choose to appoint. But then you want the contributors to pay for the cost of this bureaucracy, and it can expand. We will be opposing the levy bill because it is a new tax and it is in a separate bill because it is a new tax. The constitution requires that all new taxes must be in a separate bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what is new in this bill to make it more attractive for private health insurance funds to negotiate preferred provider agreements with hospitals and/or doctors? I will tell you. They have the power not to pay any money to hospitals they do not in fact have a contract with. Let us look at the impact of that. It means if I want to have my appendix out my choice of doctor might be Dr Bloggs over there. But Dr Bloggs only operates in a hospital owned by Dr Lawrence. However, my health fund, to which I have been paying my premiums of over $1,000 a year, does not have a contract with Dr Lawrence's hospital; it has one with Dr Theophanous's hospital and a range of others. My Dr Bloggs does not operate anywhere else, so I cannot choose the doctor I want, and I cannot choose the hospital I want. My choice becomes more limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the minister, I actually have private health insurance. I have always had private health insurance because I believe I have an obligation to look after myself. Senator Richardson, when he was the minister, said that for Medicare to work&mdash;and I support Medicare&mdash;it was necessary that 40 per cent of the population be covered by private health insurance. Otherwise the strain on the public sector would be too great. The result of the strain being too great is that we have 112,000 Australians on a waiting list because they cannot get into the public hospitals because people who can afford to take out private health insurance have not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimate is that for every one per cent of people who leave private health insurance&mdash;and we are now down to 36.6 per cent&mdash;it costs the government, or rather the taxpayer because governments do not have any money, another $100 million in services that have to be provided in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister even admits to a figure of $60 million&mdash;that is, per year. I have asked the good minister, when she has come into the parliament twice a week, what she believes the critical mass is. Does she agree with her former colleague Senator Richardson? Is it 40 per cent? But she will not tell me. So all we have to go on is the caucus-ACTU working party paper that looked at private health insurance. It says that a worst case scenario is that it could fall to 20 per cent. If it falls to 20 per cent, if you accept the industry figure of $100 million per one per cent drop, then the minister has to find $1.6 billion per annum to make up the shortfall. On her own admitted figures, it is $1 billion a year. Where are we going to find that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said yesterday that the Medicare levy is outdated. Well she should say that, because it only raises less than 10 per cent of the health care bill. In this country it costs us $34 billion annually&mdash;$34,000 million. Of that, $15 billion comes from the federal coffers, $8 billion from the state coffers and $11 billion from the private sector, the pockets of private individuals. That of course includes health funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to these agreements. There is nothing  wrong with the agreements. They are a good idea. As I said, they can have them now. But, if we have such an agreement, the health fund is obliged under the existing National Health Act&mdash;good name for legislation that: National Health Act&mdash;to make a payment regardless of whatever hospital you go into. We do that by having something called the basic table. The minister prescribes how much has to be paid. It is a schedule to that act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health funds know the basic table is not enough to give people adequate care when they want to use a private hospital, so they have come up with something called supplementary tables. That enables them to pay more. But under this bill the minister gives the power to the health funds. If I&mdash;going back to my example of having my appendix out&mdash;go to the hospital of my choice and have the doctor of my choice, which are not covered by the provider agreement, then so far as the hospital cost is concerned my health fund can determine to pay as little as 50c and I have to pay the entire bill. What use is my health insurance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to move a second reading amendment here and then when the bill goes to the Senate have it immediately referred to a standing committee to investigate whether or not, among other things, the bills are constitutional&mdash;because they may not be legal. Secondly, it should decide whether the starting date, when the funds and the hospitals are supposed to have concluded their deals, can really be 1 July 1995&mdash;the experience in Victoria was that when the funds went to negotiate their agreements it took 12 months&mdash;or whether it finds another date is reasonable and recommends that. Thirdly, it should decide whether or not the structure of the payments under casemix is going to be adequate and also whether or not the question of privacy is adequately dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing Australians do not know is that every time we go to the doctor and he prescribes something for us and we use Medicare&mdash;whether it is bulk-billed or whether we pay a bit extra the Medicare component is there&mdash;all the details about us go onto the database of the Health Insurance Commission, which is owned by the department, here in Canberra. It is a database which contains all the details of our illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you go to a private hospital and you are not using Medicare your details remain private to you. To me, privacy is a most important issue, and one that I am quite passionate about. The HIC and something called a council are two groups that are entitled to get information under this legislation. Those two organisations are to have access to this information for the purpose of evaluation and modelling. There is no definition of evaluation and that information is not protected. My suggestion is&mdash;and I am foreshadowing the amendment&mdash;that the Privacy Commissioner who has been appointed to look after our privacy should bring down the guidelines on how that sensitive information is dealt with, not the minister. That would mean that for the first time the Privacy Commissioner is answerable to the parliament and not just to the executive government. That is a very important thing. We need the Privacy Commissioner to look after us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others have come up with a different suggestion and have said, `Well, perhaps it is better if we have an independent agency'&mdash;not government and not Big Brother having the information. This independent agency could supply the information when required by the department and the council for evaluation so that they can work better on casemix information. It would be a protection. It is important that the Senate looks at that question as well. There is no reason why these amendments cannot be moved and the bill be passed into law because the amendments do not stop the bill; they make it fairer and better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health funds own their own hospitals. There is a good incentive in this legislation for health funds to do a deal with their own hospitals and leave others out. It might be useful to put on the record the problem as it is known and perceived by a smallish rural, regional hospital. This hospital sees the situation as perhaps forcing it out of business. This is an example of the power that this bill, unless amended, gives to the funds. I have a letter signed by the chief executive officer of the Berwick hospital and it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Berwick Hospital:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*is located 40 kilometres south east of Melbourne within the most explosive `Growth Corridor' in Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*has two major private competitors within a 20 kilometre radius. Both are large private for profit hospitals and are owned by corporate entities (one with a health fund connection).</PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing wrong with having hospitals that are for profit. Our private hospitals basically come in as for profit, and that is why they are operated. We have not-for-profit hospitals which are conducted by charities such as St John of God, St Vincent's and others. Finally, we have the public structure. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hospital presently has provider agreements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>They are the ones that we have now and which are not dependent upon this legislation. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hospital presently has provider agreements with most health funds. however there is no guarantee that these arrangements will continue at the same level when the reforms are implemented by legislation. It is of concern that it would be of financial benefit to both our competitors if the agreements were not renewed . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I will read that again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it would be of financial benefit to both our competitors if the agreements were not renewed as it would give the opportunity for one of the larger groups to take over the hospital or for the hospital to close due to reduced financial returns.</PARA>
<PARA>The hospital sees that it can go out of business. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a small operator, Berwick Hospital will not have the negotiating powers or be in a position to counteract the influence over the Health Funds that the larger Hospital groups (such as Healthscope) may have, particularly when negotiating the provider agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, they are saying that the power is all on one side. They have nothing to fall back on. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Lawrence reforms will give the health fund this power to determine (through rebate) which Hospitals will survive or be financially "starved". The deletion of the basic table&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(the safety net for "all" hospitals)</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the one in the present act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">may assist the Health Funds in this process.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the provisions in this bill, getting rid of the safety net provided for in the current legislation, will assist the funds to put people out of business. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Reforms outline an appeal mechanism, however, when a Hospital accomplishes a small surplus for the year, say equivalent to approximately one month's expenditure, it would have little reserves to survive the twelve month appeal delay!</PARA>
<PARA>Good point: no cheap justice here. I go on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process of Medical Practitioners contracting will have similar effects on small independent Hospitals (such as Berwick) as described above regarding the financial arrangements. The public will attend facilities without "out of pocket" expenses. The larger "for profit" Hospitals will be able to offer Practitioners incentives to enter contracts and service only those Hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA>Power to say, as in the American system, `You've got to go to that hospital and you've got to have that doctor.' The chief executive officer continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, this package put forward by Dr. Lawrence will give the health funds unprecedented powers over small independent Hospitals, increase the funds profitability through reduced rebates to those Hospitals and add to the decline of people with health insurance due to the loss of the small "not for profit" institutions within their communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware of your discussions&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and thank you for the opportunity to put forward my views as Chief Executive Officer of a small acute hospital. I am deeply concerned for the survival of this community's Hospital given Dr. Lawrence's program and would be pleased to provide any further information that you may require.</PARA>
<PARA>A plea from the heart from a man who cares for his community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said it before: health is not a market; health is about pain and suffering. The reason there are 112,000 Australians on a waiting list is because they are adjudged to be wanting elective surgery. What does that mean? It means you are not about to die tomorrow, but it takes no account of pain or agony or suffering. On my desk I have a legion of letters from people saying, `We can't get in.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lawrence has said that this will make health insurance more attractive. The bottom line is: is she going to join up? She does not have any private health insurance but when she wanted to go to hospital, and when Mr Keating, who does not have private health insurance either, wanted to go to hospital, did they get in a queue? No, never; they slipped between the floral sheets of a private hospital. And they did it because they could afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating can afford a $2.2 million house. Dr Lawrence over here had $5,000 of taxpayers' money in her account for 15 months which she forgot about. You have to be pretty rich to forget 5,000 bucks. She gave it back when she was reminded. It came out of the same account that Mr Burke went to gaol for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister: is she going to join up? Is this package of hers so attractive that she is going to join up? Tell us. Is Mr Keating going to join up? After you paid for your private health stint, both of you could claim, after your first $1,000 of expenditure&mdash;at about 500 bucks a day it does not take long to get that up&mdash;a 20c in the dollar tax rebate. But do the struggling mums and dads paying private health insurance get any help? Never, and yet it is their premiums that kept that hospital bed available for you. Eighty per cent of the revenue that keeps private hospitals open comes from the private health insurance funds. Twelve per cent comes from people who have workers' comp, or like arrangements. Eight per cent of funds comes from the likes of Dr Lawrence and Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They cannot survive unless mums and dads are willing to pay their private health insurance. I am paying mine. I have always paid it. But, when this bill takes away my freedom to choose, is it going to be worth my while to keep private health insurance? How many other Australians are going to ask the same question? When the price goes up more and we get less, we can thank `Miss America'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The points which are outlined in the amendment to be moved by me&mdash;the drafting instructions for which are to be done subsequent to the Senate having an investigation to look at those points&mdash;will provide that the funds would have to pay a hospital that is not covered by a provider agreement 50 per cent of what they would have to pay to one that is. That would not cease in 1997 when the safety net goes, because up till 1997 a fund can elect to operate as it does now on the basic table and with its supplementary tables. Schedule 4 of this bill says that in 1997 that arrangement ceases. Our amendments would mean that the funds would have to go on paying at least 50 per cent. The Senate may decide it should be more&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but this would give protection to hospitals like Berwick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair, because even in the bill the minister has chosen to allow choice to exist with regard to medical services. If a doctor chooses not to sign up and to remain independent so that the relationship remains between the doctor and the patient and not between the doctor and the health fund, with the patient as the commodity, then the payment in perpetuity will remain as it is. That means that in a private hospital the Medicare payment will be 75 per cent of the MBS fee and the fund will provide 25 per cent. I require&mdash;and I think it is fair&mdash;that doctors inform patients of just how much any additional costs should be. I think financial consent is an important ingredient. It is not in the bill, but it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill attacks community rating, because it allows people to enter into agreements which say, `We will cover you for this amount of illness, but we won't include psychiatric treatment and hip replacement.' So the principle of community rating, which is basically that the young and the healthy subsidise the old and the sick, will be defeated because people will be able to elect to insure only for the things they might incur. That is called risk rating. That is the American system. We say in our amendment that community ratings shall stay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals foreshadowed in the second reading amendment allow the bills to proceed but make them fairer. They take away some powers of the minister. Under this bill, once we have gone through this protracted process of the health funds having done deals with the hospitals and/or doctors, the minister can intervene. She can say, `I don't really like your agreements. I will have a bit of intervention here. I will change things.' We take that power away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want the Privacy Commissioner to have the say about privacy, not the minister. We do not think it is fair that the contributors have to pay for the complaints commissioner, because basically the complaints will be about the government's own policy. We think the government ought to wear the cost. We think that there should be an appeal against this commissioner, who has the power to refer things to other people and has the power to take documents about anyone. We think there should be quick and speedy justice and appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Everything we are proposing will make the bills fairer and more equitable.

She just gets a few letters here and there or goes and talks to her mates in the AMA or in a couple of other particular sectors.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was the co-convenor of the caucus-ACTU working group on health, which the shadow minister mentioned. That group engaged in detailed analysis of private health insurance.

They grab hold of a couple of myths and they base their whole policy on those couple of myths. The government does not do that. The legislation we are debating here today is based on a sound, factual analysis of what the real issues are in private health insurance, and it deals with how we can address the needs of private health insurance without attacking the fundamental basis of the public health system. </PARA>

That is not what is happening. The people who are leaving private health insurance are those who are not using their private health insurance because, in large measure, they are not utilising health services. They are finding that spending $1,500 a year on private health insurance is a waste of money because they are not using medical services.

So there is no evidence that all of these people leaving private health insurance are suddenly going on to the public hospital waiting lists. There has been a continual growth in the utilisation of private hospitals all through this period. The problem for opposition members and for those who argue for things like tax rebates, government subsidies and public subsidies for private health insurance is that they keep confusing the issues of the financing and funding of the health system, and the provision of services. They are two separate issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other argument those opposite continue to expound is that there are two totally separate systems: a private health system that operates totally independently&mdash;people take out private health insurance and that is how they access the system&mdash;and a public health system. They argue that they are two separate systems. Wrong, wrong, wrong! They are totally intermeshed. Medicare is based on the private delivery of health services. People can go to their private doctor of choice. If the doctor bulk-bills, then the government pays the doctor directly. That Medicare service is publicly funded through the tax system. If the doctor does not bulk-bill, people can go to Medicare and claim a rebate on the fee. You automatically have, just with that delivery of ordinary GP services, a mixture of public and private systems in financing and in delivering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Within our public hospitals, we have private beds and public beds. We have private doctors who deliver services in public hospitals. It is a totally intertwined system. Private hospitals do not offer the complete broad array of all medical services. The public hospital system does, but the private hospital system, in large measure, offers very narrow, very specific services. You cannot go to a private hospital to get absolutely everything carried out that you might need. In large measure, it is the public hospital system that leads the way in medical research and the most expensive cardiac and cancer medicine&mdash;all of those very expensive medical and hospital services. They are all largely done in the public sector, not the private sector. So that is another myth that we constantly hear in this argument; that they are two separate independent systems. They are not, never have been and never will be. They are very much intertwined and intermixed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The third myth concerns the shadow minister trotting out statements about the minister or the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) taking out health insurance and bludging on the system. All of these are ridiculous comments, and we hear them all the time. She believes the myth that there are hoards of rich people bludging on the system and not taking out private health insurance. Let us look at the facts instead of the myths that are constantly perpetuated in this argument. Only 19.5 per cent of people whose incomes are over $1,000 a week do not have private health insurance. More than 80 per cent of those people who are on incomes of $50,000 or more have private health insurance. Out of those 19.5 per cent, the vast  bulk of people continue to use private health services. </PARA>

There is no evidence at all that higher income earners are clogging up the public health system. When they use the public health system&mdash;as is their right because, as higher income earners, they are paying a much higher contribution to the tax wealth of this country through our progressive tax system and, therefore, to the support of the health system&mdash;it is because the private system does not provide the services.

What we are doing in this legislation will make that private health insurance package a much better and more attractive product, a product that people will be willing to stay with and think is worth while.

We hear the argument that somehow if we introduce tax credits, benefits or something like that, hundreds of thousands of people will start flocking back into private health insurance. They will suddenly say, `Yes, this is a great deal.' The problem is that tax credits or tax rebates do not operate for low income earners. The vast majority of pensioners pay very little tax and there is no detail given about how these tax credits will cut in. There is absolutely no evidence&mdash;it is another myth&mdash;in this country or internationally that introducing some form of very expensive tax credit system will cause a massive increase in private health insurance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We recognise that there are demands and stresses and strains from time to time in the public health system; and it is unacceptable that people have to wait some time for surgery. We accept that and we are working to deal with it. But you do not fix the demands on the public health system and its ability to cope by taking $2 billion to $3 billion out of it and putting it into the private system. You do not fix the public system by cutting its funds and reducing the amount of money available. That is the other fundamental flaw in the opposition argument. It does not add up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have yet to hear an explanation from anyone that taking $1 billion, $2 billion or $3 billion&mdash;I cannot be more specific because I do not know exactly what the opposition intends with its tax credit policy&mdash;out of the public system suddenly fixes all the problems there. I do not know how the opposition can talk in this place and outside about this great tax credit system that will fix all the woes of the public health system. If anybody can explain how cutting $1 billion to $3 billion from the public health system is going to fix the demands on it, that person should be a Rhodes scholar and must have some very great creative logic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation that we are debating here today has a very strong emphasis on the rights and needs of the contributors to the private health funds.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former shadow minister keeps talking about the power of the health funds and what dreadful power the health funds will have. Health funds are not private companies; they are organisations made up of contributors. They are not profitable organisations. Nobody gets a profit statement at the end of each year, with profits being distributed to shareholders. Health funds are owned by the contributors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are about giving those contributors more say on the costs of medicine, the way in which medical services are provided, what they are charged for, what types of services they are able to get, and what they are covered for. We are giving them more right to raise concerns about the method of charging for those services and about the prices they are charged.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Labor remains straitjacketed by ideology, the need for reform to stop the exit from private health insurance has had quite some build-up. The former minister and then senator, Graham Richardson, said on 10 September 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think my primary role is to administer Medicare, and that means public access in public hospitals. That has to be the thrust of all that I do, but you can't do it properly unless there's a vibrant private sector and I think that's what has been missed over the course of the last few years . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The former minister had the courage to recognise the real situation in the public health system and in public hospitals, when he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One reason why those waiting lists are long, why it is such a difficulty, is that we've just let private health insurance numbers get too low . . . the drift into the public system, which we've heralded as such a great system, has I think gotten to the stage now where we can't take it any more.</PARA>
<PARA>Graham Richardson was concerned, as is the coalition, at the dramatic fall-off in those who have private health insurance. In round figures, the fall has been about 20 per cent in the last 10 years. Of great concern but of no real surprise is the increase in the number of those aged 65 and over who are taking out private health insurance. For the year 1992-93 the figure is up by 12,000 to 844,000, while the number for those aged 64 or less fell by 208,000 to 6,124,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that we have an ageing population. Statistics tell us that every day. We know that this ageing population will require additional health care, but this government does not give one hint that it is planning for that&mdash;in fact, quite the opposite. It says whatever is necessary in the weeks before an election to hang on to power and then, once elected, it is back to all talk and no real action or reform. Graham Richardson, in reflecting on the years of Labor's rule, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There ought not to be a rule in Australian politics against thinking ahead. We have operated in a fog for a number of years in which that rule has I think been observed, by and large by too many of us. We think three years between elections&mdash;we can do something in the first, try and wrap it up in the second, and in the third&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which we are in now&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">spend the time talking about what we will do next time. That's a pretty pathetic way to run Government.</PARA>
<PARA>Free of the constraints of being a Labor senator, Graham Richardson has had even more to say. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> on 13 September 1994, he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Convincing the Labor Party that the rapid decline in the number of Australians who take out private health insurance is any sort of problem is a very difficult task. Contemplating any change to the arrangements for Medicare can be downright hazardous for an ambitious health minister. The final unveiling of Carmen Lawrence's new reforms for private health insurance provided a predictable outcome . . . they also stop short of addressing the problem.</PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor health ministers are not allowed to believe that the decline in private health insurance (the percentage of Australians covered is down to 37.2% and the economic recovery appears to have done little to stop the exodus) is anything other than a vote of confidence in Medicare. They are also not allowed to believe that the public hospital system will ever find itself unable to cope with the influx of formerly insured citizens, which one day will create one hell of a problem.</PARA>
<PARA>Having identified Labor's inability to look beyond ideology to reality, Mr Richardson continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dropouts from private health insurance are mostly younger and healthier people. They present no problem now because, apart from incidents of trauma, they are unlikely to need the services of public hospitals. Eventually of course they will age, get sick more often and the nation will face a very serious problem.</PARA>
<PARA>Sadly, the current Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) will not face up to this very serious problem. Today I have quite deliberately quoted someone from the Labor side of politics because all too often, and including the last speaker, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), those opposite dismiss arguments from this side of the House as being political. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is supposedly about reforms but it is full of problems. The minister claims that this legislation will reverse the trend of declining numbers with private health insurance. I argue the direct opposite. People are opting out because of the increasing cost of premiums. Dr John Loy, the First Assistant Secretary of the Department of Human Services and Health, told the AMA-convened forum last October that this legislation was not intended to reduce the cost of premiums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that this legislation is properly scrutinised by a Senate committee. There has been little community debate and no consumer consultation. Those working in the system have expressed their reservations and fears. This legislation has the potential to change the way private health care is delivered in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mindful of the responsibilities and obligations I have being a member in this place, I have done some consulting in my own electorate. The President of the Australian Private Hospitals Association and Chief Executive of Adelaide's Ashford Community Hospital, and also a constituent of mine, Mr Geoff Sam says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this legislation will result in private hospitals facing a bureaucratic nightmare and big rises in administrative costs of at least 15%.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Sam claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the costs would inevitably result in higher costs to consumers. This is the American style health system and in America, administrative costs ballooned.</PARA>
<PARA>As Mr Sam puts it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An army of administrators and bureaucrats will send costs up leading to premiums going up with the result that more people will opt out putting additional pressure on the public system.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems that he and the former Senator Richardson have something to agree about. Mr Sam is also concerned for the chronically and mentally ill `as hospitals will be attracted to only take fast turnover patients'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also discussed this legislation with Mr Craig Hall, who is the President of the Private Hospitals Association of South Australia and Chief Executive of St Andrew's Hospital in Adelaide. Mr Hall supports the claim made by Mr Sam that this legislation will result in further administrative costs and the resulting increase in premiums. He further claims that consumers may not be able to choose their hospital and their doctor&mdash;the very reason that people take out private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be honest, I must say that I have had a letter from Mutual Community&mdash;a large health insurer from South Australia&mdash;seeking an assurance that I would not reject this legislation. I have also received correspondence from the Australian Health Insurance Association Ltd along similar lines. The letter claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation will allow health funds an opportunity to halt that dramatic escalation in the unit cost of hospitalisation.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, they recognise the power they are going to have with the purse strings. But the funds are not united in favour of this legislation. MBF has written to me expressing concerns, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reform proposals do nothing to address the fundamental problem of funding in the private sector and little or no genuine consultation with the users of the health system has occurred or is envisaged. Research commissioned by MBF and conducted by the Roy Morgan Research Centre shows that the community is largely unaware of the proposals and their likely effects.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Greg Gardiner, the Chairman of the Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia, HCF, in the 1994 HCF general report, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if increasing competition is based solely on cost containment this may lead to consumers being worse off. There is a danger that quality may be sacrificed to control costs.</PARA>
<PARA>Should this legislation pass without amendment in the Senate, doctors will have greater incentives to look after the financial interests of the health funds than the health interests of their patients. I would not expect doctors to neglect the interests of their patients, but it is worrying that such incentives are being quite deliberately put into the health system for the future.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation dramatically increases the power of the health insurance funds in a way which is contrary to the interests of patients and takes Australia perilously close to US-style managed care where profits come before patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has a lot to answer for in the problems facing the private health sector and now pretends so dishonestly that this legislation is necessary for reform and change. This government has directly contributed to increases in the costs of private health insurance by shifting the cost of 25 per cent of the medical fee for in-patient care to the privately insured. This amounts to at least $200 million. It has also withdrawn the bed day subsidies to private hospitals at a cost of about $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further amount of $100 million has been taken out of the private health sector by withdrawing the federal government's contribution to the reinsurance pool. Claims have been made about out-of-pocket expenses and the need for legislation to fix it. Legislation is not necessary to fix it. I cannot make that point more clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Checks made with private hospitals in Adelaide provide an accurate picture rather than a bureaucratic or government story. Because of arrangements already in existence&mdash;and these are arrangements between those funds and those private hospitals; and I understand the same occurs in other states&mdash;there are no out-of-pocket expenses for bed fees or theatre fees. There are in fact no out-of-pocket expenses for pathology, because that is being provided with the schedule fee being charged. But there are gap expenses for physiotherapy, radiology and some doctors' fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have learnt that there can be out-of-pocket expenses of up to $900 for a patient having a hip replacement should that patient be allergic to stainless steel and need a titanium prosthesis. I understand this may be necessary for one in 50 patients requiring hip replacement surgery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the government has something to answer for. It has allowed the medical benefit schedule to be eroded. One effect of this legislation is to shift further costs, those that arise because of the inadequate Medicare rebates, on to Australians who purchase private health insurance. These people are being hit on all sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should do as its own ACTU-caucus working party has recommended and establish an independent review mechanism for setting medical benefits schedule fees. Contracts between health insurers and medical practitioners are not in the best interests of consumers. The arrangements pit individual medical practitioners against multimillion dollar corporations with enormous resources to deploy to achieve their objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumers only need to ask themselves whether they would be happy to have the insurance company through which their car is insured decide where and by whom their car would be serviced and repaired. I suggest they would not. They should then be prompted to think of how they should have some control over their own destiny when it comes to their health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does provide for billing reform. However, only in circumstances where a doctor has a contract with the fund to charge at a particular level can there be access to the Medicare billing&mdash;HIC&mdash;system. Only a fund can direct bill the HIC billing system. The government is using this as an artificial device to force people into preferred insurance packages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who do not attend contracted doctors or who do not take out Commonwealth preferred packages are forced to claim their medical rebates at two locations. It should be remembered that many of these consumers are old, sick and frail and find such negotiations and claims difficult to manage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of billing arrangements, it is high time that this was made less complicated for consumers. Most people have come to grips with the 85 per cent of schedule fee rebate for a visit to the doctor for those out of hospital and with responsibility for the additional costs. But the billing system and paying of accounts for patients in hospital causes confusion and concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim for the 75 per cent Medicare rebate for medical services while in hospital, to be followed by the claim to the health insurer for 25 per cent of the schedule fee and then making up the gap or difference, can be very complicated for consumers&mdash;often at a time when they are least able to cope. All too often doctors have not discussed financial arrangements with their patients nor thought it necessary to explain this minefield. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those involved in providing health care are familiar with the system&mdash;consumers are infrequently patients and while ill and frail are least able to handle these complicated billing arrangements. I would therefore encourage doctors and, in some instances, hospitals to not only give verbal advice to their patients and ensure informed financial consent for procedures and treatment but also enclose a simple explanation of this minefield with accounts. To do so would not require legislation but good commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no true reforms in this legislation. It is ironic that in the campaign before the last federal election, Labor scurrilously claimed that the coalition would introduce US-style health care. That was never going to happen. Now the minister through these so-called reforms is pushing US-style health care down the throats of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was good to see the minister here today speaking on the first piece of health legislation for which she has come into this chamber. As the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) said, she normally leaves it to her parliamentary secretary who, as I have said in the past, has really tried pretty hard. But it was good to see her front up. I am sorry she was not here to learn from what consumers and those working in the industry have had personally to say to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When checking her appearances in this House, I actually discovered that this is only the fourth time she has spoken in this chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her speech, the minister claims no change in structure to the private hospitals. Again, my own consultations reveal otherwise. As I have already mentioned, there will be administrative changes and costs. But what of those hospitals&mdash;and this has all been put to me in the last 24 hours&mdash;that will suffer from the ever empowered and over-empowered health funds which will be given the opportunity and the power to decide, should this legislation pass, those hospitals that are no longer useful to them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been claimed by the industry in South Australia that community hospitals&mdash;and I stress community hospitals, which are not for profit hospitals&mdash;like Blackwood community, Glenelg community and Northern community will be under real threat. These hospitals may not be important to the government or to health funds but they are important to their local communities and are sacred sites because they have been there for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has failed to consult adequately. I trust that a Senate committee will not only thoroughly examine this legislation and give it close scrutiny but also listen carefully to all the players in the field, including consumers. The good health of all Australians is too important to just have legislation like this rushed through without proper consideration and amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When bureaucrats look at health and how it is funded and managed they see statistics. For those who work in the industry and those of us who represent our electorates, we know it is not just statistics. It is people. It is ageing people who are going to require greater assistance and greater care. It is people, as the member for Mackellar has said, who are suffering and who are in pain. It is people on waiting lists. It is people who are afraid of becoming sick. It is people who are just scared of the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us know of those older people, even pensioners, who, I would argue, do without what many of us would consider the necessities of life so that they can have private health insurance, because they are scared of not having their choice of doctor and hospital.

<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill proposes the repeal of the Audit Act 1901 and deals with the transitional and consequential matters arising from the repeal of that act and the enactment of proposed replacement legislation: namely, the Auditor-General Act 1994, the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1994 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Act 1901 is a pervading, operational act that gives flesh to certain basic constitutional requirements for the raising and spending of money by the Commonwealth and, to that end, provides a procedural framework for day-to-day financial administration and audit across the whole spectrum of Commonwealth activities. Its repeal and replacement, therefore, have an extensive impact. This bill is intended to permit an orderly transition to the new framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, this bill provides for the formal transfer, as appropriations, of balances from the Audit Act's existing fund accounting structure to the new structure established by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act 1994; the continuation in office of the person who may be the Auditor-General as at 1 July 1995; the continuation of the existing arrangements for the position of independent auditor as auditor of the Australian National Audit Office; the continuation for the time being, until regulations under the replacement legislation come into operation, of the current safeguards, as agreed by parliament, under section 70D of the Audit Act 1901, in relation to the nature of audit and financial reporting disclosures for the security and intelligence agencies; and the making of regulations to cover a range of situations, at a procedural level, should it be needed, to demonstrate legal certainty to other parties so as to support a smooth transition to the new legislative framework&mdash;for example, for the continuation of the myriad contractual and other arrangements entered into under the authority of the repealed act, such as operating bank accounts, contract audits in progress, debtors' repayments by instalments, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill's extensive impact, however, can be seen in the schedule to the bill&mdash;in the proposed consequential amendments to the relevant provisions of the more than 100 other acts which refer in specific ways to the current Audit Act. The proposed amendments will replace those acts' Audit Act references with provisions that appropriately link them to the framework of the new financial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to those Commonwealth authorities for which the schedule specifies consequential amendments to their enabling legislation so as to link those authorities to the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1994, it should be noted that the list is not exhaustive. The authorities are only those whose enabling legislation reflects part XI of the Audit Act 1901. A further transitional bill will be necessary to create the necessary linkages to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1994 for the 40 or so bodies whose enabling legislation does not reflect part XI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of this bill's introduction into the House last sitting, there was no reason to expect that the then incumbent Auditor-General would not be the person in place at the proposed transition date of 1 July 1995. Consequently, the relevant transitional clause was drafted accordingly&mdash;that is, having regard to the proximity of the incumbent's age to 65, it was not considered necessary to also specify a fixed term for the continued appointment. However, with the office of Auditor-General now vacant, and on the reasonable expectation that someone will be appointed to that office before 30 June, there is now a need to be somewhat more circumspect in the transitional provision, to ensure that the intention reflected in the Auditor-General Bill for a maximum seven-year appointment term is honoured. I therefore foreshadow that the government will be proposing an amendment to clause 8 to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of a bill to replace the Audit Act should be marked as an event of particular significance in the history of the Commonwealth parliament. Apart from the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, the Audit Act is the oldest law passed by parliament that is still in operation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long title of the Audit Act describes its purpose to be:</PARA>

This country has been well served by the financial principles established through its provisions, because it has indeed kept every Commonwealth government since Federation financially honest in more than just a rhetorical sense. Over nine decades, there have been countless departmental officials and auditors, and not a few parliamentarians, who have confidently looked to the Audit Act as both the shield and the sword of Commonwealth financial integrity. I am sure that none of them, were they here today, could have any doubt that the framework to be created by the legislation that is replacing the Audit Act will not only preserve that financial integrity but strengthen it. In that spirit I am very pleased to commend this bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1994 is a further instalment in the updating of the Commonwealth government's accountability and auditing framework. This bill proposes to repeal the Audit Act 1901 and deals with the transitional and consequential matters arising from the repeal of that act and the enactment of replacement legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition was pleased to see that the position of John Taylor was secured by the transitional bill. Given the effectiveness of Mr Taylor in exposing the government's waste and ineptness&mdash;in itself a full-time job, I might add&mdash;it was to be expected that the government would take the opportunity to install one of its lackeys. Sadly for the cause of balanced scrutiny, Mr Taylor has now left the office of Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vital for good government that his replacement will insist on the same high standards as shown by Mr Taylor and will carry out the function of Commonwealth auditor in the same balanced and professional manner. I can assure the government that a professional, unbiased auditor is the only thing the coalition will settle for. We will not settle for any political hack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a way, of course, that the government can ensure that the next Auditor-General is free of any claim of bias and is acceptable to the parliament as opposed to just the ALP. The solution is to seek the approval of the Leader of the Opposition in the selection. I do not just mean to consult with him; I mean to seek his approval. We will not stand in the way of a fair and reasonable appointment. So I throw this challenge down to the government: let us not politicise this vital appointment; rather, let us seek a bipartisan consensus and join together in selecting the right person for the job. I await the government's response with eager anticipation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This transitional bill is part of a package of bills designed to improve accountability and financial management for the Commonwealth. This government has already failed the test of accountability and financial management. On the financial management side we have numerous examples of waste. Let me just refresh the memory of honourable members with a few examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the financial disaster associated with Casselden Place at a cost to the taxpayer of some $71 million; we have $35 million wasted by the Defence Housing Authority through holding over 2,000 vacant houses and also paying rent for properties which it did not occupy; we have the lost savings of some $37 million through poor cash management practices; and we have the $170 million spent on consultancies so that ex-public servants can tell current public servants how to do their jobs. There are, of course, other examples but I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you get the idea from the over $300 million worth of stupidity I have just given you examples of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of accountability we also have a failed government. Again, let me refresh the House's memory: we have that great example of the sports rorts where the government blatantly used taxpayers' funds for political purposes and, rather than face the issue, it fought against the findings until the bitter end when the former member for Canberra finally resigned from the ministry; and we have the credit card disaster with rampant fraud and abuse, including misplaced sunglasses, wristwatches and the acquisition of other matters on the government credit card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the notorious example of the National Media Liaison Service. This example deserves special attention and special mention. This government employs a media unit ostensibly to spread the word on government policy. In reality it is a propaganda unit made up of political hacks dedicated to the return of the ALP to government. It does this by emphasising government strengths&mdash;which is not a big job, I might add, in its own right&mdash;and gathering dirt on anyone else, including the coalition. And who pays for this? It is not the Australian Labor Party; it is not the affiliated unions; it is not from donations&mdash;it is paid for by the taxpayer, by the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not money that goes to education, to preventing people suffering on hospital waiting lists or to building roads; in other words, the hard-earned money of ordinary Australians is not being used for the benefit of Australia or them, as it should be. Taxpayers' money is being used purely for the benefit of this government, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) deserves the condemnation of this House for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the Auditor-General wants to audit the National Media Liaison Service&mdash;or aNiMaLS, as it is more appropriately known. He wants to do this after the government has introduced new bills for greater accountability and talked a lot in this House about the need for greater accountability. What happens? The government blocks it. It stops it dead in its tracks, the excuse being that there is no legislative basis. Who blocks it&mdash;the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), who is the junior minister to the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley). Where was the Minister for Finance&mdash;the person who drew up the audit bills and spoke so much about the need for greater accountability?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Minister for Finance cares so much about accountability&mdash;and if aNiMaLS was a legitimate use of taxpayers' money, providing clear benefits for Australians&mdash;why did he not instruct his junior minister to allow the audit? Why did he not follow through with the spirit of the new bills rather than hide behind the technical details of the existing legislation? The answer is simple. The Minister for Finance is not in the least bit interested in taxpayer value for money and accountability. He is more than happy being part of a self-serving government for mates, which will use whatever means necessary, say whatever is necessary and waste whatever money is needed to stay in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aNiMaLS case simply reinforces what we saw when the Auditor-General Bill 1994 was debated in this House. In that instance, the coalition parties sought to amend the bills to give the Auditor-General greater independence and access. In blind panic at the thought of a truly independent Auditor-General, the government voted it down. How ironic that aNiMaLS came up just after this grubby little incident on the need for greater accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Minister for Finance and the government showed their true colours. It is a government which fears accountability for the simple reason that it would fail the test time and again. It is a government which knows that waste of taxpayers' money is rampant. New paintings for the cabinet room spring to mind as one example. It is a government which knows that large sums of money are wasted for blatant political purposes rather than spent in the national interest. It is a government which uses taxpayers' money to appease various interest groups. It knows that the Australian people would not tolerate it were it to be exposed, so it inhibits accountability and runs from scrutiny like Dracula from sunlight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is a failure when it comes to accountability and financial management. The failed record of accountability fits with the government's failings across a range of issues. On economic policy, it has singularly failed the Australian people. This country needs sustained growth to repair the damage caused by the Keating-developed recession, which was the worst recession in 60 years. From our economically illiterate Prime Minister, we get another boom-bust cycle. At a time when we still have 790,000 unemployed people and are desperately in need of sustained growth in investment, we have a government putting up interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when the current account deficit has blown out of manageable proportions and when the nation desperately needs savings, we have a government maintaining a huge borrowing program and draining national savings. Despite the rampant growth in spending&mdash;the real cause of the budget deficit&mdash;there is no move to cut spending. We will instead get more taxes. This mob is about putting up taxes, not cutting expenditure. This is despite ALP promises during the election campaign to not lift taxes and assurances that initiatives could be funded without lifting taxes. But the speed with which the government then broke these promises after cheating its way back into office is now legendary. At a time when our export performance has stalled and when the economy is in need of further measures to lift international competitiveness, the government has stalled on economic modernisation and reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On social policy, the self-titled egalitarian Labor Party has overseen a dramatic polarisation of our society and an ever widening gap between the rich and poor. We see indigenous Australians living in appalling Third World conditions, despite years of ALP platitudes and promises. We see growing hospital waiting lists, despite ALP rhetoric about caring for health needs. We see hopelessness in the eyes of Australian youth as they struggle to find meaningful employment in the face of mounting odds. Still, the government tells us that it is all going to plan and that it has the solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hate to rain on the government's parade, but everything is not okay. Government members do not have the answers, and it is not going to plan. They have failed as a government. They have comprehensively failed at macro-economic strategy. They have failed micro-economic reform. Now they can add their failure of accountability. They are a tired and failed lot, waiting to be put out of their misery. At the first opportunity, that is just what the Australian people intend to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the comments of the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) yesterday during  question time regarding his pleasure at the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) remaining opposition spokesperson on finance have been supported today by the member himself. Clearly, he does not provide much opposition at all to the Minister for Finance. The minister is a very capable person, as everyone in this place knows&mdash;except for the member for Forrest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the member's comments today indicate quite clearly that he has not done his homework on this legislation&mdash;as was the case when the original bills went through this place. His reference to the audit report on the government credit card is clearly flawed. He referred to a number of items, one of which was the purchase of sunglasses. On thorough examination, it was shown that those sunglasses were purchased for our defence forces serving in the Middle East. Some other reasons were suggested for the purchase of those sunglasses, but they were purchased for a very genuine reason for our defence personnel&mdash;and rightly so. There was no suggestion of wrongdoing or anything in that regard. I am surprised that the member for Forrest has not corrected that particular assumption since then. I will come to some other  comments of the member for Forrest later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I welcome the opportunity, particularly as the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, to speak this afternoon to the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1994. The bill proposes to repeal the Audit Act 1901 and deals with transitional arrangements arising from the repeal of that act and the enactment of its replacement legislation. The replacement legislation consists of the Auditor-General Bill 1994, the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994, and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994. It is proposed that the amendment bill and the replacement legislation will come into operation on 1 July 1995, although that depends on when the replacement legislation is passed by the Senate and when the amendment bill is passed by both houses of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The replacement legislation was the subject of report 331 by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The legislation was referred to the JCPA. We thoroughly investigated the legislation and provided a report to the House. That report contained 39 recommendations of changes to the legislation, many of which were subsequently adopted by the government. The committee welcomes that course. We certainly put in a lot of work. The government's action showed its willingness to consult with a lot of people. The reference to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts was a very important reference. We had the opportunity to go through matters on a bipartisan basis. I congratulate and thank all the members. They worked very much in a bipartisan manner to ensure that we obtained the accountability that was required for our proposals. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8J4">Mr LES SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government did not accept all the recommendations, as one would expect, but certainly it accepted a majority of them. The intention of the amendments is to provide for the formal transfer, as appropriations, of balances from the Audit Act's existing fund accounting structure to the new structure established in the Financial Management and Accountability Bill. The bill also allows for the continuation of the existing arrangements for appointment of the Auditor-General and the Independent Auditor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also continues the myriad of contractual and other arrangements entered into under the authority of the Audit Act, such as operating bank accounts, contract audits in progress, debtors repayments by instalments, et cetera. In its large schedule of regulations, the amendment bill lists consequential changes to over 100 acts that will be affected by the transition of the new legislation. So it is quite comprehensive, it is a complex matter and it is a very important area of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill deals with the role of the Auditor-General and the appointment of the Auditor-General. Over the Christmas-New Year period, Mr John Taylor, the Auditor-General, announced his decision to retire. On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I extend greetings and best wishes to Mr Taylor. Whilst Mr Taylor might have been controversial from time to time, there was no doubt about his commitment to the task that he had as Auditor-General. It is a very important task. That is why this legislation is before the House, and that is why the government&mdash;and particularly the Minister for Finance&mdash;holds accountability in such high regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put on the record my best wishes to Mr Taylor in his retirement. The members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts have worked very closely with Mr Taylor, as the committee and the Australian National Audit Office need to have a good working relationship. That relationship has been developed. We have not always agreed with the Auditor-General or with the findings of the audit office, but that is understandable. However, in the main we have been able to work together in the best interests of the Commonwealth. That is the role with which we are all charged in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure Mr Taylor will enjoy his retirement. I wish him and his wife and family well. He has made a major contribution to accountability in the Commonwealth arena and to the Public Service over his lifetime. I thank you for your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker. Given that Mr Taylor's position is actually mentioned in the bill, it was appropriate to take this opportunity to wish him well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of Mr Taylor's unexpected retirement, which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) mentioned in his speech, the government has proposed an amendment to the amendment bill. The Auditor-General Bill states that an Auditor-General will not be able to serve in office for longer than seven years. That recommendation was made by the JCPA in its report No. 331. It was assumed that Mr Taylor would have to resign in 1995 when he turned 65 and that his successor would be appointed after enactment of the Auditor-General Bill, at which time the seven-year limit would automatically apply. However, it is now unlikely that Mr Taylor's replacement will be appointed before the Auditor-General Bill is enacted. Consequently, the amendment bill also needs to include the seven-year limit on tenure, in line with the intention of the Auditor-General Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the appointment of the Auditor-General, the existing Audit Act does not provide for the consultation process referred to by the honourable member for Forrest. The new bill does provide for consultation with the Leader of the Opposition, or his or her nominee, the Minister for Finance and also the chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing act, the government does not have to consult with those people in appointing an Auditor-General. The appointment is made by the Prime Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Finance. However, I will be surprised if there is not some sort of consultation, given the goodwill of the current Minister for Finance. I am sure that he would want to be involved in that. Given the goodwill of the government and our commitment to accountability, I would not envisage any great problems there. But at the end of the day, no matter what process it takes, I can assure the honourable member for Forrest that the government, in appointing a new Auditor-General, will take into consideration the importance of the position and that the best person will be appointed, irrespective of whom the government needs to consult with. We can rest assured that the government will show goodwill in making this appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other items here that I wish to mention, particularly in relation to the ABC and the SBS. Clause 28 of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill empowers the responsible minister to notify the directors of the Commonwealth authority of general policies of the Commonwealth government that apply to the authority. In submissions to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquiry, the ABC and the SBS expressed deep concern that this clause could threaten their editorial and programming independence. That subject was canvassed quite extensively during our inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Department of Finance advised the committee at a public hearing that the consequential amendments legislation would make it abundantly clear that this clause would not affect the editorial policy and independence of the two agencies. I refer specifically to the evidence given by the Department of Finance at page 384 of the committee transcript, for those who wish to check that. This took place in Canberra on 17 August 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to note that this amendment bill amends both the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991, stating in both that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister may also notify the Directors of general policies of the Commonwealth Government under section 28 of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1994. However, the Minister must not notify the Directors of general policies that would affect the content or scheduling of programs.</PARA>
<PARA>That paragraph is in items 120 and 829 of the schedule to the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill. These amendments should reassure the directors of both the ABC and the SBS that their editorial independence will not be threatened. Again, this shows the goodwill of the government, in seeking to avoid any undue problems in that area. It is important that the ABC and the SBS have their editorial independence and I do not think anyone would have any great difficulty with that concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report No. 331, to which I have already referred, the committee noted that consequential legislation would have to be passed to repeal the Audit Act and detail consequential amendments to the enabling legislation of many Commonwealth authorities and companies, in order to remove inconsistencies with the three bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee concluded that its report would focus on the bills themselves and would consider any difficulties with the consequential legislation and regulations as and when they occurred. I believe that the amendment bill and the proposed government amendments to the bill do not give rise to any inconsistencies with the committee's report No. 331, and I welcome that. I note that there are still further elements to the new legislative regime to be put in place. A further miscellaneous amendment bill will be necessary to complete the extension of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill to all Commonwealth authorities. Regulations will be needed to flesh out the principles espoused in the new legislation; and the finance minister's orders will need to be issued to provide the operational details to support the legislation. I am sure other members of this House look forward with me to the completion of the new financial management and audit regime for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I briefly come back to some comments of the honourable member for Forrest in relation to the National Media Liaison Service, better known as aNiMaLS, which he referred to earlier with regard to how such agencies fit into the picture and how they will be affected by the new acts. I draw the attention of the House to the quite comprehensive Joint Committee of Public Accounts report No. 331, which looked at that question to ensure that all government agencies and departments were covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the areas that I think the honourable member for Forrest would have been reflecting on before was a view of the report on the FMA bill, the Financial Management and Accountability Bill. That particular bill establishes a basic accountability framework, and the detail of how that works is to be left to the finance minister's orders and regulations. When commenting on this in the report, the committee said that it accepted that the FMA bill was providing only a framework and that the detailed arrangements, which would change over time and differ from circumstance to circumstance, were appropriately dealt with in subsidiary legislation. That is pretty important because one can imagine what it would mean if every department and agency had to be included in the FMA or the appropriate bill at the time: we would have amendment after amendment as agencies were taken on board and wound down. So they would need to come under the regulations and one would expect them to be subject to disallowances as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note these matters with regard to an organisation such as aNiMaLS because I expect that it and similar bodies will come under the new act. The committee did look at that question, and that is why we have come to support the government view that the FMA bill established the basic accountability framework and that these other matters would be subject to regulations. The committee unanimously supported the view that was expressed in the report so I do not see a great difficulty. In fact, what has been suggested by others would be almost impractical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in the bill before us are important when it comes to accountability. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts was very pleased to have had the opportunity to make a substantial contribution to ensuring that this legislation is the best that could be developed in the consultation between the government and the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the Minister for Finance, his officers and department for their cooperation and assistance to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in producing its report. I also commend the minister for the manner in which he has accepted a lot of the amendments that we have put forward. They were put forward in a very genuine way to ensure that we did have&mdash;and we do have&mdash;the best possible legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee will continue to monitor the amendments as they go through this House and the Senate, and we look forward to the other amendments that will come before the House in due course.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1994 is a bill in a process of reform. It is one the government appears anxious about because the government is concerned that there should be an open attitude, transparency and accountability in the process. Of course, this government has really weakened the whole process of audit examination since it came to office, and the status of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has diminished in the parliament. That was a conscious decision of the government, and the current Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) was heavily involved in that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember when that Public Accounts Committee, under the Fraser government, was the pre-eminent committee of the parliament. That is now no longer the case, because the government runs from scrutiny, it dislikes scrutiny and, if it does not like the rules under which scrutiny is conducted, it changes the rules. There are a number of instances that I will bring out as examples to the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott). I hope that his wish that aNiMaLS will be part of the process of audit comes true. But it is not the minister making that statement; it is somebody who chairs for the Labor Party one of the great parliamentary committees. That committee, with a lot of encouragement from the coalition members, has successfully brought about some changes to legislation that the minister first of all proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Making a name in this parliament is not about being compliant with government&mdash;I would like to impress that on members of the Labor Party first of all. The member for Banks (Mr Melham), a colleague of the member for Oxley, is the Chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. He has damaged his prospects within the Labor Party by being a good parliamentarian. As chairman of that committee, he has stood up for issues, great issues of principle, because he believed in what he was doing. I think that ultimately he will succeed in this place because of his commitment to principle. </PARA>

This is not the sort of attitude that I would expect to see in members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts because they must bring that accountability to the parliament. They must report fairly and honestly and they must bring ministers to book&mdash;they must do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman of that committee must be not just a compliant participant in changes to the act; he must be an advocate for changes to the act in such a way that the government must listen to him.

That should never occur. They are the only protection for the people. It is an abuse of power that we see, creating the impression that premiers and prime ministers do not brook any restrictions on their actions. They must accept them. I remember the days, for instance, when the Australian National Audit Office signed that notorious, infamous lease for Centenary House. John Taylor was in the invidious position of accepting that lease. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are problems in organisations. What will the government decide about the sale of Qantas where there is an interesting mix of the private and the public? What will the government do about the sale of Telecom? Who is going to do the audit process there? These are important decisions but Mr Taylor, back in 1992, said, `Listen, the government should not try to escape the audit process.' And some slapdash approach by an external auditor, unfamiliar with the public accountability process, is just not good enough. I want to pay tribute to Mr Taylor for his work as Auditor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The independence of the Auditor-General has been raised on many occasions and over the last four or five years it has been raised more frequently than I can ever remember it being raised before. Again, I want to pay tribute to Mr Taylor and the fearless way in which he has raised that issue. Going back as far as 1989, he has been active in presenting the need for independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been instances where the Auditor-General has been to the fore in raising important issues. One was on the jobtrain scheme run by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Another was income and assets testing of age pensions by the Department of Social Security. There was also the nursing homes payments scheme and the administration of the Medicare benefits scheme, both schemes run by the Department of Community Services and Health. These were massive issues where there is a need for strict accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should draw to the attention of the House the fact that without the actions and activity of the Auditor-General the Public Accounts Committee would probably be whistling in the wind most days because it would not have any work to do. One of the great tasks of the Public Accounts Committee is to pick up the reports of the Auditor-General and pursue in detail what has occurred. On behalf of the parliament it has to find out what lies behind the bald statements and discover inefficiencies or the inappropriate use of government funds as judged by government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General, in his reports to the parliament, has in the past raised very significant issues such as jobtrain and the others that I have mentioned. Mr Taylor, in his 35th report, considered the government's measures for the wool industry. He protested at the government having gone back on December 1990 decisions. He said that in most circumstances audit of a Commonwealth owned and controlled body should be conducted by the Auditor-General. That is most proper and appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am trying to say is that, with the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport and the changes to the Public Accounts Committee procedures to diminish its significance in the parliament, we see the character of a government willing to change things if they are not to its liking. The behaviour of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in regard to the piggery involved a process of secrecy and a veil drawn across what should be transparent behaviour for the Prime Minister of Australia. I have never known of any other Prime Minister who has actively pursued business whilst holding the great office of Prime Minister. To enter into agreements and pursue a business career whilst carrying the mantle of Prime Minister imposes great advantages on that individual in negotiations both with foreign companies and with Australian firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has never been questioned. It is not a matter for the Auditor-General; it is a matter for this government and for the man who leads it, who prefer to avoid the direct accountability and scrutiny that governments generally have to live with but benefit by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not only the piggery process. At Sydney airport we have the instrument landing things not working. We have the Minister for Transport changing the safety processes willy-nilly. A report on what has been the measurement of sound distress for residents of that area has been presented to the minister and he says that it is wrong. He just says, `I haven't looked at the report but I know it's wrong.' That is the way in which decisions are made by the government. Therefore, the only protection for the parliament is to have an Auditor-General as a servant of the parliament and have him supported by strong parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to look at the current logging situation, the dispute that surrounds this parliament, to see that the government has made a commitment but now wants to, for political reasons, change its mind. When things get politically difficult we have a government that will not stand for principle. The resistance that Mr Taylor found at times during his period of office was predictable given the fact that the government seems to reject harsh findings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got this queer situation whereby the National Media Liaison Service, the propaganda machine of the government, does not come under scrutiny. That is not surprising. The service spends over $1 million a year for a bunch of journalists to scrutinise the media and listen to everything the opposition says. They are being paid by the taxpayer. They are sitting around Australia and in Parliament House monitoring every word that is being said, looking at every newspaper, cutting things out, and designing publicity programs and information for the Prime Minister and members of the government. It is a propaganda machine that anybody during the Second World War would have been proud of. Anybody would be proud of the technology that they have and of their capacity to intervene in the affairs of Australia. Also, the disinformation supplied by them to the press gallery in this place is well known by everybody who works here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the group that is not going to be scrutinised. If the government does not want something exposed to scrutiny, it ensures that it is not scrutinised. If it does not like a report, the report is wrong. The Prime Minister was not really in that piggery at all; it was his friend John Brown and he is out of that now. If it does not like the rules, it changes them. If it does not like something, it denies it. John Taylor and the audit process are one of the few protections that this parliament has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly condemn the government for its failure to enter into a proper audit process. It is critical for this parliament that the government bend immediately to the wishes of the parliament, the chairman of that committee and the Auditor-General so that all of the government's activities are transparent and plain to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spendthrift attitude that the government has adopted over all its years in office with taxpayers' funds makes it crucial that people running small businesses and trying to keep families together know exactly what the government is doing with every dollar that it rips out of the pockets of the Australian people. The government must be accountable in every program for every dollar that it spends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek to have the views of the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee prevail over the government and bring all areas under appropriate scrutiny.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1994. This bill provides for the transition from the Audit Act 1901 to the regime contained in the Auditor-General and financial management package of bills recently passed by this House and currently before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does a number of things. It provides for the formal transfer of balances from the Audit Act's existing accounting structure to the new structure proposed by the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994. It also provides for the continuation of the existing position of Independent Auditor as the auditor of the Australian National Audit Office. The bill provides for the continuation of existing safeguards for the auditing of security and intelligence agencies and for the continuation of an assortment of other contractual and other arrangements entered into under the authority of the Audit Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me principally, and what concerns many others on this side of the House, is what this bill fails to do. It, and the package of bills it is following, fail to enshrine a principle that has emerged from the many reports into the role of auditors-general in this country. It is a principle that is crucial to the proper working of the Australian government and the governments of the states and territories. This principle, in short, is that government organisations and officials must be accountable to parliament. It is only by being accountable to parliament that they are accountable to the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two reports to which I will refer are <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: Ally of the people and parliament</EMPHASIS>, produced by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in March 1989, and the report of the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters, produced in Western Australia in 1992. The first report argues that a strong Australian audit office is essential for the maintenance of the accountability of federal government organisations and officials to parliament. The report addresses the question of what should be the limits of the Auditor-General's responsibilities and for which federal government organisations it should be the external auditor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report has come to be known as the report of the royal commission into WA Inc. For those who may not know, WA Inc. is the expression used to describe a particularly dark period in the history of so-called responsible government in the 1980s in Western Australia. WA Inc. was the disastrous period presided over by the successive Labor governments of Brian Burke, Peter Dowding and the present Minister for Human Services and Health, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). It is a period of government for which the citizens of Western Australia are still paying dearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no apology for referring in my comments to the report of the findings of the royal commission into WA Inc. because the sorts of comments made are apt to foreshadow what could easily happen in the federal scene, if it is not already happening, if appropriate steps are not taken. That report made many valuable recommendations about the role that could be played by an effective and independent Auditor-General in preventing the events of the WA Inc. period from being repeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Westminster system of government, the Auditor-General's position is considered the crucial link in the process of accountability to the taxpayer on the utilisation of funding. Auditors-general, both federal and state, are appointed under federal and state legislation respectively and report their findings directly to parliament. They do this by issuing objective reports on their audits to the parliaments as the people's representative. The reports assist parliament to operate on an informed and effective basis and are considered an essential element in the operation of democratic government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given this essential role, it is vital that auditors-general not only be independent but also that they be seen to be independent. This means that the Auditor-General should be an officer of the parliament, accountable to parliament and not to the government of the day. This was in fact a key recommendation of the 1989 report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and one that has significantly been ignored by this government in its package of Auditor-General and financial management legislation. I add, by way of comment on the 1989 report, that there was a majority of Labor members on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which made the recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has made attempts to implement the recommendation. Senator Watson introduced a private member's bill, the Audit (Auditor-General an Officer of the Parliament) Amendment Bill 1993, into the Senate. In his second reading speech on 6 October 1993, Senator Watson referred to the findings of the 1989 report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. He said that to make the Auditor-General an officer of the parliament, independent of the government, is a necessary step to achieving a proper relationship between the Auditor-General and the parliament. Senator Watson's bill passed all stages in the Senate but, due to opposition from the government, has now been removed from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has further ignored the cardinal principle of accountability by its secrecy and obstruction in various matters. The most recent to come to attention was the outgoing Auditor-General's attempt to audit the operations of the National Media Liaison Service, a body which last year received an appropriation of $1.5 million of taxpayers' funds. In the report of the royal commission into WA Inc., in a chapter headed `Accountability', recommendation 9 is that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All public sector bodies, programmes and activities involving any use of public resources be the subject of audit by the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the member for Fremantle, the Minister for Human Services and Health, should draw the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to this report. She at least should be familiar with its contents. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The office of the Auditor-General provides a critical link in the accountability chain between the public sector, and the Parliament and the community. It alone subjects the practical conduct and operations of the public sector as a whole to regular, independent investigation and review. This function must be fully guaranteed and its discharge facilitated. The Auditor-General is the Parliament's principal informant on the performance of the administrative system. The Parliament therefore has a special responsibility to ensure both that the independence and the effective resourcing of the Auditor-General are secured, and that its own investigative procedures (particularly through committees) are such that it fully utilises the information about government supplied to it in the Auditor-General's reports.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor-General is no mere scrutineer of the financial affairs of the departments and agencies of government, notwithstanding the importance of this responsibility. The Auditor-General's role must now be accepted as multi-purposed . . . In auditing the accounts of an agency, the Auditor-General is expected to address not merely the financial integrity of the agency's activities but also such matters as the agency's compliance with the law and the legislation and directions under which it acts and the controls it has to secure that compliance; the probity of official conduct in its financial affairs; the appropriateness of performance indicators; and . . . the adequacy of the records on which its management is based and carried into effect. As well, the Auditor-General has an expanding and more far reaching responsibility, one which relates directly to protecting the public purse.</PARA>
<PARA>This all applies directly to the Commonwealth Auditor-General's attempts to conduct an audit of aNiMaLS, attempts which to date have been thwarted by the objections of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Media Liaison Service: A loophole in accountability?</EMPHASIS> was tabled in this House yesterday or the day before. In that report, the Auditor-General documents the refusal of aNiMaLS to enter into any discussions with the Australian National Audit Office. The National Media Liaison Service referred the Auditor-General to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), who provided the Auditor-General with legal opinions to the effect that aNiMaLS is not able to be subjected to an audit under the Audit Act. The Auditor-General concluded in his report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Media Liaison Service is therefore not subject to the normal accountability mechanisms in place over government programs. As a consequence, although National Media Liaison Service is fully funded by the taxpayer and its stated roles and functions are predominantly administrative in nature, its operations are not subject to the scrutiny normally associated with the expenditure of public monies . . . The accountability arrangements for all activities that involve the use of taxpayers' funds should be enshrined as a central tenet of the provisions of any new Auditor-General Act.</PARA>
<PARA>I urge the government to adopt the Auditor-General's recommendations and make itself properly accountable to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an incidental matter, the legal opinion and a subsequent clarification of it referred to by the Auditor-General in the report have not been made public. I have attempted to obtain copies from the Auditor-General and the Attorney-General's Department but neither felt able to provide it. I call upon the government&mdash;in particular, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Administrative Services&mdash;to ensure that the advice and the clarification referred to are tabled in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the royal commission into WA Inc. continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Put colloquially, the Auditor-General has the proper and developing function of conducting "value for money" audits of government programmes and agencies. These responsibilities are of great importance. Their discharge must be facilitated in every way. They constitute a vital check on waste, mismanagement and the subversion of government's policies and programmes. The above description is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of the Auditor-General's function. It serves merely to illustrate why the Commission&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the royal commission&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">attributes to it the importance it does and why it considers the office itself to be one that must be safeguarded and enhanced. Although in the end only a reporting agency to Parliament, it can properly be described as the public's first check and best window on the conduct of government. No activity of government fails to involve some use or commitment of public resources. No activity of government can, in consequence, be allowed to be removed from the Auditor-General's scrutiny . . . What we wish to emphasise is that for so long as an agency owns, or uses, or risks, public property in its operations, there can be no acceptable reason for its not being subjected to the full scrutiny of the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA>This lesson having been learnt from the best teacher, experience, it is to be hoped that the Minister for Human Services and Health, being familiar with the report, will encourage the Minister for Administrative Services, under whose auspices aNiMaLS operates, to open that agency to the full scrutiny of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the royal commission into WA Inc. recognised the vulnerability of the Auditor-General to undesirable pressure from the government. In its report the commission said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is every prospect that an effective Auditor-General is likely to incur, at least periodically, the hostility of a government and/or of government departments and agencies. It is imperative that, while the Auditor-General be accountable for his or her actions&mdash;and the Parliament is the appropriate agency to exact this&mdash;the executive arm of government be denied the practical capacity to impair the full and effective discharge of the responsibilities of the office.</PARA>
<PARA>The retiring federal Auditor-General, Mr John Taylor, referred to this same hostility in an interview with Pru Goward on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daybreak</EMPHASIS> program on Radio National on 25 January 1995. He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we've listed the highlights, if you like, of your battles with the Government over the immediate past, but of course, there have been many. What do you think they all come down to?</PARA>
<PARA>John Taylor's response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oh, I think an inability of governments to really want to be told what's actually happening, rather than what they want to be seen as happening.</PARA>
<PARA>Pru Goward went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . would you say that there's been a particular problem in dealing with this Government?</PARA>
<PARA>His immediate answer was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think so, yes.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to refer to the 1989 report of the Joint Public Accounts Committee. He indicated that his two predecessors both retired with angry last reports and concern over the independence and funding of the office, and he said that it has been going on for quite a while. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think there are great concerns for the future because the independence of the Public Service is certainly under some threat, I believe, certainly at senior levels. I mean, Tony Cole left rather quickly, didn't he, and I mean, he's a man of great integrity and a great intellect. Mike Codd went pretty quickly, too.</PARA>
<PARA>Pru Goward asked him the relatively direct but rather obvious question: `Did you come under political pressure?' His response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oh, of course. The parliament itself is saying they need help through us. We need help to do it properly and we're not being given that help.</PARA>
<PARA>He referred to some history and in a reference, I think, to the package of bills that is presently before parliament, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've now got to the stage&mdash;at long last&mdash;where the parliament has got an opportunity to decide, finally, what it wants&mdash;not what I want.</PARA>
<PARA>The government, in this House, has plainly decided that it wants a continuation of what has gone on before, which no doubt will result in John Taylor's successor being able to give an interview to radio in due course saying that he, too, came under political pressure and that he, too, has great concerns for the future because the independence of the Public Service is under threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to aNiMaLS, yesterday in question time I asked the Minister for Finance what possible justification there could be for the government to protect aNiMaLS from the usual scrutiny associated with accountability for the expenditure of public moneys, that is, audit by the Auditor-General. In his response, the minister correctly pointed out that the agency is subject to financial audit, but is not subject to an efficiency audit. He then sought to justify why aNiMaLS is not subject to an efficiency audit. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its position is similar to that shared by members of ministerial staffs, members of opposition staffs and members of parliamentary staffs. They are certainly not currently subject to efficiency audit, although a financial audit applies to all they do. If you want to think logically through that and decide whether it is useful to have the Auditor-General run an efficiency audit over the Leader of the Opposition's staff or over your own staff, for example, perhaps you could write me a note and let me know.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me take the opportunity to respond here. The minister calls in aid logic. What he seems to be confusing is an agency&mdash;a government agency, operating on taxpayers' money, providing a service to government, ostensibly&mdash;with the offices of members of parliament, whether they are ministers, leaders of opposition or otherwise, and the staff associated with them. It is a fundamental principle of democratic government that members of parliament are able to operate in their deliberations independently of pressure from the executive government. If an efficiency audit were to be conducted on members of parliament and the results published, that would have an undoubted effect on the independence of members of parliament&mdash;whether they are ministers, leaders of opposition, or government or opposition backbenchers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has not provided any justification whatever. I suggest that the real justification is that an efficiency audit on aNiMaLS would expose that taxpayers' money is being used for a partisan political purpose, and that is what the government seeks to avoid disclosing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)acknowledges the Beatification by His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, of Mother Mary MacKillop, founder of Australia's first religious order, the Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)recognises the contribution to the people and society of Australia by Blessed Mary MacKillop and the beneficent and enduring work of the Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph.</PARA>
<PARA>The recent beatification of Mother Mary MacKillop by His Holiness the Pope bestowed a great honour on a great Australian. Mary MacKillop's aid for the poor, particularly the rural poor, and her creation of the order of the Sisters of St Joseph to spread and maintain her vision and work are now, of course, part of the Australian legend. I hope that hereafter they will form a much larger part. I say this in the first place because the qualities of charity, sacrifice, courage and perseverance are qualities for a nation to live by and ideals to encourage in future generations of Australians. We would all hope to see them inform the lives of Australians, including the lives of governments, those whose privilege and responsibility it is to make policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mary MacKillop's sympathies were with the underdogs of society, the people on the margins. That is where, traditionally, Australian sympathies have lain. We should never lose those sympathies or lose sight of them. We should be guided by them. They are as relevant now as they were a century ago. That seems to me to be the great contemporary lesson of Mary MacKillop: to look after those on the margins, to care for them, to bring them in and to give them hope. I hope Mary MacKillop becomes a prominent figure in our history and our consciousness for another reason also; that is, because she was a woman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said on the arrival of the Pope in Australia, while women pioneered this country as much as men, the contribution of women has not always been adequately acknowledged. Women brought their labour, courage and moral strength to the frontier of Australia, which in earlier times needed some moral strength. They continue to bring it to the modern Australian community. They have been defining forces in our economic and social development and our national character. That is why I say that, in honouring Mary MacKillop, His Holiness has honoured all Australian women and, I believe, he is honouring us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In moving this motion today I want to stress the broad appeal and significance of Mary MacKillop. In a sectarian age she was avowedly non-sectarian. She drew support from Catholics and non-Catholics alike. Protestants and Jews were her friends and supporters. Years before the federation of the nation her view was national. She thought as an Australian, in Australian terms. Born into a Gaelic speaking Scottish family, she spoke as an Australian and she began a letter to the Vatican&mdash;one has to remember it was a century ago&mdash;with the words, `It is an Australian who speaks.' A century ago, though most people would refer to themselves as Australians, the notion of writing as an Australian would have been somewhat unusual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust honourable members will understand what I mean when I say that the beatification of Mother Mary MacKillop rings with significance for all Australians. The qualities she embodied&mdash;openness and tolerance, courage, persistence, faith and care for others&mdash;are qualities for individuals, communities and nations to live by. The Josephites continue to practice those virtues in their work for the poor in Australia and New Zealand, and increasingly in countries of the Third World. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all honourable members will agree that we will serve Australia well, and future generations of Australians well, if we allow the values which inspired and guided Mary MacKillop's work to inspire and guide our own. There is nothing to be gained from pretending that religious faith and the place of the church in our communities have not declined since Mary MacKillop's day, yet the message of her life easily translates to our much more sceptical and secular society. It would, I think, bring a blessing on Australia, on future generations, if as a result of the beatification of Mary MacKillop that message spread. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Societies always need faith. They certainly need hope and charity. They are the things which Mary MacKillop had in abundance. Our children will always need a spiritual dimension to their lives, a point His Holiness made very poignantly during his visit to Australia, one I am sure everyone in this House endorses. I happen to think that in the traditions of this country and the quality of our people and institutions there is fertile ground for ideals to flourish. I think people are looking for guidance and a spiritual dimension to their lives. The lessons which we take from that great strength that Mary MacKillop had is something I am sure the country can emulate into the future. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy, on behalf of the opposition, to warmly welcome and second the motion that has been moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I find myself in total agreement with all that he has said about the importance of this event for Australia, particularly for Australian women. Most important is the honour that the Pope has bestowed on the entire Australian community through the beatification of Mary MacKillop a short time ago. Mary MacKillop demonstrated in her life the simple Christian virtues of commitment, service, humility and great courage in a far more difficult and far more intolerant age.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit of His Holiness the Pope did honour not only to Australian Catholics but to Australians of all faiths and, indeed, Australians of no faith at all. That remarkable man demonstrated by his visit and the way in which he performed during the time that he was here&mdash;brief though it was&mdash;what an incredibly strong man, in every sense of the word, he has proved himself to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mary MacKillop's example, not only to people of the Catholic faith but to Australian women and Australians generally, is one that we are all humbled by. I very much agree with the Prime Minister when he says that, even in this more sceptical and cynical age, it is important that people draw on such reservoirs of faith that they might have, and it is important to remind particularly the young in our community of the importance of spiritual values and of things of the spirit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister said, Mary MacKillop spoke as an Australian at a time when that language was not quite so readily used. She demonstrated by her own life and service those egalitarian values that all of us as Australians hold very dear. It is to me as a non-Catholic but as a member of the Protestant section of the Australian community very humbling and important that the head of the Catholic Church has seen fit to honour this very distinguished Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share the obvious enthusiasm of many in the Catholic community in Australia for this event that occurred in the sight of so many thousands of Australians of all ages and from all parts of Australia who travelled, often in difficult circumstances, to the special mass at Randwick racecourse. That was a reminder to even the most profoundly cynical and sceptical in the Australian community that there is a very strong and deep Christian streak within our ranks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this motion on the beatification of Mother Mary MacKillop. I say at the outset that the importance and solemnity of the beatification last month and of the motion before the House of Representatives moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), is in no way lessened by referring to the extent to which Mary MacKillop has arrived in the psyche of all Australians and a particular grouping of Australians when at the most recent cricket test at the Adelaide oval a banner was unfurled which said `Gatting's 100, Mary MacKillop's 2nd miracle'. That was a deserving accolade in all the circumstances. It was worthy to the extent to which the message of Mary MacKillop has penetrated. But, to be fair and to be more accurate, if she was really involved in that exercise, she would have been on the side of the Aussies, not on the side of the English.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mary MacKillop was a pioneer of her time&mdash;not necessarily the pioneering we associate with explorers and those intrepid men and women that opened the way for the settlement of Australia. Hers was, rather, a contribution that was spiritual through improving the minds of country people, through her determination to see the education of children carried through and through the provision of opportunity to so many people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mary MacKillop placed the dignity of humankind above wealth and ambition. As such, she was dedicated to all Australians, not just those of the Catholic faith. It is interesting that in her life she reached out to so many people. When she was turned out of the convent in Adelaide during the crisis of her excommunication, it was with the Jewish businessman Emmanuel Solomon that she found refuge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She maintained a long friendship with the Barr-Smith family, philanthropists from Adelaide. She had special links with the Presbyterian Church, and I understand one of my colleagues will cover that in more detail later. She was an Australian of great importance to people other than just Catholics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend her understanding of the Australian community which was shaped by her own life, a life that saw her father frequently unemployed. Her large family was constantly on the move in search of work and had very little money for food and clothing&mdash;conditions, in some places, reminiscent of today. Equally, having spent much of her life in rural Australia, Mary MacKillop was no stranger to the uncertainties facing farming communities and families being forced off their land by horrific droughts, floods and tough economic times&mdash;again, experiences that sadly are still valid today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I salute the Sisters of St Joseph and their founder, Blessed Mary MacKillop. In the same way, I salute the Reverend John Flynn, the famous `Flynn of the Inland', and all religious leaders who over the years have helped Australia and the wellbeing of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the presence in the gallery today of a wide cross-section of the community to listen to this motion, and perhaps to listen to question time later on. I am sure they will be peaceful. I hope they will be peaceful. I would never urge otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wholeheartedly support this motion. I was very moved and privileged to have been at Mascot airport to welcome His Holiness Pope John Paul II and also to have attended, with a very large crowd, the beatification mass at Randwick. I wish the Sisters of St Joseph every onward success. They are deserving of their place in the sun, especially that which has emerged with the beatification of a wonderful Australian, Mary MacKillop. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of pride and honour that I too rise to speak in support of the motion before the House on the beatification of the Blessed Mary MacKillop. If any person could serve as a role model for us all it is Mary MacKillop, a truly remarkable woman&mdash;and previous speakers and our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have acknowledged that. Her road to sainthood has been marked with setbacks and paved with obstructions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we tend to glorify our famous artists, sports people and television soap stars. Sometimes we overlook the quiet achievers, the hard sloggers, like Mary MacKillop. But the beatification of Mary is a defining moment for Australian culture. She deserves to take her place on the honour board with our greatest Australians. Whether Catholic or not, we should all be proud of this remarkable woman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mary's beatification gives us hope. It vindicates the stand she took; that is, the stand for what is right. Her challenge to civil and religious authority, her defence of the poor and the underdog, her belief that she had to help alleviate suffering and her vision for a more compassionate society would give hope to those who struggle and suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her beatification comes at a time when Australian history is reclaiming the lost voices of women. But her achievements took place in a society in which granting such a privilege to an Australian woman who was not yet 30 was never done. In that sense, Mary MacKillop stands as a model for Australian women. Australian born of Scottish parents, Mary grew up in the gold rush era. She had first-hand knowledge of poverty and hardships endured by the families of miners and other working-class settlers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with Father Julian Woods, Mary established a system of schools, hospitals and welfare centres crossing state lines. She refused to be put down by men wanting to control her work. Mary commenced teaching in an abandoned stable at Penola in South Australia. It is not difficult, even today, for us to glean that hardship featured in her life from the very outset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She experienced discrimination in Bathurst and Brisbane. She was accused by bishops of being young, sentimental, colonial, born in Australia, of non-Irish stock, female&mdash;shame!&mdash;the daughter of a bankrupt colonial seminarian, a former excommunicate and a strong personality. She was accused of being obstinate and ambitious. Although a supporter, the one-time Bishop of Sydney, Patrick Moran, insisted that she stand down as the head of her order in 1885 and prevented her from resuming her position for more than a decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1885 the Australasian hierarchy voted 14:3 that the Josephites be subjected to diocesan control, but the Vatican, under Pope Leo XIII overruled the Australian hierarchy, so MacKillop won in spite of opposition from most Australian bishops. Really, that was some feat. But she has left a legacy that will endure as an educator who created a structure which was in its heyday educating more than 100,000 boys and girls a year, from a time when their grandparents had no education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mary MacKillop epitomises courage and conviction and, most importantly, a sense of justice. As our Prime Minister stated not only in the motion today before the House but particularly in his farewell speech to His Holiness Pope John Paul II on 20 January this year&mdash;and if the Prime Minister does not mind, I would like to take two lines out of that speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In honouring this great Australian woman&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he was referring to His Holiness&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">you have honoured all Australian women and all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>Regardless of one's race, colour or creed, every person in this country could not help but relate to that particular statement. Reading through biographical details about Blessed Mary MacKillop, one is immediately struck by the awesome difficulties she faced and the responsibilities that she carried on her shoulders at such a young age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thoughts of Mary evoke words such as courageous, resilient, practical, spiritual, enduring, but most definitely compassionate. Today there are nearly 2,000 sisters of St Joseph in almost every diocese in Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, Peru and Ireland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a very harsh, male dominated society of that time and particularly a different culture from what we experience today, Mary established through her church a need that she thought was there, and she wanted to be part of, to overcome poverty. I think we could all learn today from her courage. Poverty was very real for Mary MacKillop. She and the nuns in the order could identify with the poor. Yet she set out to educate the children of those poor families, gratis if necessary, without any financial assistance from governments or outside sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end they decided that all Josephites should live among the poor whom they served. They had no houses, land or money in their own right and they subsisted solely on school fees and the gratuitous offerings of local people. I am pleased that it is the federal government of today that has recognised the importance of independent and innovative curriculums such as the one in the Mary MacKillop College in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An allocation of $2 1/2 million has contributed enormously to the building of that college. We have had in my electorate for over 60 years a centre of excellence of education run by the Sisters of St Joseph, but it took that grant coming forward to enable them to build a college which is now called the Mary MacKillop College. It educates girls from year 7 to year 12, and some 900 girls from some 40 ethnic nationalities attend that college. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That school of excellence came about because of the determination, because of assistance from our government, but particularly because of the assistance and support of the parishioners and the parents, and they need to be congratulated for it. I am proud that the dream of Mary MacKillop continues this day not only in my electorate but also throughout Australia. In co-founding that excellent order of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, and indeed overcoming all of the obstructions that she faced in a community of that time, despite her good works and intentions she always had an abundance of detractors which, I think, at times inspires many females today to fight on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among her supporters, as has already been indicated, were  many people who were not of her faith, but they saw that she was an enduring, compassionate woman who wanted, with that need of justice, to carry on those works. She was able, at all times, to achieve because she was tolerant and she did have compassion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In establishing 160 Josephite houses and 117 schools attended by more than 12,000 children, Mary's record is second to none. She fought for autonomy for the Josephites. Her followers in the order became known as the Brown Josephites. They are quite different today to what we had when I was educated as a very young girl, but I do not think that today I would be doing with my life what I am doing without the influence that they had on me at a very young age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mary MacKillop was well before her time in insisting on the importance of a national structure in disparate Australia. Without question, this assisted her aim of educating large sections not only of the Catholic poor but of all who sought her aid. In all places that were marked with bitter disputes with one or more bishops, she always overcame those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I commend the motion. I thank the movers of the motion for the support that they have given to this wonderful woman. I am sure that she will continue to be a person we look up to for the rest of our lives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only as a member of the House of Representatives of the national parliament but also as a Catholic and as one who was educated by the Josephite sisters, it is certainly a great honour to be able to commend and support this motion before the House this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with much pleasure that I rise today to commend the beatification of Mother Mary MacKillop, now to be known as the Blessed Mary of the Cross. The beatification of Mother Mary MacKillop comes at a time when the pace of modern society seems hell-bent on swamping the ideals and values of Christian life in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was therefore heart-warming to witness the widespread community support for the recent papal tour, along with the subsequent beatification of Mother Mary MacKillop. The interest that was shown in these events confirms the importance of faith within the Australian community, and this should not be forgotten to us in this place when making decisions on behalf of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe Mary MacKillop's greatest contribution to Australia has been the development of the teaching order of the Josephite sisters whose talents and skills now exist far beyond Australian shores. If it can ever be said that a person is born with a gift, teaching was the gift bestowed on Mary MacKillop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her parents, who were migrants from Scotland, instilled in their eldest daughter the importance of an education. She was thankfully given opportunities to develop her intellectual skill&mdash;and I say thankfully because gender stereotypes at the time often neglected the intellectual abilities of many potentially brilliant women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her first teaching job came as a governess to her aunt's children, who lived in a small country town called Penola in South Australia. It was here that she met Father Julian Woods, who inspired Mary MacKillop's passion for reaching the educational needs of outback children. It was with Father Woods that Mary MacKillop began the Josephite order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1867, Mary MacKillop took her religious vows in a response to what she knew was a clear call from God to carry out a mission of educating the poor of Australia. Mother Mary's mission never included emancipating the poor from poverty and she never believed that poverty could be eliminated through economic management. She did not believe this was possible. Rather, Mother Mary believed poverty would always exist and that for the sisters of St Joseph to serve the poor properly they must live the same reality. This commitment to radical poverty became the basis of the Josephite order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mary MacKillop's achievements are more striking given the circumstances surrounding her role within the church of the time. As a somewhat independent woman in an age of men, she was often treated cruelly and harshly by her male hierarchs. For example, five years after starting the Josephite order she was excommunicated by the Bishop of Adelaide for insubordination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, a later Bishop of Adelaide believed the many malicious rumours circulating about her and tried to have a kangaroo court dismiss her once again. Yet despite these setbacks she continued to champion the cause of the poor, and it is this point that makes her a heroine to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These harsh times also say something for the strength of the Josephite sisters who never wavered from their belief in Mother Mary. Indeed, it was during her excommunication that the Josephite order strengthened in its resolve. Mary MacKillop is seen more than just an educator of the poor, the deprived and the underprivileged. She is seen as a visionary who stressed the Australian foundations of her faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against the wishes of the bishops, who wanted her enterprise to be regionally based and influenced, she emphasised the necessity for an Australia-wide vision. She looked for an educational institution which could reach across physical and racial boundaries. Indeed, long before a federation of Australia was even thought of, she was thinking of a body which, in its mobility and homogeneity, would cover the whole continent, including New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One important example of this vision is the Mary MacKillop College in Port Macquarie. The previous speaker, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), talked about the Mary MacKillop College in her electorate, and there is also one in my electorate in Port Macquarie on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. It is considered one of the finest educational institutions in the region. The legacy of the 19th century Josephites continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From hearing the fascinating history of Mary MacKillop, I am encouraged by her remarkable ability to extend friendship and kindness to those of different religious traditions. Her love and affection to all humans, regardless of faith or racial background, was reciprocated by non-Catholics who supported and encouraged her, particularly when members of her own church persecuted or rejected her. Throughout Mary MacKillop's life she befriended and was befriended by the entire spectrum of humankind, most being drawn to Mother Mary by her fierce determination. An important example of this is the marble slab over her tomb, which was paid for by Scottish Presbyterians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the eyes of many Australians, therefore, Mary MacKillop is a shining example of what life is all about. Her whole life was a miracle of determination and devotion to a set of principles which she never wavered from despite enormous challenges to this self-belief. Mary MacKillop shows to us all today that the human spirit is alive in us all and it is up to each of us to hold on to what we believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mary MacKillop was, in many ways, a pioneer of the Australian character. She was an underdog, often the ultimate  underdog, and as such can be considered one of the ultimate Australians. Her essence as an Australian drew love and affection from the Australian people. She set an example for Australians regardless of race or religious beliefs. She is indeed the epitome of everything Australia stands for. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that she was poor, but she saw her vision and her purpose in life as bringing education to the poor and&mdash;something which is often overlooked&mdash;having her order care for women who were abandoned by men who went droving or to the gold rush for months at a time. Her understanding of the Australian society in which she moved and in which she was born gave her a basis on which to pursue her faith in a particularly Australian way. Despite the fact that the establishment of the order and the way in which the bishops at the time attacked her, she continued to pursue her vision and her goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us have heard that Mary was not to be controlled. As well as that, she was to create an order which had a woman as its superior&mdash;not a male bishop, as was the norm at the time. In doing so, she challenged not only the people around her but also the hierarchy of the church at a time when the church and the church's control was seen as an integral part of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We respect Blessed Mary for her tenacity and her belief in what was right. More importantly, we respect her for the kind of loyalty that we see exhibited in the sisters after she was excommunicated. It is that bond that makes Josephites special. That makes Mary MacKillop special and it is her legacy to us. At that time the sisters turned to each other and turned to Blessed Mary for support and to reassess and redetermine what they were doing. They knew that what they were doing was right. Whilst parish priests might have railed at them from pulpits and called them ignorant servant girls, in their hearts they kept alive their sense of purpose, their sense of vision and their sense of Christian commitment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was a woman who, though she had education, sought to expand that system of education and bring it to the poor. We recognise that.

In providing Australians with an education, she has created an opportunity for people to be part of the mainstream of Australian society and to be able to participate fully in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also see her as an Australian who did not recognise state boundaries. She was an Australian first and foremost.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But underlining this, and underlying the things that make her a saint, is her charity; her charity in the very real sense of the word; her love of her church and her love for her fellow human beings.

If we Australians see nothing else in Mary MacKillop, and if we learn nothing else, we must learn about her charity and her care for the disadvantaged and women who have been abandoned in a society where excitement, distance and isolation are the norm. Her beatification is important for all of us. However, it is only important if we take up her challenge, her sense of vision and her sense of purpose to create a just Australian society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, am delighted to speak on this motion. Blessed Mary of the Cross, or Mother Mary MacKillop as she is better known to most Australians, has a lot to answer for. If it were not for the teachings of her sisters at a tiny school called Nangwarry in South Australia, I have absolutely no doubt that I would not be standing in this place today, because my education after primary school went completely downhill at the hands of the Marist brothers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to tell the House a little bit about that school. It was just down the road towards Mount Gambier from the town of Penola, where Mary set up her first school. Our school was built by voluntary labour by the workers of the town of Nangwarry. To describe the town to you: it was set up after the war as a milling town, and the population consisted almost entirely of immigrants from Europe. A lot of the people there were impoverished refugees from the Second World War who went there in the late 1940s and in the 1950s. They came from many different countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a total of 87 children at the school when I attended, and virtually the only English speakers were the Cameron kids. There were 10 of us all told&mdash;a good Catholic family&mdash;but not all of us were attending the school at that time. The rest of the children at the school were made up of those migrant families and refugee families and, of course, there were many different languages. In fact, 17 different languages were spoken at the school. And not one of those kids started at the school with English as a first language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nuns divided the classes into two rooms. Sister Anthony taught grades 1, 2 and 3, and Sister Andrina taught grades 4, 5, 6 and 7. The classes were divided into those separate rows. It is a credit to those women that so many of those children left the school with scholarships. They were absolutely brilliant teachers, as other speakers have said today. There was something about the Brown Joeys that, somehow, the others just missed out on. They were superb women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sister Andrina coached the football side, and this was in the days of the nuns being in full drag&mdash;the heavy brown habits that they wore in those days. She would tuck up her habit, as far as modesty would allow, which was not very far, and she was one of the best drop punts in the south-east of South Australia. Unfortunately, the side she coached never won, but I am sure that if she had actually been playing in the side instead of coaching she would have done far better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a remarkable feat for those women to teach children from so many different backgrounds, and from such impoverished backgrounds as those of the migrants and refugees from the war, and to turn out so many reasonably educated kids for the Marist brothers to mess up later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mary MacKillop devoted her life, as you know, to educating those in need. She faced the challenge of her times with a loving and open heart; her motivation, an unbounded trust in God and his providence. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was delighted to attend the recent papal mass for her beatification. I am also very pleased that in my electorate of Lowe we still have Josephite nuns who are doing wonderful community work today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As our country heads towards the centenary of our federation, it is good to look at the difficulties faced by women and people without power and resources 100 years ago. There were no women ministers or department heads, no women journalists and opinion makers, no women judges or business leaders. In this world a woman from South Australia decided to dedicate her life to God through service to the poor people, amongst the poorest of whom she lived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her approach was very much in the mainstream of the Australian national character. Not for young Mary MacKillop was the life of the enclosed convent and formal prayer. Her Christianity was directed at action and a straightforward attack on what she identified as the single most damaging condition of the poor whom she saw around her&mdash;their lack of education. With education, all further improvements became possible. Without education, almost nothing could be built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mary MacKillop saw this and, like the best of Australian types, she tackled the problem head on. Putting together her order of nuns, the Josephites, Mary was greatly helped by a wide range of people&mdash;Catholic, non-Catholic, Christian and Jewish. As you would be aware, Mary MacKillop was excommunicated by Archbishop Reynolds, the Catholic Archbishop of Adelaide, for disobedience. She was trying to keep her nuns independent of the bishops and properly directed towards her agenda of educating the poor. Women trying to do things out of the control of men have always encountered problems from men, who are themselves sometimes the real problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this painful time, before the Pope had her excommunication lifted, Mary was assisted by Mrs Barr-Smith, who was an ancestor of the current member for Mayo (Mr Downer). Mrs Barr-Smith was not a Catholic but nevertheless came forward to help another good woman trying to do a difficult job. This story of interdenominational help is very much part of the Australian characteristic of inclusiveness and being able to see matters clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During her troubles with the local Catholic bishops, who worked tirelessly to undermine and defeat her, Mary MacKillop relied on her supporters, her prayers, her faith in Christ and the practical commonsense of the Vatican authorities, who ultimately ensured that the local bishops did not destroy what was obviously good and holy work being done by a great woman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The obstacles that presented themselves to the Josephite nuns in their very familiar brown habits were not only human. The harshness of the land, the heat, the drought, the flood and the distance were monumental in their impact. Yet the nuns persisted and the Australian communities rallied to them. Education for all who presented&mdash;be they black or white, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or pagan&mdash;was the bedrock principle from which this great Australian group has never resiled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a woman who was herself educated by Catholic nuns, I have the highest regard for them. Their example of selfless devotion and tireless works for others is a magnificent example for our younger generation. The great benefit I received was the encouragement from my teachers, especially from the nuns. When I expressed an interest in public affairs, they always urged me on. All my education was directed at the belief that being a woman did not mean that you could not aspire to higher learning, science, public life or the arts. This encouragement to girls has been vital to the development of Australia and is still needed today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefit of Mary MacKillop was that she targeted the problem of education and was not dissuaded by the bishops, the droughts or slander, of which she had her fair share. In her appeal to Rome she wrote the famous letter that explained her case. In this letter she used the sentence `I write as an Australian'. Her identification in colonial times not with her colony but with our nation, not yet legally born, shows her suitability for our times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She saw that Australia's future was education and unity. In this vision she and her nuns were ahead of the times. In her pride of being an Australian, without any hyphen, she is still in advance of some people today. As we move towards our next century of federation, perhaps we should look to seeing Mary MacKillop as a paradigm of an Australian. Her ingenuity, determination, intelligence and plain stubborn courage are Australian values that are accessible to all Australians, whether Catholic or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are advised on the best authority that `by their fruits you will know them'. The fruit of the life of the Blessed Mary MacKillop is all around us. It is in the education of hundreds of thousands of Australian children over the last century of our national life. It is the unknown work of assistance given to families hit hard by death, disease, unemployment and poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As our nation moves towards its future as a republic&mdash;like Mary MacKillop, I speak as an Australian&mdash;I can think of no more fitting accolade for Mary MacKillop than for this government to make a decision to engrave her effigy on the coinage of this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to support this motion moved in this House by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) regarding the beatification of Mother Mary MacKillop. I do not intend to speak for long, because I know a number of speakers wish to follow me. I want to say how pleased I was to see His Holiness Pope John Paul II come to Australia for the beatification ceremony. Every time I see this man&mdash;whether on television or personally, which is on a very rare occasion&mdash;I am filled with admiration because I think His Holiness is one of the great giants of this century. Through his association with Solidarity in Poland and the happenings in Eastern Europe, he was one of the major movers in bringing down the Iron Curtain. It would do a lot of us well to remember that, and I am sure most people do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was thinking about the pomp and ceremony at Randwick and at other places where the church and everyone else gathered to celebrate the beatification. Then my thoughts went back to the Josephite sisters as they sat in bush huts teaching young students&mdash;to the heat, the flies and the dust. Some of us who have lived in the bush have been in that situation and know what it is like. In those days, a century ago, just imagine it: no clean water, very little breeze coming through the place and the sisters in their brown habits trying to teach the students. It must have been very difficult for them. If we go to some of the old convents in the more isolated areas and see some of the conditions under which they lived, we must marvel at their dedication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first came into contact with the Josephite nuns in Adelaide when I had some Josephite teachers. I know many people here have talked about their love and devotion and about what wonderful teachers the sisters were. As I found out, they could also be very strict disciplinarians. I have certainly had my share of hidings, I suppose I could say, from the sisters, but all done with love and with worry about the future of the students they were teaching. I suppose this is an opportunity for me in the federal parliament to thank those sisters for the work they did in keeping me on the straight and narrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now I represent the seat of Riverina, and the sisters are represented there.

Nevertheless, with the diminishing numbers that they have, they do a tremendous job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was thinking also about our Australian heritage and about the part the sisters played in that. When we go to some of our bush towns we find first of all the bush hall and the bush pub, and then the war memorial in the town square and the different churches&mdash;the Uniting Church, the Presbyterian Church and, of course, the Catholic Church with its presbytery and convent alongside. Some of those now are of great significance to our heritage and a lot of them are being preserved. I cannot imagine Mother Mary MacKillop thinking in the old days, when sitting in some of the old iron shanties and wooden huts, that some of the buildings that her sisters built would later on be an important part of our heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I sit down I would like to pay tribute to all our clergy, ministers, priests, brothers and nuns in Australia for the work they have done and continue to do in educating young people and in caring for the poor and the sick. One thing that Mother Mary MacKillop taught us is that her work is of an ecumenical nature. The faith of the people who supported her or whom she supported did not matter; she was there to look after them, care for them and guide them. She was a truly great Australian, and I am sure that Mother Mary MacKillop is watching over the nation today and bringing her blessings to us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great pleasure in joining with my colleagues and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in speaking to this motion. While I was listening to the earlier contributions, I was wondering to myself whether, if Mary MacKillop was around in Australia today, she would be all that comfortable with this motion. This is not the sort of thing that Mary MacKillop, from what one reads of her or from what one learns from nuns one talks with, would have felt all that comfortable with&mdash;the Pope coming here for a specific beatification mass for her; all the bishops of Australia lining up to say what a wonderful thing that was, and the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) standing up in the national parliament and eulogising her. I have no doubt she would never have thought that that would happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the life that Mary MacKillop led shows what a person she was. It seemed that she was meeting opposition every way she turned and yet she has been able to inspire people for so long to continue her work. Mary MacKillop, Blessed Mary of the Cross, was obviously a prayerful person and a person who dedicated her life to both God and the poor. She founded an order of nuns which had a rather different rule in those days from the rule of many other orders of nuns. Probably because her rule was different she ran into some difficulties with the bishops. Of course, one of those bishops was also a bishop of a monastic order from which some orders of nuns in those days had sprung. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember my sister&mdash;who at one stage was in one of those orders&mdash;telling me she believed that nuns were the first feminists and that, in times when women had a particular place in society, nuns were the only people able to go outside of that mould of being seen and not heard. She said that convents and orders of nuns often gave women an amount of power that they did not have in the normal society of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People might have been a little concerned about the fact that Mary MacKillop said she wanted to change some of the structures of the time. The Catholic Church was pretty comfortable with state aid at the time&mdash;I suppose it is comfortable with state aid now&mdash;but Mary MacKillop challenged that and said the Catholic Church should do something different. She said that it should teach in schools it did not own, that the order should not own buildings, and that those in the order should lead a life of poverty and service. She felt that the best way for her to serve God was by serving her fellow human beings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mary MacKillop and Father Woods founded an order that has kept to that rule and has spread right throughout Australia and the world. As other members here have said, around Australia in particular the Josephite nuns have taught generations of people and have given them the desire to go on and better serve their fellow Australians. Unfortunately, I am not able to say that I went to a Josephite school but my wife did, so the intelligent part of our family has obviously been affected by the Josephites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that Mary MacKillop is an inspiration to all Australians. She said in her life&mdash;and showed by her life&mdash;that you had to serve people of all religious points of view and not just one in particular. She was dedicated to educating young people, whether they were Catholics, non-Catholics or people of no religion at all. The rule she gave the nuns&mdash;that they should have a particular visitation role with the poor and the sick&mdash;was something that obviously endeared the Josephite nuns to us. That rule endeared the Josephite nuns to those in rural communities in Australia in particular, as the nuns both served an educative role and did a lot to help keep towns together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Watson, Sydney, there are a large number of Josephite schools. The school at Campsie is one of the earlier schools, if not the first school, that the Josephite nuns started in New South Wales. As the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) mentioned, unfortunately, we are seeing fewer nuns in those schools than we saw in the past. But I think that all Australians can join together and take a lot of satisfaction from the beatification of Mother Mary MacKillop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to place on record the work of a friend of mine, Martin Nesbitt, who was very much in the forefront of the movement to have Mother Mary beatified and who unfortunately died before that occurred. He would have been very satisfied a few weeks ago if he could have been at the beatification mass at Randwick racecourse. I am very pleased to join with my colleagues here today in paying tribute to a person who was a great Australian and who can be a good role model for all of us in the more secular times of the 1990s. She showed us that there is great merit in serving one's fellow human beings and that probably one of the best ways to serve God is to do that. I thank the House. </PARA>

It rained and rained so she could not continue to teach. She went to the nearest house and knocked on the door. She said, `I would like to bring my class in. I would like to teach them.' It was a Presbyterian House. Mary MacKillop took her class in. She did not teach there on just one occasion; it was something that went on for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mary MacKillop was a woman who had the daring to confront the orthodoxies of the day. She was someone who was fought against by those who exercised power, but she had the courage of her own convictions plus her belief and her faith. She fought a long, hard fight. What is remarkable when reading about what she wrote is that she never railed against the bishops who fought her so hard. She was never vindictive. She was constrained in her language. She acknowledged their positions, but she basically said, `Change has to take place.' As I said, she was a woman who had tolerance and who exercised tolerance. I agree with others when they said that she was a woman who set a fine example. The Josephite nuns of today are women whom I admire in their commitment, their tenacity and their joy in seeing the beatification of the Blessed Mary MacKillop. </PARA>

She brought credit because she stood up for what she believed in. She fought those who had power and the orthodoxies of the day. She has finally made her mark in a way that I agree she would never have sought. The honour given to me to take part in the launch of that official biography left with me a feeling of warmth and admiration. As I said, I support the motion because I believe it is a celebration that all Australians can take part in, irrespective of the particular faith they follow. </PARA>

When the present Leader of the Opposition left office as Treasurer, the rate of inflation was 11.4 per cent. The current rate of inflation is 2.5 per cent and the underlying rate is 2.1 per cent. It went from 11.4 to 2.1 per cent. That reflected the whole interest rate structure of the day. The 90-day bill rate in his day, March 1983, was 15.9 per cent and in January 1995 it was 8.2 per cent. Remember this? The home mortgage rate, which was a regulated rate only for those lucky people who could get a loan, was 13.5 per cent. Of course, left to its price in a deregulated market it would have been up to 16 or 17 per cent. In December 1994, it was 10.5 per cent. Have you got that? One-zero-point-five per cent. It is a bit rich for the opposition, which could never as a government deal with inflation and hence deal with interest rates, to be putting questions to the government when the government has made a number of quick and successive monetary adjustments which I think have had the effect of appropriately slowing the economy&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, perhaps I could begin again and respond to the question. To get the economy for the last year into perspective, we have to understand that our GDP was growing somewhere between 5 1/2 per cent to six per cent with inflation around two per cent, and in the last calendar year employment growth was 3.6 per cent. That, I think, is probably the strongest conjunction of figures since the war.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government set a job creation goal of 500,000 jobs in three years. We are 95 per cent on the way to that target in two years. There has been an extraordinary fall in long-term unemployment of 61,500, the highest ever labour force participation by women in the economy of 52.9 per cent and labour productivity growth over the last year of four per cent against the sorts of averages of the 1970s and 1980s of 1 1/2 per cent or 1.6 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economy is now slowing in some areas. The dwelling sector has peaked, consumer and business confidence levels have eased back from their peaks, real growth in retail trade is below the September quarter, we are starting to see the fiscal stimulus being unwound and, therefore, demand is starting to drift back more towards GDP growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been made of the current account deficit. Let me say a couple of things about this in the reflection of these quite extraordinarily good numbers for Australia in the economy in the last 12 months. The current account deficit is certainly relatively high, but the situation is so much better than in the past where the extraordinary health and robust strength of the economy is a completely different fact of life from what it was in 1985 or 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the current account deficit was last this high, in 1985 or 1986, the ratio of exports to GDP was 15 per cent. We were exporting 15 per cent of all we produced. Today we are exporting 22 per cent&mdash;half as much again. The debt service ratio, when the current account was last this large, stood at 21 per cent of GDP&mdash;in other words, 21 per cent of our debt servicing requirements, 21 per cent of our product. Today that is 11 per cent. So exports have gone up by half since then and the debt service ratio has come down by half.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our international competitiveness is 40 per cent better than when John Howard left office as Treasurer. Let me repeat the number, because around most OECD countries these sorts of statistics can never be mentioned with any veracity. The Australian economy, on the Treasury's latest statistics, is 40 per cent more competitive than in the last days and weeks that John Howard spent as Treasurer. It is because of that 40 per cent improvement in competitiveness that exports have gone up by half to 22 per cent of GDP and the debt service ratio has come down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, yes, the current account deficit is relatively high, but the circumstances are completely different from 1985-86. When juxtaposed against 477,000 jobs, 5 1/2 to six per cent growth, two per cent inflation and four per cent productivity, when did anyone in this House ever hear numbers like that? Never. Ian Sinclair is the only one who has been here longer than I and he never heard of them in his days here. John Howard never heard of them when he was Treasurer. Let us get this, as the questioner said, in perspective.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Treasurer will make clear, a lot of the growth in the current account deficit is coming from strong investment numbers in the economy. I want the House to recall that at the end of the last election campaign, two opposition leaders ago, the member for Wentworth said that Australia was in a double dip recession, and then in the last week of the campaign he said we were heading into a depression. Six per cent growth puts the lie to that. In the budget debate, the shadow Treasurer said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The business investment figures are crucial to the whole budget. If they don't come in, the budget falls apart. A dark cloud hangs over the future recovery. Business investment is dead in the water. There has simply been no recovery in investment.</PARA>
<PARA>That was last May when the Treasurer was forecasting 14.5 per cent for investment growth. What is it now? It is 24 per cent. That massive growth in the strength of our capital base, in our productive capacity, because we are not a producer goods nation in terms of mainframe computers and digitally operated machine tools, comes by way of the current account deficit from imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer gave a first-class example yesterday in respect of an LNG carrier costing $300 million on the current account, but carrying $150 million a year of produce year in year out for Australia. I think these numbers need to be put in perspective. Yes, the current account is high, but the conditions are completely different from 1985-86. We have peeled away the restrictive layers of tariffs, the regulated exchange rate of the sclerotic financial markets that John Howard left this country. Today we have an externally oriented 40 per cent more competitive supple, modern Australian economy. If you are out there in the business of looking up polls&mdash;and you all regard yourselves as amateur pollsters, although the last election reveals that none of you knew the code to the poll; none of you understood the code&mdash;let me tell you what the code is.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to do so. I can say that there are some encouraging prospects for improvement in the balance of payments in the medium term, but I must say at the outset that does not remove the need for action to be taken to improve it further. Let me refer to some of the factors which give us that confidence for improvement in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that rural exports at the present time are being affected by the drought. The impact on the balance of payments this year of the drought and reduced rural exports is about $2 billion. There are now signs of the drought breaking, with recent rains. If it does completely break, we can expect rural exports to recover quite strongly after this year. Rural commodity prices are increasing. They are up 11 per cent in the last 12 months, in the year to January. That will gradually feed into actual export prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non-rural commodity exports have fallen this year. They are down 7.2 per cent in the first half of the year, or about $1.2 billion. This is because of falls in volumes in some cases and price falls in others. A good example of volume fall is gold. It appears that previous stockpiling by the buyers of gold overseas has meant they are running down their stocks at the present time and reducing their purchases from us. That has reduced our sales of gold by about $500 million in half a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With coal and iron ore, it is essentially a price factor. As members would be aware, in the negotiations last year with the Japanese there was a further reduction in prices. That was about the fourth year in a row for iron ore, but that has now been turned around with a seven per cent increase from April of this year. The producers of coal are currently renegotiating their price contracts in Japan, and they also expect prices to rise after several years of falling prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the outlook for commodity prices remains positive because of expectations of continued economic growth in Japan and Europe&mdash;increasing growth&mdash;and declining world base metal stocks. The growth in Australia's major trading partners is around 4 1/2 per cent and is expected to be that over the next year or two. That is solid growth which should serve our non-rural exports quite well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of resource exports, we will benefit from some expansion to our mining capacity. In addition to the commissioning of several new mines, there have been a number of significant expansions to existing mines. New mines which have come on-stream recently or which are expected to commence soon include the Mt Keith nickel mine, the Marandoo iron ore mine and the McArthur River lead and zinc mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen exports of manufactured goods and services grow very strongly since the mid-1980s because of the factors referred to by the Prime Minister earlier&mdash;our greatly improved competitiveness and the fact that those industries have become much more export oriented. Manufactured exports have trebled in the eight years since 1985-86 and services have almost trebled. While those rates of growth are down somewhat this year, the continued improvement in rates of growth in the rest of the world should see them pick up again in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major factor in the strong growth of imports at the moment is increased business investment which, as we know, is now growing at 24 per cent. Likewise, we have seen imports of capital goods increase by 24 per cent in the first half of this financial year. Next year we would not expect business investment to grow at such a remarkable rate, so we would expect there to be less pressure on imports&mdash;although we would expect that business investment next year will still be quite strong. Also, these imports add to productive capacity and future export potential. The LNG tanker is a good example of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also expect the rates of growth for demand and output to come much closer together next year than they are at present. As members are aware, currently there is a gap of something like two per cent between the rates of growth for demand and output. That is spilling over into imports and giving us a substantial increase in the current account deficit. We expect that gap to narrow without doing anything else; just with what is in place at present. As the Prime Minister said earlier, we expect that gap to narrow very considerably, so there will be less spilling over into imports as a result of that narrowing. If we take further action, as I have foreshadowed in relation to the budget, there will be an even narrower gap than would otherwise be the case. Hopefully, there will not be any such gap and we will not have the spilling over of demand into imports in the way that we have seen in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By having that tightening we will also improve our savings performance. That is absolutely essential for continued improvement in our current account deficit and in order to give us a rate of growth for the economy which is sustainable. Of course, that is what we all want to see&mdash;strong, sustainable growth. At the moment growth is exceedingly strong. We can see that growth pared back a little to sustainable levels and still have very good outcomes&mdash;still see employment growing strongly, still see the unemployment rate coming down, still see real wages and real household disposable incomes continuing to rise. That is what Australians want.</PARA>

This has been the Commonwealth's approach to dealing with this stress on the issue of the environment versus the timber industry and creating ways of getting agreement across the Commonwealth for the development of regional forest agreements. A regional forest agreement can then look at all of the values of a state or a particular area of a state and representative reserve systems can be established.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the opposition continues to talk down the economy it fails to give due credit to those industries, such as the telecommunications industry, that are investing, employing and increasing exports in Australia. Since the mid-1980s, this government has introduced a whole series of reforms that have introduced a competitive regime in telecommunications. That has encouraged the growth of investment in manufacturing of telecommunications equipment. In particular, it has encouraged the carriers to invest billions of dollars in improving the telecommunications infrastructure here in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is not too interested in an industry that is generating a lot of jobs and is positioning Australia for the next century. Let me tell you, Mr Speaker, that this industry's investment in capital equipment is showing. It has increased exports to some extent, but there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of equipment supplied by the domestic telecommunications manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent report of the Telecommunications Industry Development Authority has made it clear that about 70 per cent of that massive investment in equipment is Australian content. We have seen export sales of telecommunications go from $50 million a decade ago, when the policies of the Leader of the Opposition were affecting the industry, to more than $800 million this year. So from that $50 million in exports to $800 million in exports, which is directly the result of this government's industry development arrangements, we will continue to ensure further growth in exports in this sector. The growth at the moment is 28 per cent per annum&mdash;a 28 per cent compound. Not too many industries can match that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, this competition has meant that consumers are also getting the benefits. Whether they are residential or corporate customers, consumers these days are benefiting by more than $300 million a year because of the competition that has been introduced in telecommunications. So, as a result of the policies of this government there are lower prices for consumers, greater investment and more jobs in manufacturing&mdash;</PARA>

We were told two days ago by the Treasurer that the estimate of the current account deficit had blown out from $18 billion to $26 billion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one thing that the Australian people cannot understand. If you took time off from your political hobbies and became a full-time Prime Minister again instead of a part-time Prime Minister, you might spend a bit of time going around talking to the Australian people. You might hear them saying one thing; they would say it in different ways. Some of them would say it politely and some of them would say it ever so impolitely. What they would say is a very simple thing: `I don't understand this. Our Prime Minister told us that if we endured the pain of the recession there would be some dividend, there would be some gain.' In other words, if we suffered the pain and the discomfort of high interest rates, if we lived through the difficulty of bankruptcy and failure if we were a small business operator and if we lived through the agony of our children being out of work year after year&mdash;not because they were stupid or indolent but because they could not get a job&mdash;maybe at the end of the road there would be a little gain as a result of all of that pain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course I reject out of hand the claims of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and just say: it will take more than the recitation of glib lines from a person without any original political thoughts. For a person who is a part-time thinker and who has no original political ideas, it will take more than a decade long recitation of old rhetoric to win the next election for you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not by accident that the Liberal Party passed over John Howard when John Hewson lost the last election. It was not by accident they passed over John Howard to go to Alexander Downer after John Hewson was removed. He is the Liberal Party's third preference but in his arrogance he wants himself to be Australia's first preference. This is the man who, after seven years of opportunity, left behind a moribund, inward looking industrial graveyard, a low growth, low investment, low profit, high inflation, high interest rates, high unemployment, high tariff country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And nobody can deny any one of those claims. You had low growth averaging less than two per cent, low investment, low profits, 11 per cent inflation, 22 per cent in interest rates at their peak, high unemployment&mdash;10 1/2 per cent&mdash;high and growing tariffs and, undeniably, on top of all that, an unproductive, inward looking economy. As I said in the House at question time today, the Australian economy is 40 per cent more competitive. Can you believe that any minister in an OECD country can quote a gap, a differential improvement of that dimension to a nation's competitors, of 40 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian economy today is 40 per cent more competitive than when he was in office. I will tell you what else he left behind&mdash;a criminal tax avoidance system; a criminally evaded tax base. I will tell you what else he did. When you thumb through the then tax commissioner Bill O'Reilly's telephone book of letters you see him pleading to the clever little Treasurer, being silly and civil, understanding but not hearing, `Please, Treasurer, help us put a suture on the criminal avoidance of the tax system.' For five years as Treasurer, he failed to do anything until the McCabe-Lafranchi report was presented, which he called a stunt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he had any pride, he would run himself out of public life. Let us get the record straight. Apart from that inward looking, moribund economy he left&mdash;the principal charge against him&mdash;in terms of the recession he presided over, 4.1 per cent of GDP was lost. In 1990-91 it was 1.8 per cent. He has the prize for having the deepest recession since the war&mdash;and if he wants to debate that he should go and debate it with the Australian Statistician. Go to the Australian Statistician and ask him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then he had the temerity to talk about tax cuts. This is the man who at the 1977 election said, `Ring up and find out how much the tax cuts will be.' The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> had a picture of the hand holding the fist full of dollars. Then he took them away five months later. You humbug!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I became Treasurer he was like a man reborn. He sat on the opposition benches thanking God that somebody could inherit the problem and do something with it. Here he is, after 12 years of change&mdash;12 years that has made us the fastest growing economy in the Western world with the lowest inflation rate&mdash;on that combination bringing his miserable political carcass back to the opposition front bench of the Australian parliament. Here he is politically limping in like the Bishop of Autun, the Talleyrand of the Liberal Party, scraping his way back into Australian history, seeking to put his miserable politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What possible use could a modern Australia&mdash;a country joining its region for the first time in its history, becoming an outward looking country, getting low inflation and high productivity&mdash;have for a man who describes himself as the most conservative leader the Liberal Party has ever had? What use do you think you are to indigenous Australia? What use do you think you are to Asia, to our immigration?  What use do you think you are to best practice?  What use do you think you are to high investment? What use do you think you are to high participation rates in schools?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was quite happy when he was in government to see fewer than three kids in 10 complete secondary school. Now it is eight in 10, and for the first time in our history more girls than boys are going to university. More young women than young men are going to university. He left them. He said, `If we keep them uneducated we can run this as a sort of narrow elite in a sort of tied-up education system.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has had only three policies in public life. I have been here with him. He came in 1974. In his political life he has believed in income splitting for families to give income to the high income earners, and labour market reform, which is code for cutting the wages of people under $35,000. He has opposed every wage increase since 1983 for the work force&mdash;every single one&mdash;through the centralised wage fixing system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He believes in an American style system where you have the American President standing before the Congress. Three weeks ago in his State of the Union address the President was talking about the American working poor who have not had a wage increase in 17 years. That is the kind of Australia John Howard wants. He believes: rip the safety net from underneath them and they have got to take the contract&mdash;the same as America. They huddle over the railway grates for warmth under a newspaper, or live in substandard accommodation, or live without health care. That is the sort of Australia this conservative apparatchik believes in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, we have this sort of morbid rhetoric&mdash;the sort of small thrifty shopkeeper gnarlishness with the red tape of government spending. We have all this anti-government spending rhetoric but, in his day, he was the big spender&mdash;Mr 28.8 per cent of GDP. Look, John, do not waste your time on me, son. I have been around. I know you. I know where the skeletons are in your closet. I know what Bill O'Reilly said to me in private about you as Treasurer and the criminal evasion of the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know how the tax office guys hung their heads, but when I said, `We are going to basically fight the High Court on the tax base; we are actually going to improve the tax base and make it impregnable; we are going to bring in low tax rates and encourage greater compliance with the system,' the whole bureaucracy lifted its head as if it was a new day&mdash;a new dawning. That was the dawning of integrity in Australian public finances. And yet, Mr Speaker, the most conservative leader the Liberal Party has ever had wants to talk about the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is 6.1 per cent growth and 3 3/4 per cent employment growth and the greatest fall in unemployment in a year not about the future? Is the white paper on the unemployed, to retrain Australia's long-term unemployed and young people&mdash;the greatest undertaking we have made in social policy since the war&mdash;not about the future? Was the cultural policy of support for the arts and multimedia and CD-ROM and the information highway not about the future? Was APEC, building for Australia abroad and Asia and Pacific rim markets not about the future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are you telling us you could have done it? Would you have threaded together APEC? Would you have believed in the social and cultural liberation of the cultural policy statement? Would you have believed in giving long-term unemployed Australians income support, a job subsidy and a job compact? No way. Your then Leader of the Opposition attacked it. In relation to the white paper he said, `Labor's spending spree. Whatever the merits or otherwise it is a spending spree'. That is the contempt in which you held it. That is not about the future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we hear from John Howard, the very much recycled Leader of the Opposition, it is a case of back to the future. Years ago I did a little ditty in here about a family walking through a museum. They are looking around and the kid says, `Mum, what's that?' She says, `Well, son, that is the Morphy Richards toaster. We used to have one. We used to put the bread in that. You had to wind it down and turn it on.' The kid says, `What's this?' She says, `That is the Qualcast mower. We had one of those at home'. He says, `Who is this?' She says, `That's John Howard. He was the Treasurer who put Australia into moribund low growth back in the 1970s and the 1980s.' The boy says, `But what is he, Mum?' She says, `He is the future, son'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Don't make us laugh over there. John Howard believes in the glib phrase. Somebody said the other day, `He just keeps on talking. He will do as many radio interviews as possible. He will keep running the line through.' But that will not change the central fact because, as I said at question time, when people go through the polls and they understand the code, the code is the one thing that he shies away from like Dracula from a wooden stake, and that is J-O-B-S&mdash;the one thing you have never been able to produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you know what John Howard's average was in jobs? It was 52,000 a year. In the years of his treasurership it was a pathetic 52,000 a year. Do you know what this government's average was right through the 12 years? One hundred and fifty four thousand a year&mdash;three times as great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell you another thing about employment. Let me give you another reasonably impressive statistic. Do you know what the change is in real household disposable income? You know what that means. Do you know what the change in real household disposable income is since you? It is 40 per cent. The nation's household disposable income has come up by 40 per cent; that is the change since you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet you say, in your tawdry opportunist way, that we have skittled families and small business. Yes, you believe in families. You arrogantly believe that you can speak for families, as if there is something you know about families that the rest of us do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You say you believe in families. Yet you do not believe in family support. You do not believe in payments to low paid families. You do not believe in a family allowance supplement or additional family payment. You do not believe in Medicare. You have been trying to give a kick-up to doctors for the last 20 years of your life. Let us not burden you with families because families are affected by those people coming back into jobs through the white paper. They are the ones for whom you think it is a spending spree, those very same families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He talks about interest rates and small business. Small business died when he was in office. He left an industrial graveyard&mdash;industrial archaeology&mdash;in his wake. It was basically the old anvil industries of the pre-war years. They were watching them close in Alexandria and in all the industrial areas across Australia. When he walked out of office he walked out with his head down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let the people of Australia understand: this is the same guy, with no new ideas, only the same simple ideas. They are basically about cutting income for people on low and middle incomes, keeping income up to the rich, not understanding Australia's place in the world, not understanding Australia's psychology or its identity, of having loyalty to other countries and other forums and other norms, and being out of touch with the modern Australia. John Howard would be a disaster for this country, a poor choice for the Liberal Party and an absolutely disastrous choice for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, it is with pleasure that I second the motion. If we are going to get into spelling words, there is one other word I would like to spell out to the House at this moment. After that disgraceful performance by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), if he is politically something it is this&mdash;he is  politically d-e-a-d. He is politically dead after being done over by one of the most comprehensive speeches by a Leader of the Opposition ever given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had from the Prime Minister the recycled approach. We had the accusations and allegations from the Prime Minister, dwelling on the so-called criminal taxation policy development. But who is the only Treasurer of this country to be a criminal and fail to put in an income tax return? It is none other than the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech the Prime Minister referred to the need for Australia to build links with other nations, and to build its timber industry product exports and to reverse the situation where Australia is a massive net importer of timber products&mdash;to use one industry. But let me take the Prime Minister back to 1957. Who was it that brought about the breakthrough in building a trade treaty between Australia and Japan and between Australia and Korea? It was the coalition government that had the foresight to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come forward to last year, to 1994. When the coalition was in government, under Malcolm Fraser and Doug Anthony, it developed special extensive relations between Australia and New Zealand and negotiated the crucial CER agreement between Australia and New Zealand. Guess what happened last year in relation to that, and costing Australian inbound tourism industry jobs? Guess what really happened, drawing the ire of the Premier of Queensland, Premier Goss? The Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) did a backroom deal. They pulled the pin on Air New Zealand and brought in protection in the skies, not in Australia's national interest, and jeopardised the whole spirit of CER. So in terms of externalities it is the coalition that has the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want to get down to just one other point with regard to the Prime Minister, if you want to get down to a criterion that really counts, turn to none other than the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine. Do honourable members remember the Prime Minister quoting the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> from time to time?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An English magazine which the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and others choose to quote. In this particular edition on page 20 is a table which perhaps goes to the core frustration of so many people seeking work at this time and so many people worried about their jobs at this time. It relates to the gap between rich and poor in Australia after 12 years of Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that table show? It shows that the gap is greater in Australia than in all other OECD countries but one. The gap between rich and poor is greater in Australia than in New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Sweden and Japan. Twelve years of Labor has enlarged the gap between rich and poor. That is the true legacy of this federal Labor government. That is why the government will perish at the next federal election, whenever it has the courage to bring it on, and that is why we stand ready to do battle with the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing we did not hear from the Prime Minister was any detailed defence of the government's record. We know why. It is not only the gap between rich and poor but our national debt figure detailed so clearly by the Leader of the Opposition, a range of other factors and the internal agony of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want now to bring to the House for the first time a copy of a letter from one member of this dispirited government: the member for Lyons (Mr Adams). He was perhaps trying to make some effort to save the jobs of some Tasmanian timber workers. He wrote to his colleagues last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While all that was happening those of us who might have been able to facilitate a more rational outcome couldn't get anywhere near the key decision makers. The fact that important information reaches the green lobby several days before it reaches the unions, industry or the Government, is a solid indicator that we need a major overhaul of decision-making processes.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the letter from the member for Lyons. Let him come in here and deny it. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can tell you that the claims made about the conservation values of a whole swag of primarily National Estate forests in Tasmania are simply not true.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is&mdash;a government member letting the cat out of the bag. You are guilty with regard to process in relation to the timber industry and you are guilty with regard to outcome and lack of outcome with regard to the timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why this week, in conjunction with all my colleagues&mdash;including the shadow minister for environment and heritage, the shadow minister for primary industry and our senatorial colleagues&mdash;I have tried to bring this timber industry debate back to where it belongs: with the national forest policy statement signed a couple of years ago. The tragedy is that that statement was never acted on and never implemented, because the Commonwealth government never gave the criteria to the state governments to proceed with their regional plans and assessments. It is not a bad document. It is a good baseline for getting it right in the timber industry, for getting the answers that should have been out months ago, not the shemozzle we have every 12 months, which this time has got out of hand because of the total inadequacy of Minister Beddall and Minister Faulkner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where did that incredible list come from? How can you stand up and defend that extraordinary list, the core of the Prime Minister's decision making announcements of last Friday?It is a case of getting back to the drawing board, and fast, so the people who have been peacefully demonstrating this week in and around Canberra, as is their democratic right, can have some clear-cut answers with regard to their future jobs.

I told them when both houses were sitting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the people who are presently in the gallery may have been out there listening this morning when I spoke just after the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, Ian Armstrong. I said that both houses were scheduled to have question time today, the exact timing of which is not always known or familiar to members of the public. Sometimes they do not quite realise when question time is held. So I explained that question time is at 2 o'clock in the Senate and at 3 o'clock in the House of Representatives. I explained that I had asked a question of Minister Beazley yesterday and I hoped that there would be questions from members on both sides of the House today to the Prime Minister on this occasion&mdash;the first time this year that he has finally graced us with his presence in the parliament. I think that is a perfectly reasonable explanation. It was interesting that the Prime Minister did not seem to pursue the matter during his privileged visit to the parliament this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say how grateful the opposition is, how grateful the Australian public is, how grateful, perhaps, the timber workers are, that finally our part-time Prime Minister has decided to put in a day's work and turn up at the dispatch box in the House of Representatives&mdash;a little overdue. Can I say how humble we are to see the Prime Minister in the parliament today actually answering questions for the first time this year. We are delighted to see that he is man enough, for one day out of this whole parliamentary week, to attempt to answer some excellent questions from the coalition. </PARA>

We see all around us evidence of his government's tremendous achievements&mdash;timber workers and environmentalists alike; the army of the unemployed; average Australians all over the country who are delighted to be paying what I think the Prime Minister called a dividend in the form of horrific increasing interest rates to keep their jobs and to keep growth! Enough of the sarcasm; this Prime Minister and this government are an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can you trust the Prime Minister and the Treasurer on the matter of interest rates? You simply cannot. How can you trust the Prime Minister and the Treasurer on the matter of a taxation structure for the next budget? You cannot.

How can you even trust the Prime Minister to successfully open one simple thing&mdash;a north-south runway at Mascot?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The performance of this government is an absolute disgrace. It has not learnt that if you do not stick to an agreed and orderly process of conservation evaluation with regard to the timber industry and correct forest policy processes, the result will be what we see all around this building today. This is not just an argy-bargy argument between timber workers and environmentalists. This is a complete failure of government policy process to arrive at decisions on time, in time to protect jobs and in a fair-mannered and properly constructed way. Indeed, it is a total failing of not only Minister Beddall but also previous ministers who have held this portfolio, including the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), Senator Cook and others. They have all been sitting on this policy statement, along with environment ministers. </PARA>

As well, Premier Wayne Goss of Queensland; the then Premier of Western Australia&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;Dr Carmen Lawrence; and the Premier of South Australia, Lynn Arnold, also signed the policy statement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">This government is always happy to have a debate about jobs. I wish to give the House one statistic about jobs which sums up the difference between the two parties. When the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer, his government managed to produce 260,000 jobs in five years. This year alone, we will create 300,000 jobs. What a massive difference. What an extraordinary difference in the ability of governments to produce jobs for the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That one statistic says everything about the capacity of the two sides of this House. There is one side which can deliver&mdash;it has delivered nearly two million jobs since it has been in government, and has produced 300,000 jobs in this one year&mdash;and there is an opposition which, during the five years when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, produced fewer than 300,000 jobs. What a comparison that is. It says a lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate today also says a lot. It is the first censure motion by the third opposition leader in eight months. What did he have to say? A censure motion is a serious debate in the parliament. We are supposed to treat it very seriously and listen closely to what the opposition has to say. That is the form of the House. You listen to find out whether there is anything the opposition says which might make one think it should be the government rather than the opposition. Could anyone listening to the effort by the Leader of the Opposition today really feel that he would be the next Prime Minister of this country? How could you possibly have that view? There was not one shred of substance&mdash;not one element&mdash;which showed any thinking about policy whatever.

It is an appalling indictment of the new Leader of the Opposition, who stands up here today with a record as a failed Treasurer and a failed Leader of the Opposition. He has been recycled again to supposedly offer some hope to the Australian people that the opposition might be a credible alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did he produce today? A load of garbage. Not one sensible idea was put forward&mdash;not even a skerrick of an idea. That in itself is an indictment, but it is just running  true to form. Because that is what we have heard from opposition members. Since they abandoned Fightback, they essentially do not know where they are. With Fightback, at least they had some semblance of what they stood for. When the Australian people examined that document, they realised it was a particularly nasty piece of goods and were not going to have anything of it. Now that those opposite have abandoned it, they are just floating around in a policy vacuum. They have not got any idea what they stand for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they do indicate a direction, is there any substance behind it? No. You never hear any substance. They say that they want to reduce the deficit. By how much? They will never say. They do say that it should be done by cuts in government expenditure. What cuts in government expenditure? You never hear any details about cuts in government expenditure because they have not got the guts, intelligence or policy framework to put forward a sensible array&mdash;or any sort&mdash;of specific proposals. They are trying to run for government. They are trying to tell the Australian people that they have something to offer, but they have nothing of substance to provide at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy of the previous Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), was to keep whatever he had&mdash;which you could probably put in your pocket; it was probably an absolutely empty array of ideas&mdash;to himself until the election was announced. He was going to say, `Hey, presto, here's our set of ideas to show that we should be the alternative government.' He probably hoped that, in the course of an election campaign, no-one would have time to look at them properly. What a pathetic, cowardly approach that is! One would hope the new leader would not be such a coward as to pursue that policy. But judging by today he is. He censures the government, but he has not one constructive idea to put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the sorts of things that the Leader of the Opposition was complaining about. He criticised the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his management of the economy and his threats to impose new burdens on Australian families through higher interest rates and higher taxation. The hypocrisy of that is just appalling. It comes from a man who, when Treasurer, had interest rates and taxation higher than they are now. Yet he comes in here and says what a terrible thing it is that there has been some increase in interest rates recently&mdash;after a long period of decline&mdash;and that there might be some increases in taxation. As the Prime Minister said in his contribution today, he was taxing two per cent of GDP more than we are&mdash;that is, $10 billion a year; about $550 per man, woman and child in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet he comes in here and says what a terrible thing we are doing to the Australian people. If we had his tax regime, the Australian people would be paying a lot more tax&mdash;$550 more per person. That is the situation. We have reduced tax. We are in one of the lowest taxed countries in the Western world. In those circumstances, to suggest there is something heinous in any suggestion that there might be any increase in any tax at any time is just an absurdity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also say on the subject of taxation that I cannot stand the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition. He came into this place today and complained about our taking away tax cuts which were said to be l-a-w law. In fact, the first tranche of those tax cuts was paid 7 1/2 months early. The second lot was certainly put off, but its eventual outcome will be announced in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the real hypocrisy comes from the fact that when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer back in 1978, he was the man who knocked off tax cuts which had been promised at the previous election and put into l-a-w law. He turned them around. Those opposite went to the election in 1977 in a fistful of dollars campaign and told the Australian people, `If you elect us you will get big tax cuts.' Several months later, in the budget of 1978, the now Leader of the Opposition, as Treasurer, said, `That was the situation; but now we are going to impose an income tax surcharge.' They halved tax indexation which effectively took away, for most people, the whole of the tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a total repudiation of the election promise. That, in itself, makes it extraordinary that he can come into this place now and make a great feature&mdash;supposedly&mdash;of the fact that there has been some change in our position in terms of tax cuts. We delivered the first tranche absolutely, 7 1/2 months early, whereas he totally overturned the tax cuts which had been put into legislation by the Fraser government before the election; they were taken away after the election. What an incredibly hypocritical approach!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition says that after 12 years in office the Prime Minister is to be censured for failing to tackle the fundamental problems of Australia's current account deficit. The problems of the current account are not new in this country. We had a current account deficit of 5 1/2 per cent of GDP back in 1981-82. Who was the Treasurer? It was the present Leader of the Opposition. That current account deficit in effect was the beginning of the increase in the foreign debt of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increasing foreign debt, which is also mentioned in the censure motion, has been a matter for some comment by a well-known Liberal, Mr Michael Warby, who wrote an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS> of 19 May 1994 entitled `The Liberal Party: Past, Present and Future'. Mr Warby is also a member of the Federal Council of the Liberal Party so what he has to say I guess has a particular importance. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fraser Government's performance was, to be blunt, poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fraser government presided over the period when high inflation, mass unemployment and plummeting national saving rates became entrenched, and growth in living standards stagnated.</PARA>
<PARA>That is his summation of the Fraser government of which John Howard was the Treasurer for five years. Mr Warby continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even on foreign debt, the Fraser Government can clearly be held responsible for presiding over the start of the growth in foreign debt, which grew from 11 per cent of GDP to 21 per cent in a mere two years from June 1981 to June 1983.</PARA>
<PARA>Guess who was Treasurer? It was the now Leader of the Opposition. Mr Warby also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This rate of growth of foreign debt has only been briefly approached, and never exceeded, under the Hawke-Keating governments.</PARA>
<PARA>So writes Mr Warby, a member of the Federal Council of the Liberal Party. That is an honest exposure of the fact. What he says there is absolutely true. Economic performance was appalling and there was also a spectacular increase in foreign debt while the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this country. The whole weakness in the external account was incredibly developed in that time. So was the loss of national savings; they declined markedly whilst the opposition was in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absurd to say that we have done nothing to address the external account. Of course we have. The Prime Minister has been through the detail of that in question time and in the censure debate so I do not intend to go to the details. But, obviously, there has been an enormous improvement in the efficiency of this economy and in its international competitiveness and capacity to trade with other nations. That has been recognised by Standard and Poor's&mdash;the rating agency&mdash;in reaffirming Australia's ratings just earlier this week. If it thinks our foreign debt and current account are so bad, why did it reaffirm our ratings? I quote from its media release, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Improvements in overseas competitiveness and growth prospects have been driven by important shifts in government policy over the past decade. Tariff reductions, along with deregulation and structural reforms affecting a range of industries, have improved productivity and the functioning of the labour market. Exports are gradually diversifying and gaining market share, helped by declines in the real exchange rate in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA>So those things are recognised by the rating agencies&mdash;the most important bodies which assess the credit rating of the nation. In a sense, they are very important critics indeed. They look at those things and say, `These are very good achievements. On that basis, because these things are being done, we reaffirm the rating.' So it is not a matter of nothing being done on the external account. An enormous amount has been done on the external account. That shows that this government has not been idle and simply allowed an external problem to develop. It has been addressing that issue considerably indeed. That is not to say that there is nothing more to do. Of course there is more to do. There is more to be done about improving efficiency and improving national savings. What has been announced by me earlier this week shows that we intend to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also said by the opposition that this government has produced a more unfair distribution of income, that the poor have got poorer while the rich have got richer. I do not doubt that the rich have got richer, but it is absolute nonsense to say that the poor have got poorer. </PARA>

Single parents with two children and renting privately were nine per cent below the poverty line in 1983; they are now four per cent above it. So do not give us this rubbish about the poor getting poorer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to you concerning the existence of a blockade this week. From my point of view, the blockade has represented harassment, intimidation and a physical strain. It seems to me that it is a breach of privilege, and I ask you to investigate the matter. I would also like to ask you to initiate the formulation of clear guidelines concerning demonstrations affecting parliament, members and their electorate offices, particularly in view of the fact that in recent times we have had a number of incidents. We have had the postal strike disrupting our mail; we have had the third runway people playing a recording of aircraft noise in the early hours at members' dwellings; and now we have this blockade. Things seem to be escalating and I think the situation should be brought under control in some way.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would like the opportunity to prepare a thorough response for the members of this place, and I will undertake to do that. I might just say in passing, however, that the Joint Committee on the National Capital and External Territories is presently conducting an inquiry into the subject matter of demonstrations on national land, which encompasses this building. Might I suggest to the honourable member and any others that have an interest in that that they can perhaps make a contribution and a submission to that inquiry, which is chaired by the honourable member for Dunkley. But, as I said, I will give him and the House a fuller answer on this. That will probably be next week.</PARA></TALK.START>

People in front of them were given unescorted passes. My guests were asked whether they were associated with the protest outside.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to bring to the attention of the House the plight of people who, through no fault of their own, become victims of the Credit Reference Association and who are, in due course, refused credit for other purchases. I understand the need for the Credit Reference Association and the objective to ensure that businesses are not defrauded by loan defaulters. Notwithstanding that, I think a review of the rules covering the Credit Reference Association is required to protect genuine people who have unintentionally defaulted on a loan and, therefore, been put onto the lists of the CRAA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not asking for all people who come forward with an excuse to be taken off the list; what I am saying, though, is that many people are put on the list without a fair hearing. The first constituent I would like to talk about is Gary. Gary had a post office address in Northam, which is east of Perth. With his job Gary was sent to Albany, south of Perth, to work for about four months. His mail was collected and passed on by his sister and, in the process, a credit account of $109 was overlooked. This was promptly paid on being brought to his attention. Nevertheless, he has been listed as a defaulter in the CRAA system. I should also note that Gary has had other credit arrangements prior to this to the value of tens of thousands of dollars and these have all been met on time and cleared as per credit contractual arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The late payment of $109&mdash;and I point out that it exceeds the listing minimum of $100 by only $9&mdash;has ruined Gary's credit rating and he now has a non-credit sanction applied for a period of five years. An appeal by Gary to his creditor could not have his name removed, and I am suggesting that the CRAA should allow for this. If the creditor is happy for a debtor to be taken off the list, then so too should the CRAA be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another constituent, Sharon, is a victim of a marriage breakup. A loan was taken out during her marriage in her name only. When the marriage unfortunately broke down, her former husband undertook to pay the account. Sharon was eventually informed that she had defaulted on the loan&mdash;the loan her husband had undertaken to pay&mdash;so she promptly paid it. She paid it straightaway and without question. Because her ex-husband did not pay the loan on time, and because the loan was in Sharon's name, she is now listed as a loan defaulter and, like Gary, has a non-credit sanction of five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both these cases illustrate an unfair part of the CRAA. It is obvious that the agreements that the CRAA has with credit agencies need review to allow for names to be deleted. If the CRAA will not undertake such a review, then I call on the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) to perhaps intervene in these cases. </PARA>

I would also like to congratulate the Stirling Australia Remembers committee, chaired by Mr Jack Babbage, supported by local RSL groups, state politicians in Stirling, the City of Stirling and various other interested parties. I thank them sincerely for their time and effort in organising the Australia Remembers commemorations in Stirling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While on the subject, I know that many of the Australia Remembers committees throughout Western Australia would have valued contributions from the Australian Army Band, Perth. Regrettably, the government chose to disband the band at the beginning of this year, depriving Western Australians of its valuable services. Yet again, Western Australia is being picked on by this arrogant Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What makes this decision worse is that, while the government might argue that it was a cost cutting exercise, the Prime Minister is spending millions of dollars dolling up his aerial gin palace, otherwise known as his VIP jet. He deprives Western Australia of its military band on the one hand under the guise of saving money, but on the other hand he spends millions on his private jet so that he can get a little bit quieter sleep. Considering his Lodge purchases, there is no doubt that he is the most arrogant and selfish Prime Minister our country has ever had. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to respond to the continuously misleading statements by the opposition concerning the east-west runway at Sydney airport. On several occasions the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) has called for the reopening of the east-west runway. Again today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the opposition spokesman on aviation, Senator Warwick Parer, called for the runway's reopening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of this House and the public not living near the airport need to be told the truth. The east-west runway at Sydney airport has never been closed. The supposed closure of the east-west runway has become another great urban myth, ranking very closely with the one about giant crocodiles living in the sewers. Today, the Leader of the Opposition called for a `sharing of the pain'. Well, let me tell Mr Howard&mdash;as the residents of south-west Sydney will tell him&mdash;we have been sharing the pain for far too long already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The east-west runway at Sydney airport is and always has been operated when there were adverse weather conditions&mdash;which includes such things as cross-winds or traffic congestion restricting use of the north-south runways. The preferred runway has always been&mdash;for noise abatement reasons&mdash;the north-south runway, runway number 16, which was the old runway. This is still the case. The east-west runway has been used whenever there is a cross-wind exceeding 25 knots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years this has meant that between 30 and 40 per cent of air traffic has taken off using the east-west runway. We were told by the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation that this would be reduced to 1.2 per cent of traffic when the third runway was opened. That was part of the EIS and part of the agreement for the opening of that runway. But residents living near the airport, and members of parliament, have learnt the hard way not to place too much trust in CAA and FAC statements or predictions. These authorities, like the opposition, are not above misleading this parliament and the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While take-offs using the east-west runway have been reduced significantly since the opening of the third runway&mdash;the people living in the south-west are very thankful for this&mdash;residents know that weather conditions in recent weeks have been relatively good and that, as a result, aircraft have used optimum noise abatement procedures. I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Parer and the member for Cook go away and do their homework, take a look at the CAA radar tracking maps and see what happened when westerly winds prevailed in the week immediately following the opening of the third runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The location of Sydney airport on Botany Bay means, as residents to the south-west of the airport know too well, that air traffic is completely at the mercy of the weather conditions. A tail wind of just five knots means aircraft must take off to the north instead of over the bay. A cross-wind of 25 knots means the preferred take-off runway is the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this runway is anything but closed, and it is hard to comprehend from the repetitive gibberish that the opposition spouts precisely what it means. Surely it does not mean that it wants the reintroduction of the SIMOPS, the simultaneous operation of north and south runways. If that is the case, it is calling for the closure of the third runway, which for years they said Sydney had to have. It would be calling for a reduction in capacity and the spreading of noise to another 50,000 residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If members need to refresh their memories on the former traffic operations at Sydney airport&mdash;the procedures that the member for Cook in this House has called for a return to&mdash;they should look no further than the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 8 November last year where a photo story appeared, headed `Too Close for Comfort'. It pictured an incoming aircraft having to pull up because another aircraft using the east-west intersection was still on the runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Safety concerns aside, it would be impossible to justify returning to the old system when that would mean closure of the third runway, a reduction in capacity, and noise pollution seriously affecting an additional 50,000 residents. Residents must seriously wonder just how concerned the opposition is about protecting the interests of the community when what it is calling for would mean that another 50,000 people would be seriously affected by noise&mdash;not to mention travellers and possibly the lives of residents being put at serious risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But perhaps this is not what they intend. Perhaps they are again touting for the small aircraft operators who are worried that when capacity reaches its limit in a few months they will be forced out of Sydney airport. If that is the case, what they are proposing is not an improvement to the noise problem but an increase in noise for residents living north of the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any dummy&mdash;with the possible exception of the Mayor of Marrickville and the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;could see that shifting light aircraft off the main runways will simply allow extra capacity on the north-south runways and, therefore, more aircraft and noise over residents north and south of the airport. I think the Leader of the Opposition should come clean with his constituents and other residents around the airport and state precisely what he is proposing or is this like the rest of the Liberal policy platform&mdash;glib one-liners?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically, the Leader of the Opposition has always been a mouthpiece for the airline industry and there is no reason to think otherwise this time. He is on record as pushing the third runway cart from day one, and he has called for the cutting of the curfew. So to have the gall to say now that he is concerned about his constituents is absolutely ridiculous. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity this week in the parliament to draw to the attention of the House the desperate plight of primary producers in my electorate. My electorate is in the north-west of Victoria and takes in the famous regions of the Mallee and the Northern Wimmera. I have to say that these would have to be the most economically depressed rural regions in that state. Were it not for the terrible circumstances in Queensland and New South Wales as a result of drought, I would say they were the most depressed in the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These areas heavily rely on the profitability of the grain industry. But the last few years, with varying degrees of natural disasters on top of a decade of high interest rates instigated by the current government, have crippled many farming families. The Victorians in this particular area were bitterly disappointed at the close of last year to find that Victoria was not included in the special circumstances provisions of the drought relief. They feel particularly left out when they see so many Australians in need being provided for while their needs are being overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992-93 there was an extreme wet weather period during what was to be a bonanza harvest for the grain industry&mdash;14 million tonnes of grain grown right across Australia in record reduced areas, demonstrating the efficiency of grain growers in growing a record crop from minimal areas. The sad fact is that 54 per cent of this crop was downgraded as a result of heavy rain, resulting in losses of $17 million to the grain growers in my area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, prior to the harvest, during the vital growing period there was an unprecedented mouse plague. For those members who have never seen a mouse plague, it is a terrifying experience to have mice not only eating your crop but overrunning your house and eating electrical wiring. It is not a very kind experience to be part of. In the 1994-95 season we had a drought with the worst and lowest rainfall on record in Victoria. One of the townships in the middle of the Mallee, Sea Lake, recorded only 160 millimetres of rainfall during the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult for me to convey to the parliament the extent of the hardship, pain and economic devastation which has resulted. I normally like to speak in a positive way of the resilience and the determination of the people of my electorate. They are desperate. I call upon the government and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) in the other house to reconsider the declaration that Victoria not be given special circumstances assistance. These people are faced with crippling debt and ongoing increased costs, and their mood is one of despair and disillusionment. The dilemma they are now confronted with is how to service their current debt and how to access the capital necessary to plant their next crop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to speak on this matter because there is a perception that, because it has rained in Victoria, the problems are over. They are not. Despite strong representation from a range of interest groups last year, the federal government has chosen not to approve giving Victoria special circumstances assistance. This is despite Victoria clearly qualifying for five out of six of the criteria agreed between the joint governments across Australia. One criterion, that of meteorological circumstance, saw it not qualifying for assistance. It is not so much the absence of rain, but the absence of rain during a critical growing season that is important. The declaration that over a 36-month period we have to have a one in 20-year circumstance has put Victorian primary producers, particularly grain growers, at a substantial disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noted the willingness of the government to reconsider the sixth criterion, but I am alarmed that the reconsideration of Victoria's circumstances will not be considered until autumn. By then many of my grain growers will have gone to the wall as they face the dilemma of where to source the finance and income to plant next year's crop. I have many primary producers and families whose children do not qualify for Austudy assistance, so they face the very real and traumatic circumstance of choosing which one of their several children will not go on to tertiary education or even senior secondary education. These are dire circumstances. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The industrial relations policy of CRA has been raised in this House on a number of occasions. There is no denying that CRA is among the leaders in the push for Australia to smash the trade union movement and to return industrial relations back over 100 years. CRA is determined that the absolute power and discretion in industrial relations will go to the employer. The seventh most profitable company in the nation is attempting to take all rights from the employees and is intent in bringing in work contracts, the aims of which are to push the award safety net to the limit&mdash;contracts that will mean in the end that there will be no minimum standards for workers, no minimum standards of health and safety, and no minimum wages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CRA has an Australia-wide program which hides its policy behind a screen of secret words like `change process', `reform', `differential rewards', `conversion' and `behavioural change'. As members would be aware, behind this jargon is the reality for CRA that Big Brother knows best. It wants a world where all employees have to take what the boss wants to give them&mdash;a take it or leave it attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year it was announced that the Southern Copper smelter at Port Kembla in my electorate would close. At the moment there is a hearing before the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission in Wollongong, where CRA is blaming the Illawarra trade unions for the closure of the Southern Copper smelter plant. That is an absolute nonsense. The closure of the Southern Copper smelter plant is in many respects a tragedy for the Illawarra, which can ill afford to lose in excess of 400 jobs. These claims now being made by CRA are in stark contrast to public statements made by Southern Copper in the latter half of last year in which it announced a new era in industrial relations at Port Kembla and the potential for international competitiveness at the Port Kembla smelter following the signing of an innovative enterprise agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am convinced that the closure of the smelter at Port Kembla is part of an overall strategy by CRA to bring the trade union movement to heel. Its record throughout Australia is one of continual attacks on the trade union movement. What has happened at Port Kembla is only part of a wider scheme. Indeed, to reinforce this, late last year I convened a meeting of Labor members with CRA works in their electorates. The story from each of them was the same. The industrial relations strategy of this crowd is appalling. As far as CRA is concerned, there can be no negotiation or bargaining in the circumstances that CRA is seeking to impose upon its work force Australia-wide. CRA should be truthful to the work force at Port Kembla and to the people of the Illawarra and stop putting the blame onto the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many reasons why the smelter at Port Kembla has closed. It is a matter of debate and negotiation at the moment whether this closure is a temporary or a permanent measure. We all hope, and we are all working to ensure, that it is only a temporary measure. Not least of the reasons for the smelter being closed was the considerable amount of money&mdash;in excess of $100 million&mdash;that the company had to spend to bring the smelter to acceptable environmental standards. This Saturday, I will be attending the pollution meeting held in Port Kembla on the first Saturday of each month. Month after month, people have come along to the meetings and demonstrated what has been happening with regard to the stuff that has been spewing out of the smelter stack at Port Kembla. It is a very debatable point. The company will have to invest a lot of money there. It must look at the matter seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the reasons but there are many other reasons&mdash;not least the price of copper. It is absolute nonsense, but typical of CRA, that the whole blame for the unfortunate closure of that smelter at Port Kembla has been put on the trade union movement&mdash;a claim which I totally reject. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the House's attention to the arguments that are taking place in the confines of Parliament House in relation to logging. I wish to bring a personal perspective to this terrible government decision to close down sections of the forestry industry. With all the arguments between Senator Faulkner, the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) and members of this House, we have overlooked the human factor and the fact that a positive government decision will close down sections of the forestry industry in southern New South Wales and Victoria. Quite clearly, these people will lose their jobs next week or next month, because the logging industry is a seasonal industry; they have to complete their job in the summer period. With the minister's decision and the procrastination that has taken place, these people will not have a job and will not be able to complete their contracts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What struck me was the genuineness of these people who have been in and around Parliament House over the last four or five days. I have spoken to groups of them; I have invited two groups into my office. They could not be more genuine in their approach to the job in hand. They have made investments of up to $1 1/2 million, based on the fact that the Victorian government had given them security over a particular forest area and had said, `Look, we agree that these areas are okay; they meet all the environmental standards and you should proceed to make the investments.' They have made investments in sawmills. They have improved their technology and their value adding capacity. They have improved their trucks in order to extract the timber from the forest areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, one group told me this morning that it had doubled its capacity, that it had become more efficient and that it had made those investments. It now tells me that, if this decision is not reversed, next week that investment will be in jeopardy and those jobs will be gone. I think the House should be aware of that. The hyperbole of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) here today that the government will come up with the right decision and will find a compromise gets away from the truth. It gets away from the clear understanding of the state governments in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales, which had issued guidelines under the national forest policy statement as to where logging which would flow on to the obvious woodchipping of by-products could take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The green movement and the environmentalists have used the export powers of the federal government to interfere with these state arrangements. These very genuine people whom I have talked to indicated that the Victorian government, under both shades of political opinion&mdash;Premier Kirner and Premier Kennett&mdash;had adopted world best practice in environmental standards in arranging the way forests should be logged, and in ensuring 80-year rotations and sustainable forestry. Clear-felling arrangements are appropriate in certain areas but other felling arrangements are more appropriate in other areas. These arrangements had all been agreed to by the loggers, the governments and the department of conservation and lands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have a minister of the federal government&mdash;which, of course, always knows better&mdash;being advised by greenie groups and saying, `Look, we'll have a look at the 1,300 coupes. We'll have another look at them.' That was the first arrangement. According to greenie evaluations, their heritage value, et cetera, had already been evaluated almost year by year. Of those 1,300 coupes, the government compromised and came down to 511. Surprise, surprise&mdash;as members of this House are aware, some of these 511 coupes consisted of airstrips, quarries, pine plantations and some regrowth areas of less than 20 years, and some of these coupes did not even exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a remarkable situation we have. At a time when we need export dollars, we have a government that can make a decision about forest matters of which it has no real knowledge. The department of the environment has no real knowledge of the real issues in the forest, such as the by-products of woodchips, yet we have Minister Faulkner continuing to procrastinate when Minister Beddall has been struggling with this issue from within the government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Woodchips are an exportable commodity. They provide the viable industry of sawlogs within the Victorian timber industry and Tasmania. This one decision of Senator Faulkner and the Prime Minister will put at risk the $60 million worth of equipment owned by people who have come to Parliament House to put forward their case. It will put these people out of work and put millions of dollars worth of investment at risk, and these people will get no return on their investment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to talk about brothels. Brothels have been an institution in Kalgoorlie virtually since its establishment, and they have served a very good and useful public service. They have been highly accepted by the community. They have operated under a policy of containment, which was policed&mdash;very effectively, I think&mdash;by the police force, and it has worked for many years. It worked to the benefit of the girls working in the industry, as it gave them security and protection, and it worked to the benefit of the community because it made health checks and control of drugs much easier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The police force has now moved to abandon this policy and allow what is virtually an open slather arrangement, where prostitution will not be confined to Hay Street but will be allowed in other areas, and escort services will be provided. I think that this is a very retrograde step, and we need to ask why this has happened. The truth of the matter is this: the proprietor of a brothel at 181 Hay Street is Maryanne Kenworthy. She has extensive business interests of the same sort in Perth. Virtually since the day she purchased this property, she has flouted the containment policy that existed in Kalgoorlie, and the police force has been either unable or unwilling to enforce it. There is no doubt that she had girls living outside the street, which was in contravention of the policy, and that the girls had been attending hotels and nightclubs, which was also in contravention of the policy. Ms Kenworthy has also had many more than one girl in each room, which contravenes yet another requirement of the policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of police to enforce this situation has resulted in their moving to legitimise what they say they cannot control. One must ask the police why suddenly, after all these years, they cannot control it. Was there a lack of will in Kalgoorlie? Were they frightened of the operation at 181 Hay Street? Or were they directed from Perth? I do not believe there has ever been any corruption&mdash;certainly not of any significant nature&mdash;in this industry in Kalgoorlie. But there is a possibility that there was corruption in Perth and that the orders were fed down through the police force. Of course, there is room for some change in circumstances. I think it is a policy that must be reversed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no problem with the girls drinking in hotels or going to shows, provided they do not solicit. I think that would be an acceptable amendment. However, I think we have to look very carefully at this situation because at the moment the girls are at risk. Girls as young as 18 are now allowed to operate in the escort business or in brothels. If we allow people to be flown in for events in Kalgoorlie, the police will have no control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present system gives the community some protection because it is easier to maintain health standards and is much easier to control drugs. I believe the council is right in its opposition. I urge the council to reinforce its zoning laws to make it very difficult, or impossible, for anyone to operate a brothel outside of a designated area. The council should leave it to the state minister to override that if he dares. I call on the police force to do what it has done very successfully in the past and police the containment policy that has been so successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is very easy these days to give in to what seems to be an insurmountable problem. The establishment at 181 Hay Street has thrown into confusion a very orderly and effective system that existed in Kalgoorlie.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 is of a routine administrative nature and will incorporate excise tariff proposals Nos 2, 3 and 4 of 1994 into the Excise Tariff Act of 1921. As honourable members would be aware, excise imposes a rate of duty on commodities produced in Australia, while customs duty applies to goods imported into Australia. It is important that changes in excise and customs tariff for the same commodity are linked to ensure that the equivalent rate of duty applies to the import or domestic production of the commodity in question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In passing, I note that to do otherwise would favour the import of the commodity over its production in Australia, or vice versa. This would obviously introduce unwanted distortions into Australian markets. It is therefore a measure of the maturity of many Australian industries that they are able to compete with foreign producers without the protection for the commodity of a customs duty higher than the excise duty, so that domestic production is not subsidised over imports. The necessary linkage between changes in excise and customs duties suggests there would be some merit in assimilating the two pieces of legislation currently required. As a companion customs bill to this excise legislation has been introduced into the House, there would seem to be some merit in debating the bills cognately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to this matter, excise and customs tariffs can only be altered by legislation in this parliament, but the government has the option of introducing an excise tariff proposal or customs tariff proposal which can subsequently be included in legislation. However, when parliament is not sitting, notice of tariff changes may be made by publication in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth Gazette</EMPHASIS>, with the introduction of a tariff proposal into the House of Representatives and legislation amending the appropriate act to follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty of enacting tariff alterations when parliament is not sitting provides some justification for this rather Byzantine process, but the frequency with which tariff proposals and bills of this kind are introduced into this parliament suggests that some other process which takes up less of the parliament's time in routine matters would be very beneficial in saving taxpayers' money. Any such arrangement would necessarily require the opportunity to have adequate scrutiny and comment by the opposition. Within these constraints, I do challenge the government to initiate appropriate reforms in the efficiency with which these duty alterations are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Excise tariff proposal No. 2 of 1994 proposed a decrease in the excise duty payable on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene of 1.977c per litre, and a decrease in the excise duty payable on topped crude oil of 2.977c per litre with effect from 11 May 1994. As a result, the excise on all these fuels became 6.586c per litre. By way of explanation&mdash;for the benefit of anybody not involved in the furious negotiations between the shipping and mining industries after the government increased the excise on those products in the August 1993 budget&mdash;crude oil consists of a range of hydrocarbons of varying molecular weight, so `topped' crude oil refers to crude oil heated to remove the more volatile or lighter hydrocarbons. Since topped crude oil can be used as a substitute for fuel oil, it is important that the excise duties on the two oils are now the same. This naturally avoids the substitution of topped crude oil for fuel oil to avoid excise duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decreases in excise were announced almost one year ago in the 1994 budget. The lengthy debate before we are now scrutinising the issue in parliament would seem to provide another pertinent reason for reform of the administrative process of changing tariffs. The decrease in excise duty now under discussion by the chamber partly offsets the 3c per litre increase in excise duty in the 1993-94 budget, which produced immediate objection from the mining and shipping communities because of the savage effect of the increase on their profitability. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), who has charge of this legislation in this chamber, would be very aware of the furious representations made at the time. I know that the industries concerned regarded him as a strong advocate on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to point out that those representations from the mining and shipping industries as to the effect of the 3c increase on input costs were successful in convincing the government to reduce the excise. In the case of the mining industry, Nabalco is the major user of fuel oil in its bauxite mine and aluminium refinery at Gove in the Northern Territory. Nabalco faced an increase of its fuel oil tax bill to $30 million per year, which would place a severe constraint on Nabalco's competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the coastal shipping industry, the 1993 petroleum products excise increases had a particularly severe impact, adding almost $10 million per year in cost to the industry as a whole, or an average cost of $290,000 per vessel per year. The last round of reform measures in that industry, which saw crew levels reduced to an average of 18.5 crew per vessel, delivered savings of an average of $217,000 per vessel per year, which would have been hopelessly negated by the fuel excise increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition would like to see the government commit to reducing the absurd petrol and diesel excise for road users, this does not diminish our support for the reductions encompassed in this particular bill. It is highly appropriate and timely to debate these matters today as petrol and diesel excise rose yesterday by some 0.5c per litre in line with the government's tax by stealth policy of six-monthly increases in excise based on the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, did you know that from yesterday your constituents are paying 0.5c more per litre in petrol excise? I know you will be distressed by that, as we in the coalition parties are. Thus, motorists will be hit with increased fuel bills from today onwards, while householders can expect the cost of essential goods to rise. As usual, the price increases will be worse for rural businesses and households because of the transport costs involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While 0.5c per litre may not seem much, past increases have brought the excise from 6c per litre, when the Labor government took office in March 1983, to its staggering level of almost 35c per litre for leaded petrol. Worse, while the excise brings in nearly $10 billion per year, only eight per cent of the total fuel excise take is returned to road funding as was originally planned. Quite simply, many businesses have no option but to rely on motor transport for their livelihood and must pay any increase in price or face collapse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Households throughout Australia, particularly in rural areas, buy essential goods such as food and clothing which have been transported long distances by road and will cost more as a result of this excise increase. One only has to ask truckies or contractors what they think of the petrol and diesel fuel excise. They know they have no choice but to travel long distances to service rural communities and that those petrol excises just cascade through the whole price structure so that the ordinary household buying everyday grocery items is forced to pay more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no defence from government, and I do not believe the government will even mount a defence, because of its deficit problems, its mismanagement of the economy and its blow-out in the budget deficit. It is dependent on this business input cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to excise tariff proposal No. 3 of 1994, which proposes a decrease in the excise duty payable on aviation gasoline, known as avgas, of 6.327c per litre, and an increase in the excise duty payable on aviation kerosene, known as avtur, of 1.194c per litre. The excise variations took effect from 1 July 1994 but were announced in the 1994-95 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Avgas is the fuel used in piston driven propeller aircraft, while avtur is used in jet aircraft and turbine powered propeller aircraft. The proposed decrease in excise on avgas and avtur actually consists of an increase in the air safety regulation duty on avgas and avtur of 1.194c per litre and a decrease of 7.521c per litre in the component of the avgas excise associated with the Civil Aviation Authority's airways services. The net change in the duty on avgas is therefore a decrease of 6.327c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The airways services referred to are provided by the CAA and are funded by charges on avtur aircraft and by a portion of the avgas excise. Over recent years, the CAA has substantially reduced its expenditure on delivering these services, primarily by consolidating its operations. For instance, the efficiency measures adopted include closing the Mount Isa and Karratha control towers and withdrawing flight service functions to major centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reduction in the duty on avgas passes on some of those savings to the general aviation sector, which largely uses avgas powered aircraft. However, avtur operators have already received significant benefits from the CAA's cost reduction program, with the CAA reducing its airways charges by $90 million in the 1992-93 financial year and $109 million in the 1993-94 year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA recommended the duty decrease to the government following a revision of its cost recovery arrangements. The new duty rate is based on the principle that avgas operators should be required to cover only the direct cost of the services provided to them&mdash;a genuine user pays arrangement. Many of the CAA's expenses, such as the cost of providing air traffic services, would have to be incurred regardless of whether they were used by avgas operators. These measures will have a neutral financial impact, with the duty alterations balanced by equivalent changes in the funds appropriated to the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Excise tariff proposal No. 4 of 1994 retained excise duty on stabilised crude petroleum oil and condensate for use as a fuel other than when used as a fuel in the recovery, production, transportation or refining of stabilised crude oil or condensate. In 1993 the government legislated to end the practice of fuel substitution to avoid payment of excise as, reportedly, crude oil and condensates were being sold directly to consumers by producers as substitutes of petrol and diesel. However, in attempting to end this fuel substitution, the government inadvertently allowed crude oil and condensates used in the recovery, production, transportation and refining of crude oil or condensates to be subject to excise. This anomaly is now corrected as a result of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this seems straightforward, the amendment imposes a burden on producers in collecting small amounts of excise. I therefore seek an assurance from the government that it will balance the needs of compliance with the costs that must be borne by the producers in meeting the legal and administrative requirements of excise collection. This is a very important point, and I would wish for the parliamentary secretary addressing his mind to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention one further relevant issue involving taxation on petroleum products before concluding my remarks. In recent months it has become common knowledge&mdash;it has been confirmed in the last 48 hours by the Treasurer (Mr Willis)&mdash;that the government is considering the imposition of a carbon or energy tax to help meet its perceived commitments to reduce greenhouse gases under the United Nations framework convention on climate change. Such a tax would be levied, according to government sources, on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from an industrial process so that the price of commodities, such as petrol, coal, electricity and aluminium, would all increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While initially enormous rates of taxation were proposed, especially by the green movement, a recognition of the significant damage this would cause to industry, and the economy, has seen the proposals modified to a proposed tax of $1.25 per tonne of emitted carbon dioxide with exports exempted. That is the proposal that I am quite certain is before the government at present. All indications are that, at this time at least, the government will accept that idea of $1.25 carbon tax per tonne of emitted carbon dioxide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While seemingly modest, in effect, this tax is still fundamentally flawed for several reasons. Greenhouse gas reduction is a global problem and must be resolved at a global level. It is also fundamentally an issue of trade competitiveness. Australia must be very careful not to throw away the competitive advantage we hold in having abundant natural resources simply to appear greener than green. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a rate of $1.25 per tonne of carbon dioxide, the tax has been estimated by the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research to yield greenhouse gas savings of only three per cent off the government's target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Yet, even at this rate, the tax would have a significant and vital effect on our most important industries and consumers at large. For example, the Business Council of Australia has estimated that the tax would add 20 per cent to the cost of brown coal and 10 per cent to the cost of black coal. This, in turn, would quickly appear in increased electricity prices which inevitably impact hardest on the least well off in the community, including pensioners and the unemployed. The loss of jobs, competitiveness and investment that would result from a carbon tax would in no measure be compensated for by the $320 million revenue raised each year by this $1.25 carbon tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have argued repeatedly in this place, the key to improving Australia's greenhouse gas emission performance is to institute an effective program of energy efficiency improvements throughout the industrial, government and residential sectors. The government has completely failed in this regard, as highlighted by the Auditor-General nearly two years ago in his review of the energy management programs administered by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Increased energy efficiency will save money as well as improving greenhouse performance but the government must institute sensible educational and incentive programs and lead the way by example. The opposition supports the legislation before the House. </PARA>

It is quite reasonable that he should, as he did, use this piece of rather technical and precise legislation as a vehicle to draw the attention of the parliament and the community to other concerns which the opposition has in connection with the question of excise duties. In particular, I know he spoke at some length on the question of petrol excise and what is happening with petrol prices at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank him for the elucidation which he brought to the technical content of this legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member referred to the extensive debate that has taken place since then before this legislation came in here for a second reading debate. To my mind no such debate has taken place. I do not think the honourable member for Gippsland could draw my attention to any significant evidence of widespread debate out there in the community about these precise elements. Debate has taken place within the industry, certainly, but I will guarantee that the honourable member's electorate office was not inundated with people out there in the electorate&mdash;his constituents&mdash;saying, `When will this legislation to confirm the budget provisions for these arrangements which are already in existence and operating come through the parliament?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am keeping a file on all of the observations that the honourable member for Gippsland has made about petrol excise, the way in which it has increased, and the proportion of it which is being applied to road construction. I am keeping a file and I am going to repeat that. I am going to say that this is not my argument&mdash;if I am still in the parliament when the opposition comes into government, but I do not think I will be. Talking about us being interred at some time in the future, I do not think I will be around at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when opposition members do, they will have to decide on what basis they will make their road funding arrangements. We went through a stage in defining the road funding arrangements where we took a proportion, as you will recall, of fuel excise and we called it a road user charge. We always fixed that road user charge at a level which was just sufficient to provide the funds that we had decided we would put into road construction and road maintenance at a Commonwealth level. We would set the road user charge out of petrol excise in order to fund whatever we needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not think that that was a very sensible arrangement. It did not really serve any purpose. I suppose, in a sense, it just helped to reinforce the idea that petrol excise was being collected to fund roads. That is not the way to do it. Petrol excise, like other types of revenue, is a source of general revenue. When we get the whole bucket of funds together, we ask, `What is the relative importance of our commitment to roads? What proportion of that big bucket of revenue should go to roads?', and just allocate it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gippsland is the main opposition spokesman on this matter. I would suggest that, if he has any confidence or optimism about the prospect of the coalition in future, he will start now to move away from that position, because I have a file on those statements that he has been making from time to time. If he starts to move away from that position I will give him a guarantee. As soon as he starts to move away from that position, I ask him to draw my attention to it&mdash;if I miss it&mdash;and send me a copy of those comments so that I can add them to my file. That will help me to qualify the statements that he has been making in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the opposition says about the increase in excise&mdash;6c a litre in 1983 up to about 34c a litre at the present time&mdash;is true, but our excise imposition on petrol is still one of the lowest in the OECD. The price at which we sell petrol in Australia is one of the lowest in the OECD. Commonwealth road funding has contracted back to concentrate on the national highway system for both maintenance and construction. There has been a very significant level of commitment&mdash;and there is continuing commitment&mdash;on the part of the Commonwealth in an area which, constitutionally and traditionally, was essentially the responsibility of state governments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary has very kindly drawn to my attention the fact that the state of the roads became so bad under the Fraser government that the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Fund was introduced in order to increase the volume of funds going into the maintenance of roads. The parliamentary secretary's observation about the deplorable state of the road system in Australia, which we inherited in 1983, is spot on. The system was falling apart. It then became necessary for the Labor government, which has been in office since 1983, to make sure that the funds were found and appropriately applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill, as I suggested earlier, represents some precise and technical adjustments to the exact levels of those excise duties on the particular items that are referred to in this amendment, for the reasons that have been given. It also represents the general process of the continuous refinement of the excise provisions for a whole number of reasons and, of course, there are some specific purposes which are related to these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment is the excise tariff proposal No. 2 and, as I indicated before, these announcements were made at the time of the budget last year. They applied from 12 o'clock on budget night and they have continued to apply. All we are doing really is following the matter up and giving it the appropriate legislative base. The decreases operating under proposal No. 2 are in response to representations from industry that the increase in fuel oil has had a significant impact on input costs of certain industries, particularly export oriented mining and mineral processing operations and the coastal shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are talking about the purposes of these types of arrangements and the way in which government should apply them, an essential element would be having a government which shows itself to be responsive to industry and listens to industry. Of course, that is the reason why these particular adjustments have been introduced. Kerosene is also used as an input by certain manufacturing operations and heating oil currently competes with a range of excise free products such as natural gas. The Australian Customs Service advised the government that the excise duty on topped crude oil should be decreased and realigned with the excise duty on fuel oil. These products are similar and sometimes identical in specifications and topped crude oil can be used as a substitute for fuel oil. Previously that 1c per litre differential was resulting in that substitution effect taking place. So what we have done now is to equalise them, and I suppose that is a contribution to that level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second one is the excise tariff proposal No. 3. Those changes have been brought about as a result of the contribution of the airline industry to safety regulation, and the decrease in excise duty on avgas should be viewed in the context of the significant savings that the Civil Aviation Authority has delivered to the industry. I say in this context that the airways charges, for example, were reduced by $109 million in 1993-94 and an estimated $56 million in 1994-95 in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those reductions have been taking place. Excise duties of this kind are often used and are being used for cost recovery purposes. When there are cost adjustments, a responsive government will respond and adjust the excise, which is based on the cost. That is what this exercise is all about. Again the parliamentary secretary kindly brings to my attention the fact that in this connection the financial impact of that particular provision is neutral, which simply confirms the point that I am making. It is a cost recovery provision. Costs have reduced, excise is reduced and the overall impact is neutral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Excise tariff proposal No. 4 is directly associated with amendments contained in the Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 1993 and the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1993. Those two acts introduce measures to address revenue erosion resulting from the substitution of stabilised crude petroleum oil and condensate for other petroleum products attracting a higher rate of excise duty. It is always a question of refinement: increasing the extent to which governments respond to the purposes for which the duties are imposed and the way in which those duties at any particular level are impacting on the people who are most affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence is there that the government has been responding to industry submission, which indicates that those types of approaches&mdash;quite legitimate and, to my mind, necessary approaches&mdash;have been more than adequately followed by the government. I quote briefly from the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech. When referring to excise tariff proposal No. 3, he said that the per litre increase is a continuation of the phase-in arrangements for cost recovery with respect to air safety regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority. That emphasis on cost recovery is apparent in the parliamentary secretary's comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that the announcements were first made in the budget of last year. In the budget speech the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excise on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene will be reduced by almost 2c per litre from tonight.</PARA>
<PARA>It was, and it applied from then, and we are just giving legislative effect to those budget announcements, which have operated since then. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduction in fuel oil excise will provide significant benefits to coastal shipping and export oriented mineral projects.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, to a large extent those adjustments were made as a result of representations that were made by those industries. That statement was filled out in Budget Paper No. 1 in these terms, which I quote for precision:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs and excise rates on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene will decrease by 1.9777 cents per litre to 6.586 cents per litre from midnight on 10 May 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That was the night on which the budget was delivered, as I have indicated. The paragraph continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This adjustment will better align the increase in excise on these products with the increase in excise on unleaded petrol arising from the 1993-94 Budget measures. To provide greater consistency in the tax treatment of substitutable fuel products, customs and excise rates on topped crude for use otherwise than as a refinery feedstock will decrease by 2.9777 cents per litre to 6.586 cents per litre from midnight on 10 May 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>So there has been a realignment of those excise duties available to make sure that there is no artificial substitution effect, which is inherent in differential excises which relate to products which can be substituted one for another. It has been apparent that the excise on petroleum products, including those with which this legislation is essentially concerned, is imposed at a fixed rate per litre of the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Excise and customs are important in the whole area of government policy making, not just in a revenue sense, because in that area it is becoming relatively less and less important in each of the excises except the more traditional ones&mdash;on petrol, on tobacco and on alcohol. Even in those areas it is not just a revenue consideration; there are important social, health and general government policy considerations as well. An appropriate price for petrol helps to ensure the conservation of a finite reserve and its more efficient use; the imposition of excise on tobacco and alcohol, hopefully, assists in reducing the consumption of both of them. Governments have to refine all of these areas from time to time, and we do so, in order to achieve the general objectives of government policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) has outlined very well the effect of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) and made some general points. The coalition is supporting the bill. Perhaps I should just touch on a couple of points that the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about the OECD levels of excise we must remember that Australia is unique. Australia has this vast land mass and any impact that fuel excise has on our regional economy, particularly, can have quite significant effects. The honourable member for Gippsland touched on that cascading effect, which I think is too often ignored. It is too typical of the centralism of Canberra governments, and particularly this Canberra Labor government, that it ignores the needs of regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly interested in comments by the honourable member for Charlton about the fact that excise really is not about collecting money for roads; it is about collecting revenue. I think that is a very honest presentation of the facts&mdash;it is not about collecting money for roads, it is just another form of taxation. But, in that honesty, the honourable member informs all of Australia that the government has ignored the effect particularly on the domestic regional economy. I have already made the point that Australia has a large landmass and this cascading effect of excise has an overwhelming impact. I remember that one of the first acts of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when he was Treasurer, was to abolish the fuel equalisation program. There was an ethic in this country that fuel prices should be almost the same whether you lived in a metropolitan or a regional area. In one sweep of the pen, in about 1983-84, the then Treasurer abolished that mechanism. I think that indicates the convenience that from then on the government found in collecting general revenue from excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer back to the comments made by the two previous speakers that it was 6c added when Labor came in and now it is 34c. Somewhere in that period, I think towards the late 1980s, we had also an IPP&mdash;import parity pricing&mdash;mechanism. I remember all the comments then about world competitiveness, how exporters in particular had to be competitive, and how if the price of crude went up we would expect to pay through the IPP and if the price of crude went down we might pay through the IPP. But it did not happen like that. What happened was that when the price of crude collapsed on the world market we said, `We cannot do without the revenue,' which the honourable member acknowledged, and we transferred across to excise. I think that is the danger we run into when we talk about excise as a simple general revenue raiser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at excise in some detail, I will give the South Australian experience. There we have the federal tax of currently 34c on leaded. If you live in the city or within 50 kilometres of Adelaide, you pay another 9c, which brings you out at 41c for tax collections, federal and state, on a litre of fuel. The RAA, the automobile association of that state, has produced some figures. It makes the comment that the excise that is charged on this commodity is something like four times the luxury tax rate. I keep reiterating the point that Australia is unique. The Europeans may do things in a particular way; somebody else may do them in a particular way. But the fact that fuel is a convenient tax raiser does not necessarily mean that fuel excise reflects the best interests of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another little technique that the government tried on&mdash;it did not get away with it on this whole fuel business&mdash;back in 1993 was a diesel fuel levy, a $10 million fee for administering the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Thanks to the vigilance of the Senate, it was found to be unconstitutional. The minister, Senator Schacht, was embarrassed to find that it was actually unconstitutional. These are the sorts of habits that governments get into. They get into this convenient habit of collecting revenue&mdash;I suppose I could go on at some length about the expenditure and the priorities of government&mdash;and the convenient mechanism of excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the coalition is supporting the amendments outlined in the bill we are debating this morning and we welcome the modest decreases. But I would make a point about the decreases, in relation to fuel oil in particular, which affect the mining and shipping industries, et cetera: why in the blazes did we have the increase in the first place if we were fair dinkum about assessing world competitiveness? The member for Charlton would have us believe that we listened to people in industry, we went back to them, we talked to them and reduced the amount. Why in the blazes did the government not talk to them before it actually raised the amounts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is the issue. If there was an ongoing consultative process with industry, understanding the true competitive requirement for export industry, the government would have consulted before it raised the amount, collected the revenue and then at 10 minutes past midnight said, `Oh, that was a bit high; that was a bit rough.' As I recall it, it wiped out in one hit the benefits of some of the efficiencies that the shipping industry had been trying to make. When the industry came and said, `This is what you have done,' the government said, `Oh, sorry, we need to alter that. We realise now that we have cut across your efforts to improve your industry.' Why would the government not consult first and have a look at it. Then, if there was a capacity to pay, maybe there would be some case. But, no, it raises the amount and then it drops it. That is the criticism I have to make this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent weeks I have done some work on the question of the carbon tax. Obviously, it has been a point of general interest. In my own electorate, a report done by a reputable international group stated that, if the CO(2) levels were to be brought back to 1990 levels by the year 2000, and if charges were put on the various industries in such a fashion as to achieve this&mdash;that is, by the Rio type arrangements&mdash;the steel industry would be wiped out and huge damage done to the alumina industry. In my own electorate, where we rely very much on brown coal fired power stations, problems would certainly be created for that particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the government sincerely and genuinely: please have in mind the effect that your carbon tax proposals have on regional Australia. This government is merely raising taxation as a matter of convenience to satisfy the moment. I have been a critic in this area for many years, both in this place and, in particular, outside. During the Fraser government period, the import parity pricing time, when fuel prices increased, I was advocating that we should look at alternative energy. Surely we should be looking at more efficient methods of using our energy? But the government&mdash;as it has illustrated by transferring the import parity pricing system across to excise in the late 1980s&mdash;cannot bring itself to provide sufficient incentives to give us an opportunity to develop alternative energies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, belatedly, we are doing something about ethanol. I welcome this and I hope that it works. But we can go so much further in this country. There is a whole range of things in this greenhouse debate and we have only touched the tip of the iceberg. We should have been at it 10, 15 and 20 years ago, because we had the capacity to do it. All it takes is a little bit of vision, planning and forethought, rather than acting on a spur of the moment situation and saying, `We have got to have some money, okay, we will raise excise, or we will put on a carbon tax.' That is my criticism in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But my overriding criticism&mdash;I hope the theme comes through consistently&mdash;is the impact on regional Australia. Nowhere else but in regional Australia do you have the strongest impact of this excise. It impacts on every part of our lives. We have to use our vehicles. We do not have access to subsidised urban transport. The excise impacts upon everything: our food, entertainment, social life and cultural life. I have repeatedly pleaded with governments to consider this. It is too easy just to regard excise as a general revenue raiser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment about roads. As the member for Gippsland said, we are down to about eight per cent  in spending on roads. I take the point that we cannot expect to have to spend $10 billion&mdash;which is the amount currently collected on roads in this country&mdash;but I can say that another two or three hundred million, on top of the $860 million that we currently spend, certainly would be most welcome in much of Australia, and particularly in regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the bicentenary project is concerned, this was a priority of the Fraser government, which recognised that roads are important to regional people, and that the infrastructure of our country is very important, as is the ability to have our commerce flow efficiently and with minimum damage. The roads are a lot better than they were 50 years ago, or even 20 years ago, and part of the reason that they are better is the bicentenary program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, if the member for Charlton were here, I would remind him about the black spot program, which was a good initiative of the Labor government. I understand that the black spot program has been abolished. Of course, we will reintroduce it. It is a recognition that, whilst you are not going to spend all of that $10 billion on roads, there is plenty of room for improvement in our road system, and we need to be more generous in the way we allocate our excise to the roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Charlton talked about rural myths. I stress that it is no myth that everything is more expensive in the bush because of the excise; I stress that there is a lack of equity in this country. We used to pride ourselves on our egalitarianism. When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was Treasurer, he had the capacity to wipe out with one blow the principle that fuel prices in regional Australia should not differ significantly from metropolitan prices. We do not respect that any more. We have made excise a convenient revenue raiser and in many cases it covers the mistakes of government in general policy. I criticise the general concept of excise being a revenue raiser. I feel very strongly about it, having had the brunt of it for 20 years under successive governments. The coalition supports the modest changes that are in place today. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also acknowledged that the money raised was never intended to be directly related to what is spent on roads. We know that not even 10 per cent of the $10 billion-odd that is collected in excise and duty and the like is spent back on our roads. That is a line that the opposition has continually run. It is the line the shadow minister for resources and energy, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who addressed the Main Committee this morning, and the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), have continually run. It will be good to see the honourable member for Charlton on the opposition benches reminding us of some of the debates and the comments that have been made by the frontbenchers on this side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that it was admitted this morning that the excise collected from fuel is collected for general revenue. It is not associated with roads and the government uses it as a drip, as a direct line from the bowser straight into the Treasury coffers for general revenue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill gives effect to excise tariff proposals 2, 3 and 4 of 1994. The major amendments are: a decrease in excise duty payable on topped crude oil by 2.977c per litre to 6.586c  per litre; and a decrease in excise duty on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene by 1.977c per litre to 6.586c per litre. The measures will end an anomaly applying to excise on crude oil and condensate used in the production of crude oil and condensate, reduce the rate of excise payable on aviation gasoline by 6.327c per litre and increase the excise on aviation kerosene by 1.94c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excise tariff proposal No. 2 of 1994 proposes a decrease in the excise duty payable on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene, and a decrease in the excise duty payable on topped crude oil. These decreases were announced in the 1994 budget. The 1c per litre increase of August 1994 will not apply to topped crude oil. The decreases in excise duty on these products partly offset the 3c per litre increase in excise duty in the 1993-94 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representations from the mining and shipping industries as to the effect of the 3c per litre increase on input costs were successful in convincing the government to reduce the excise. Topped crude oil can be used as a substitute for fuel oil and the excise duties on the two oils will now be the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mining industry is of vital importance to this economy today. With our atrocious overseas debt and our atrocious balance of payments figures we must look at our mining industries, our rural industries and our forestry industries to try to get this nation out of the problem that it is in. The majority of members on the government benches acknowledge that but they are not game to speak up too much, and we have not seen too much from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the 1993 petroleum excise increases, the major user of fuel oil in the mining industry, Nabalco, operating a bauxite mine and alumina refinery at Gove, faced an increase of its fuel oil tax bill to $30 million per year. This placed a severe burden on Nabalco's competitiveness. This is in a day and age when the government is introducing a lot of reforms. It is clearing the decks, getting ready for the World Trade Organisation to take over from the GATT agreement on 1 July this year. It is trying to get our industries as world competitive as possible, yet we are hitting them with these taxes that are really inhibiting their competitiveness on the world stage. So the government has eliminated that measure that was adopted in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993 petroleum products excise increases had a particularly severe impact on the coastal shipping and mining industries, adding $9.6 million per year in cost to the shipping industry, or an average cost of $288,000 per vessel per year. This is at a time when the government's asset sale campaign was just beginning. Those asset sale committees in the Department of Finance were looking at selling ANL. On the other hand, the government is making them less competitive, less profitable. The last round of reform measures, which saw crew levels reduced to an average of 18.5 crew per vessel, delivered savings of an average of $217,000 per vessel per year, which were more than negated by the fuel excise increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition moved amendments in the Senate which would have removed the excise increase from rail and shipping. There was considerable confusion in the vote, and Senator Margetts eventually abstained from voting, despite earlier undertakings of support from the Western Australian Greens. The coalition got considerable support from producers, transport users and the shipping and rail industries for its position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shipping industry has lobbied the government intensively. It has been able to demonstrate that increases such as those imposed&mdash;and they represented, in their original form, a 92 per cent increase in excise rates for that industry&mdash;were insupportable. The government has now come back and made amends for the tax increases that they put into place in 1993. And some time during the next 12 months the people of Australia will get the opportunity to pass judgment on a lot of the actions that this government has taken. </PARA>

Obviously it would have been preferable for the increased excise to have been removed entirely, but the reduction is a good result worth $6.35 million per annum to shipowners. The Government clearly recognises the importance of cost-effective sea transport to Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA>It did not recognise that when it introduced the thing in the first place! The proposed reductions have been received less favourably by the opposition. In a media release on 10 May 1994, the shadow minister for transport said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it will be of some comfort to the shipping industry that the Government has finally admitted that its imposition of fuel tax increases in the last Budget was wrong and unfair, the reduction of the excise for fuel oil in this Budget by two cents per litre still leaves the industry with costs of $96,000 per vessel per year that were wantonly imposed after the industry had struggled hard for reform gains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduction represents a cut of operating costs of $196,000 per vessel per year&mdash;but nevertheless leaves the industry with having almost half of its $217,000 per vessel per year reform gains eliminated by imposed taxes.</PARA>

We are an island continent in the Southern Hemisphere, away from the rest of the world and from the people that we trade with. We have vast distances within Australia where we have to transport domestically produced goods, produce from our farms, mines and forests.

I have made representations to the Assistant Treasurer and to Dr Cousins, asking them to explain what criteria they used and on what basis they have increased these costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great disparity between the retail price of fuel on the mid-north coast of New South Wales and that in Sydney.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue before us today is one that was raised in the budget but, furthermore, it is a situation of this government yet again having to reverse policy because it got it wrong the first time. There has never been a more appropriate time to draw that circumstance to the attention of this chamber than at this very moment when the government is under siege from without and from within in terms of its stop-go policies on forest products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major aim of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) throughout his career has been to find the populist solution. He has no compunction about putting our children into massive debt to buy votes, be they from the arts community, the welfare community, or anybody else. As we well know, he has increased this parliament's debt from $15 billion to $100 billion. The documents on the budget show that his government's expenditure on public debt interest is fast approaching its expenditure on education for the very children who must pay off those debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look further into that budget, according to the government's own predictions for 1997-98 it proposes to spend in round figures $10 billion on defence, $10 billion on education and $10 billion on public debt interest. That has been the way the business has been run. That is the reason why we were informed yesterday by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) that our current account deficit for this financial year will reach the staggering amount of $26 billion. We just had a record amount for the month of December of $2.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this is evidenced in this legislation. There was a totally dishonest election campaign with a promise of l-a-w tax reduction. The government is now desperate to find its way through while not breaking that promise. It is looking very closely for an area in which it can raise some money to which, at least in technical terms, it did not make some specific reference during the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lo and behold, it got onto the old milking cow which the Prime Minister, in his days in opposition, attacked roundly when he referred to the petrol pump as becoming the tax office of Australia. He was the one who used those words and I supported his remarks at the time. The Labor Party came in and holus-bolus threw increases in fuel excise at the people of Australia without any reasonable assessment of what the effects might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and his brother, the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), have been at the forefront in this parliament arguing the case for cabotage and arguing the case for shipping involved in our coastal services to be Australian owned. One of the effects of this tax grab was to practically put shipping out of existence, to destroy all the gains the industry had achieved by changing manning levels and trying to become efficient, remembering that the downside of any inefficient transport sector has effect across the economic board. We cannot have inefficient transport and think it affects only the workers or the investors in that industry. It dominoes through our entire industrial and economic structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was the brother of the member for Newcastle who, when he was minister for transport, once informed the House that $1 in every $7 spent by Australians at that time was spent on transport&mdash;it may have varied somewhat since. When we throw a tax grab into transport the downside effect hits tourism, agriculture and everybody else. We saw the example recently of grain being imported at grave risk to our own industries in terms of contamination or disease. That grain was imported from the North American continent because the freight charges were cheaper from that great distance than from my state of Western Australia where we have a reasonable system. I had farmers in my electorate prepared to give grain to struggling drought affected farmers in the eastern states and the economics of getting it there destroyed the value of the gift&mdash;a pretty silly situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the government is trying to patch up another one of its mistakes. I draw the committee's attention again to the forest industry as a comparative mistake. The Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) made a decision, and I presume he made it on the best of professional environmental advice. I underline the word `professional' because we now find that money was given to people who did not even have surnames, let alone letters behind their names, which would have been a bit of a help. Just imagine it, $140,000 to Natalie and friends! I must meet Natalie. She must have some powers of persuasion. It is unbelievable!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are doing the same thing today through legislation patching up. It is all comparable. It is another example of how this government flies in without any thought, without any decent proposals, grabs some money and then finds out it has damaged significant parts of the industry. We are back here today removing some of that burden that the government placed upon the shipping industry, the aviation industry and, more particularly and broadly, the transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But not only is it too little too late; it is too little. By the government's own policy yesterday, overall fuel excise went up  1/2c on its CPI proposal. On previous occasions I have drawn to the attention of the parliament the fact that this is a very silly situation because it is self-generating. I have just given evidence of how important transport is in terms of the CPI. If we inject an additional tax burden into transport by way of an adjustment of excise, the value and cost of transport increases. That goes straight into the CPI and guarantees another tax grab. That sounds ridiculous to me, particularly when the people who pay the price are the people who are trying to keep this country out of debt by producing goods that will compete with import competitors or even by going out and exporting on our behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take the case of the people who try to produce orange juice along the Murray River, in competition with people in Brazil. The Brazilians, of course, deliver to our two great markets of Melbourne and Sydney by international shipping. There is none of this fancy excise on that. International shipping buys its fuel and labour in the best markets, and is recognised as the cheapest form of transport per kilometre in the world. The Brazilians who grow orange juice get right to the front door of Melbourne and Sydney without any of those sorts of tax burdens. By comparison, our Australian producers on the Murray River&mdash;according to documentation that has been supported by the Treasury&mdash;have to pay a tax burden of $2,000 per semitrailer per week, in either these excises that we are dealing with today or the other taxes applicable to road transport, including, of course, sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is the situation we create for our own people. We say, `Go out and multiply, and borrow money,'&mdash;at what are now very uncertain interest rates because the Prime Minister is up to his old tricks of blowing the economy apart. He just does not seem to understand. I think that is the greatest problem we have: he does not understand. Having blown the economy apart, the government encourages these people to go out and invest for Australia. It was boasting yesterday of 24 per cent investment growth and criticising us because we said the country could not sustain 14 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation has not changed. The country clearly cannot sustain 14 per cent business investment growth, because we have gone to a $26 billion foreign account deficit. In other words, we could not finance that level of growth within our own economy. That was the criticism levelled at the government, and not that it could not achieve some level: you could probably achieve 50 per cent, if the government would let you borrow enough money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the point that in this case we are telling people to invest and to develop the Australian economy; yet, through this process of excise, we load them up with financial burdens and then let their foreign competitors into the same market for nothing. I am not one who says that we should load up foreign competitors with excise or tariff burdens but, if we are going to have that so-called level playing field, I think we should not be putting onto our own people tax burdens that our overseas competitors do not pay. That is what this situation is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the speaker who opened the case for the coalition, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), expressed continuing concern, in this same context, about the proposed carbon tax&mdash;which, of course, will just be another excise. If I can just take honourable members through the background of the carbon tax, it comes back to international conventions. A lady who has just retired from this parliament, who was minister at the time, Mrs Kelly, went rushing off to the glare of spotlights of Rio and, surrounded by greenery, stood up on the platform and with a flourish signed a foreign convention committing Australia to clean air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing wrong with that except that the lady did not bother to read the fine print: she was too busy getting out there and gaining the publicity. The fine print says that countries will agree to bring back their emissions to 1990 levels, on a per capita basis. When we consider the size of Australia and the breezes that blow across us, we happen to have only 17.7 million people sitting over a huge land mass, with the same population, or a little less, than Taiwan&mdash;which is, by physical comparison, a postage stamp. But apparently we will now both be restricted to the same level of emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, energy consumption is also taxed by this excise arrangement. Energy consumption in Australia, I think, is around 215 or 250 kilojoules or whatever the measure is these days, compared&mdash;and the numbers are relevant&mdash;with something like 14 per capita in Indonesia and I think a similar figure in China. They can catch up to our 250, and we are going to have a carbon tax. We are going to say to business, `Stay in Australia; employ Australian workers and pay a carbon tax. But, of course, if you bother to transfer your business interests to Indonesia, there will be no carbon tax.' There are 120 million people in Indonesia compared with Australia's 17 million and they can consequently emit substantially more quantities of emission gases under the deal we have done with the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When ministers go over to conferences to sign these conventions, they leave their brains at home. Quite clearly, the application of a carbon tax or an extension of fuel excise is not in Australia's interests as an international competitor. Everything is against it&mdash;including huge distances compared with very small distances amongst our Asian competitors. The Prime Minister came back strutting his stuff and telling us what a wonderful deal he had done in Bogor&mdash;or wherever it was&mdash;on APEC. Basically, I support that principle, but I did have a question I would have liked to have asked him if he came to the parliament a little more frequently. That was: in the context of 2001 or 2010, does he expect Australia to change the Asian work ethic and the Asian economic approach or does he expect the reverse to apply. In other words, is Asia going to change us or are we going to change Asia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Deputy Speaker knows, I get to the races occasionally and I would like to be running the book on that. This is the simple fact. This Prime Minister does not think about what he is doing and this legislation today is evidence of that. `Grab some money,' he told John Dawkins. Of course, John left the parliament having been fed up with taking the Prime Minister's advice and then having the Prime Minister leave him to take the blame and all the flak for the electoral dishonesty&mdash;the removal of l-a-w tax cuts. John thought he had had enough of that. He had reached the peak of his career but he did not like to have to take all that sort of burden. I thought John might have gone back into advising people on tax law, to tell you the truth, but I do not think he is; he is going to try to produce wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple facts of it are that this Prime Minister does it all the time: no proper thought, be it with forestry or the application of fuel excise, and, of course, no sensible redistribution even of that tax to infrastructure. And here we go. In my state, the state government has just had to ask for an extra 4c per litre from the people of Western Australia and that is after having put $50 on every vehicle licence in that state. But that was for a different reason. That was not the meanness of the federal government; that was to re-collect the money that Robert Holmes a Court picked up on his insurance policy of a regular donation to the Labor Party over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that Western Australians pay $50 per vehicle licence per year because Robert Holmes a Court walked into the then state Labor government and convinced it, through the State Government Insurance Commission, to use $850 million of the public's resources to buy assets that were unsaleable at that time and upon which $450 million was lost. But Holmes a Court had been a regular donor to the Labor Party; it was time to call up his creditors and they responded overnight. In fact, it is amazing when we read the papers to see how frequently John Holland Constructions, now the property of Mrs Holmes a Court, gets government contracts, particularly here and overseas. I see she got another one the other day. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come back to the specifics. This legislation has been introduced by the government to correct a mistake.

These sorts of issues should have been thought through, just as the forestry industry issue should have been thought through before this government opened its mouth. </PARA>

He seems to have dissatisfied both of those groups, which is not surprising considering, as I said, he went and took advice from people who do not have surnames, let alone the sorts of qualifications and experience that one would expect them to have when deciding such a serious issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Each of the speakers I have listened to in this debate has talked about international competitiveness. The minister, when proposing these amendments, spoke about international competitiveness. I have based my remarks today on international competitiveness. We are, allegedly, reducing the costs to business by reducing these charges and that will help to make these businesses more internationally competitive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing the point of international competitiveness, I say in this place, and I have said this on numerous occasions almost everywhere I have had the opportunity to speak, that it is about time that we in this country understood the nature of our non-competitiveness. Every four years, in recent Australian history, mining growth has been 25 per cent and agricultural growth has hovered around 15 per cent. In the last four years mining growth has shrunk from 25 per cent to 3.6 per cent and farming growth has shrunk from 13 per cent&mdash;arguably, 15 per cent&mdash;to 1.9 per cent. So the juggernauts, the locomotives of the Australian economy, are stopping dead in their tracks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems in mining, which centre around land rights, greenies and those sorts of things, are not the subject of this debate, but the agricultural issues most certainly are. The cost of fuel is one of the four major cost input items for farmers. Ninety-three per cent of this nation's income comes from primary production and mining. Wherever I go I carry the list of our export earning items for anyone who wants to see it. The remarks made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that this country is now a manufacturing country are deceitful in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Prime Minister is quoting different figures, he is obviously interpreting such enterprises as meatworks as being an industrial undertaking rather than a primary production, which is quite valid in one sense, but if the agricultural sector is not growing then most certainly the processing side of the agricultural sector will be dying as well. That is the more relevant statistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking about our non-competitiveness, I point out that the first of the five major cost items for agriculture in order of priority&mdash;and that tells a story&mdash;is interest rates. Interest rates for our farmers are around 12.5 per cent at the moment. Our biggest competitor is the United States, where interest rates are half of that, at six per cent. Our second cost item is labour, and the last figures I saw were $4 per hour labour costs in the United States while in Australia our labour costs are $8 an hour. I am corrected because the most recent industrial award in Queensland puts them up to $11.50, I am told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, the cost input item in Queensland which is third in order of priority and size is water. This may not be true for other states. The cost of water in California, the biggest agricultural producing state in the United States, is $3.90. In Queensland it is $30, nearly 1,000 per cent difference. With regard to fertilisers, in the United States, urea was $203 a tonne the last time I looked, and in Australia it is $396 a tonne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most relevant statistic in this debate is fuel costs. I carry with me wherever I go&mdash;for anyone who wants to see it&mdash;a copy of the 1982 speech in the Opera House before the election of the Labor government when the quite unequivocal promise was made that the government would restrain inflation by reducing the price of petrol in Australia by 2c a litre. Since this government has been in power and that promise was made, the take by the federal government went from 22.7c per litre up to 31.8c per litre in 1991. I imagine that another 3c would have been added to that by now, which would bring it to 34c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So instead of reducing the price of oil by 2c per litre the Prime Minister has increased the price by 12c per litre. I therefore back up the remarks of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) who reminded us that the present Prime Minister coined the famous phrase that the then government was turning every petrol bowser attendant into a tax collector. Mr Keating has, in fact, done that very thing in a magnificent manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a debate about the cost of oil in Australia in its various forms, I cannot but point out that, in a country where distance counts for so much, not only has this government increased our cost structure by imposing this huge discriminatory tax on fuel but also, even more reprehensibly, it has allowed the oil companies to increase their take. One must remember that at the same time the world price of oil has dropped clean in half the price the Australian oil companies charge the retailers for oil has doubled. So whilst the cost of purchasing the oil has halved, the price they are selling it at has doubled. In that time frame, there has been one small upgrading of one refinery in Queensland, and that has been the only capital outlay by the oil companies in Australia in the last decade. Their productivity cost increases have been virtually nil. All of them have cut back on the number of employees and yet they have doubled their take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This a lot of money that we are talking about here. Their take in 1983 was 12.8c per litre and their take in 1993 was 23.4c per litre. Also, they picked up another 10.2c per litre because of the reduction in the world price. This gave them a whacking 20.8c per litre which they are not entitled to. They are not entitled to one single cent. Twenty cents per litre translates into $5.7 billion per year which they are creaming off from the Australian public and to which they are not entitled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I regard the tax impositions of the federal government as reprehensible in the extreme for increasing our cost structures in Australia, I also have to make the point that even more reprehensible has been the government's failure to act against the oil companies of Australia, which have taken profits which are unconscionable. Not only are they unconscionable but they make us, internationally, non-competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the biggest monthly current account deficit in Australian history was announced. One would think that, because every month now $2 billion more goes out of this country than comes into this country, it is a problem that needs addressing. The ramifications of it are very serious. The year before last, interest on the federal government debt was $3.9 billion and the year after next the interest will be $9.1 billion. That is a huge leap and a huge cost imposition upon the Australian public. But it is going to get a lot worse because if you are trading at a loss of $2 billion a month then your debt is skyrocketing and feeding upon itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy instituted by `Placido Domingo', our wonderful and glorious leader, for the control of the current account deficit, is to create a recession. His famous remark that `This is the recession we had to have' was a clear-cut statement of his approach to the economy. It staggers me that such a woefully ignorant economic statement can be made in this place, particularly given the scrutiny of the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media has lauded the government. Also, a lot of my political supporters have said to me, `You must admit that they have controlled inflation'. I agree with them that this is the greatest drop in inflation in Australian history. `Placido Domingo' has achieved the greatest restraint on inflation and decrease in the consumer price index in Australian history. In fact, there has only been one other period in Australian history when inflation has been restrained along these lines. That point in our history was 1930&mdash;the Depression. The opposite of inflation is depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What you see in Australia today is an horrific depression which has cost 1.5 million Australians their jobs and has cost 800,000 small businessmen and farmers their businesses.

Mind you, at times I do not know whether he has very much competition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend John Langmore for his very excellent book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Work for All</EMPHASIS>, where he reiterates exactly the same theme, that the most important function of government is to enable people to have a sense of pride, a place of work, a value in the community and income to look after their families. When that does not occur we have a situation such as in Australia today, where we have the highest juvenile suicide rate in the entire world. In Queensland we recorded in one year what has to be the highest increase in juvenile crime in the world&mdash;a 30 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the price that is being paid out there for the heartbreak of a nation, where one in three kids cannot get a job and where nearly a million Australian business families have gone broke.

They will work for the rest of their lives to repay it, if they ever make any money. The bank will foreclose on them and try to get back its money, which has been increasing because interest has been applied to that debt which has not been repaid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me be very specific. Not only has the Prime Minister said that this is the recession that we had to have, but the figures clearly indicate that he is correct. Unemployment rose from six per cent in 1986 to 11.3 per cent in 1992-93. Bankruptcies rose from about 6,000 in 1986 to 16,000 in the early 1990s. That was the cost that we paid for restraining the current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here today we are making a very small effort&mdash;but I praise the government for at least making some effort, however small and insignificant it might be&mdash;to restrain the costs of production. I go back to the figures that the economy depends upon in mining and agriculture. Agriculture cannot compete where its cost structures are between 50 and 1,000 per cent higher than those of our nearest competitor. I am talking about cost structures; I am not addressing the subsidies. I know that in wheat the European subsidy is about 100 per cent and in sugar it is 193 per cent. So two of our seven biggest export items are competing against subsidies of between 100 and 193 per cent. That does not encompass the fact of the difference in cost structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of those cost structures, the cost of money&mdash;interest rates&mdash;is set by the government. Let there be no doubt about that. It is something that the Prime Minister has said on numerous</PARA>
<PARA>occasions and that the Reserve Bank has skited about on numerous occasions. It is true, they control interest rates. The cost of money is controlled by the government. The cost of labour in Australia, which I am proud is very, very high, is also a cost set by government. The farmer cannot do anything about it. The third cost, the cost of water, is a cost set by government. The farmer cannot do anything to control the price of the water that he gets. So we have government imposed cost structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Half of the price of petrol goes to the government, so the government controls half of the price, because it has not moved against the oil companies. We are being taken to the cleaners to the tune of $6,000 million a year by the oil companies. Those figures I quoted are from the breakdown of the costs and prices in the oil industry from 1982 to 1992, by the Australian Institute of Petroleum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on the issue of the decrease in these price structures, I want to address very specifically the issue we are talking about here&mdash;the cost of running the aviation industry in Australia. We people representing country electorates are told that we must accept the principle of user pays and the great philosophy which has become known as the level playing field. One of the great elements and pillars that prop up the structure and the philosophy of the level playing field is the concept of user pays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that translates to is that Brisbane gets an international airport, costing some $600 to $700 million, to service overseas people or Australians that want to leave Australia. Brisbane gets a $700 million golden handshake. Mount Isa, which produces $1,200 million of revenue every single year for Australia&mdash;and is suffering greatly because it is not running at a profit, and has not been for some years&mdash;loses just about everything that one saw when one went to the airport. The fire brigade tender has been removed, which is very dangerous, of course; it would be nearly seven miles to town and the nearest fire brigade, should there be any problems out there. The control tower has been removed completely. All of the staff have been removed from there. The maintenance gang which was responsible for servicing the airstrip has been removed. The Qantas services to Mount Isa&mdash;Qantas being a government owned instrumentality&mdash;have been removed from Mount Isa totally; half of its services have gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the level playing field means a $700 million golden handshake for Brisbane, the international tourists and people who want to leave Australia and have enough money to go cavorting around the world. But the poor old worker in Mount Isa finds himself in grave danger every time he tries to land at the airport in Mount Isa, or uses what is left of the air services that go into Mount Isa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitution is very clear-cut on this. Aviation is a function of the federal government, not of the state government or of local governments. I fought tenaciously to have my own cabinet, during the some six years I was in it, say to the federal government, `We will refuse to take over a single, solitary airstrip. The constitution enables us to refuse to take them over. Let any death that occurs on an airstrip in Australia be upon your head.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our airstrips are falling to pieces, as our little communities cannot bring in their rates because of the collapse of the rural communities.

They were the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) and the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who have addressed the issues on what is a narrow, technical tax bill. But we have allowed a wide-ranging debate, and have discussed a whole range of issues, covering virtually every activity of federal, state and local government. The fact is that this bill proposes a reduction in tax, in the case of the excise tariff proposal No. 2 by some $25 million per year.

The only way in which we can change the methodology of raising funds to support government expenditure is through the authority of the constitution. To vary that methodology or process, one needs to change the constitution. I simply respond to his challenge to me of this morning by suggesting to him that we do not intend, at this stage, to put to the people an amendment to change the constitution with respect to the tax-raising powers of this parliament. Indeed, these amendments go to the Excise Tariff Act of 1921&mdash;of 74 years ago.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is almost sad, in a way, to have the opportunity to speak to this important paper on Australian investment in South-East Asia, dealing with Australia's trade potential in Asia, at a time when we are witnessing in this great country such devastating economic reports on what is wrong with the management of this country. It is hard to focus on Australia's potential, to keep up morale, to encourage Australian people to invest and to take risks domestically, and to win export markets overseas when we see evidence almost daily of the problems created by the federal government. This government has virtually run Australia for 12 years, mostly with state governments of the same political persuasion, although, fortunately, in the last couple of years, that has changed dramatically. We on this side hope that the situation will continue to change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will chronicle some of the problems that are huge impediments to the ability of people in this country to pick up Australia's potential in respect of Asia&mdash;potential which is highlighted in the report which is the subject of discussion today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current account deficit figures for December, which were released yesterday, are absolutely chilling. The amount of the deficit is almost $25 billion, the highest recorded in Australia's history. Accompanying the announcement is a belated indication by the government that the forthcoming budget will be a horror budget. Since its election in 1993, the government has had the opportunity to pull levers correctly for economic management in Australia. However, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in an extraordinary comment&mdash;almost an aside&mdash;during question time this week, in the absence of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), announced the forthcoming horror budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has given a confused indication to the markets, and to Australians generally, about what is likely to happen to interest rates. It now seems likely that, when the Prime Minister contradicted the Treasurer and said that interest rates will not rise in the near future, the Prime Minister was incorrect. The Treasurer, in an attempt to be honest with the Australian people and to tell the truth about why the markets are now so overheated, hinted that interest rates will rise. The government is in panic and disarray, and is unable to agree on fundamental policies. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer foreshadowed that, in May&mdash;believe it or not, a statement will be made in May, rather than now&mdash;the government intends to make clear to Australians certain changes to the economic management of the nation. These changes will involve new taxes, including new indirect taxes, and other measures by the government in an effort to try to change the direction in which we have been heading since the present government was re-elected in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that is just not good enough. How can Australians gain a foothold of worth in Asia and be encouraged to take risks and invest over there if their domestic base is threatened by this sort of mismanagement by the government. It is good to see that the government's former minister for industry, the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), is going to participate in this debate. He must feel heavy at heart&mdash;if he could speak frankly in this debate. He knows about the potential Australians have to win export markets and improve our balance of trade. But he also knows that the bottom line is that there has to be a domestic base to do that. If the proper government atmospherics and management are not there, how on earth can Australian business people possibly persuade shareholders, bankers and financiers to make the necessary huge commitments that are involved, let alone do so themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Australian wealth makers&mdash;those in business and industry, small, medium and large&mdash;are being asked to continue to make investments to win trade in Asia at a time when they do not know the sorts of taxes they are going to face. They do not know what is going to happen with interest rates, except that it is very likely that they are going to continue to rise&mdash;and they have already risen almost 50 per cent in the last six months. They know that the Commonwealth government has forced states, local government and business to curtail spending and borrowing due to the worst recession Australia has had for 60 years, which was forced by the government, in a panic situation, causing hardship to a lot of people. They know that all those sacrifices that were made during that time by small businesses that were lost and forced into bankruptcy were not worth it. And it seems that we are now going to go into another period of uncertainty, pain and lost opportunity. That is just not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I walked through the timber workers, with their continuing protest today&mdash;as all members would have&mdash;I felt very angry about the loss of opportunities. Those are decent people. Sure, they have got vested interests: their jobs, their families, their investments. Those guys are trying to pay $20,000 a month on their rigs. They have mortgaged their homes to get the banks and the financial institutions to lend the money to allow them to operate those rigs. They have got vested interests, sure&mdash;but nothing to be apologising to anyone about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those guys made their investments because the federal government assured Australians before the last election that they could invest in the timber industry, that there was going to be a national timber strategy, that the controversial, delicate and sensitive decisions about where forestry activities could and could not be carried out, and what could and could not be chipped, would be made in an organised, responsible way that everyone would respect. But what we find, under our very noses in Australia, is that the government that says, `Go out into Asia. Take all the opportunities that present themselves' cannot even come up with the right processes to handle an issue as important and strategic, but yet as fundamentally simple, as that. If the government is a manager, why can it not manage issues like that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason it cannot is that the Labor Party in Australia is made up of too many vested interests. It is paralysed and incapable of making the proper strategic judgments because it has sold itself off. The government is now faced with threatened resignations by five important regional members of the parliamentary Labor Party. A senator has already resigned in Tasmania, for different&mdash;but related&mdash;reasons. And there is more to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, if the operating of our timber industry in Australia is done properly, it is going to help us reduce our current account deficit. If we get it right, we can reduce the amount of imported supplies from the timber industry that we need every day because we have got a shortfall. What do we find? Right between our eyes, we find a government that from December has paralysed the timber industry in Australia at a time when it was trying to get our balance of trade right in its industry. The industry was trying to become self-sufficient, to reduce the amount that we have to sell off oversea to buy back value added in the form of wood-chipping and to become sustainable. I think the government's performance is disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter relates to the report. My friend the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) is correctly showing me the report and saying, `What about talking on the report?' I want to be honest here today and say, `What is the good of talking about a worthwhile report when your own government cannot even manage the domestic situation correctly?' It has an impact on our ability to take advantage of those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our friends in Asia, some of whom are very shrewd people, make assessments about whether they want to do joint ventures with us. The report contains indications of how we are going to be able to take advantage of these situations. Most of the situations in Asia are going to have to be on a joint venture basis because the people there are very pragmatic. They want to keep their own ownership intact and to encourage people to come in and invest but not sell off. I have got no real objection to that, I might add. I wish we did more of that in Australia, but we are so short of capital we are going to be driven more and more to allowing foreign ownership of more and more of our Australia, which is a hell of a pity from my point of view. Maybe if we can get enough wealth going we will be able to buy some of our own farm back in Australia, but to do that we have got to have successful investments overseas as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The astute Asian governments and investors and businessmen are looking askance at Australia. They like us&mdash;sure, they like us&mdash;but they are looking and saying, `If you guys from Australia are going to take a share in what we are going to do over here together, how do we know you are going to be able to sustain it? Your financing of this enterprise, that you say you will put forward in conjunction with your bankers and investors and all that, is predicated on the basis that your domestic base, which is the important part in the philosophy of building Australia's industry potential, is sound. If your financial security is threatened because the government does not know how to run the economy and manage it properly, you can be brought undone.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the great Australian company BHP would say today that it can do a lot of things itself and do very, very well. It has pretty good managers and they have done a lot of great things in the last 10 years to make massive changes and win markets overseas. A lot of their strategies at the highest level are predicated on their domestic health&mdash;their domestic base. If the domestic base in the economy is threatened, how on earth can we sustain activities overseas? That is the crucial point that I wanted to make today in respect of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say something else. I am a member of the trade committee of the Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. We are about to commence an inquiry into the potential of services exports into Asian countries. In Australia, we have discovered that our share of services exports to Asia and other countries is very low. In fact, we export only about five per cent of our total services activities. Most of the Asian countries that we are dealing with are already involved in economies such as Hong Kong, where 80 per cent of the economy, which is a vast economy as you know, is made up of services activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise the potential of services. We propose to have a look at two countries in particular as part of our inquiry into the potential services exports. One of them is Indonesia and the other one is Hong Kong. We will look at Hong Kong particularly because of the impending changes in 1997 and the strengthening of the opportunity to enhance Australia's prospects of gaining services investments from Australia into the great economy of China, which will dominate the world economies in the next century without a doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the briefings with my colleagues on the committee before we start our inquiry&mdash;which has been advertised, and we are looking forward to many submissions to it&mdash;I was interested to learn that we are in a very strong position in Indonesia to take advantage of their growing demands, in the services areas particularly. This is because Indonesia is going through dramatic changes where the deregulation of banking and financial services is under way. They are already starting to lower some of the barriers&mdash;as other Asian countries are examining doing, as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the complaints we all get from Australian people trying to win markets overseas is that they are blocked off by barriers that are put around the countries that we are trying to get into. One of the big challenges that the report highlights, and which I think we will have to be very good at, is negotiating with these countries appropriate relaxation of those barriers. That involves an enormous amount of work and skill, in the meantime, to get our people out and about in these countries to take advantage of the opportunities that are opening up every day. They are very exciting challenges, but I only wish I could say that the people willing to take those challenges were supported by a federal government that could do the job for them. It cannot do that. Quite frankly, we need a change of government.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I come to this debate with limited preparation, having found out only yesterday that the matter was on the books and that it would be a good idea if I contributed. So I burnt the midnight oil&mdash;and quite a bit also this morning&mdash;and read the report, trying to come to terms with the many complex issues which are part of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report itself is interesting and very thought provoking. It addresses a number of Australian public perceptions that are apparently inaccurate regarding the situation within South-East Asia. It provides sound, constructive and realistic recommendations as to what may be done. To an extent, it has been hamstrung by a limited amount of data and the small sample that was used in the case studies that were done; but the nature of that small sample is significant, particularly given the fact that the report shows that the number of companies investing in South-East Asia is not as great as it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report comes as a result of a meeting of the Standing Committee of Deputy Secretaries on East Asia, which directed the East Asia Analytical Unit to undertake a study regarding these issues. In July 1993, the Trade and Investment Forum of the National Trade Strategy consultative process endorsed the project. The formal terms of reference, which I put on record, were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to document the flow of investment into South-East Asia during the 1980s and Australia's relative share of that inflow; identifying trends, countries and sectors of major activity</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to discuss the outlook for investment opportunities and to assess the implications for Australia in foreign investment strategies. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also clear from the acknowledgments that the staff of the unit&mdash;in particular, Pamela Fayle, who is the secretary&mdash;should be congratulated for the work they have done. Congratulations are also in order for work done by Luttrell Consulting Services, Business International Australia and a range of businesses that were involved in completing surveys and in being case studies, and also to officials from Foreign Affairs and Trade, Treasury, Transport and Communications, PM&amp;C, Austrade, EFIC and the Bureau of Industry Economics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, they have come up with quite a comprehensive report which details the situation regarding Australian investment in South-East Asia and also some of the perceptions of the way that has operated over the years. South-East Asia is normally seen as the ASEAN countries&mdash;Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Philippines and Thailand&mdash;but the report also refers to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, I will focus on some of the perceptions that I think are generally held within Australia&mdash;I have certainly held them at times&mdash;which this report addresses. I have always thought it was the case that there was large-scale Australian investment, certainly over the last decade or two, in South-East Asia. I was surprised to find from the report that this is not so. The figures covering the period 1981 to 1991&mdash;comparing levels of Australian direct investment for various overseas areas, and showing the levels in Australian dollars, and the percentage of overseas investment that those amounts represent&mdash;show a very different picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within those Asian countries in 1981 the figure was $A1,774 million, which was the equivalent of 38.9 per cent of our overseas investment at that time. Ten years later, in 1991, the figure was only $1,635 million. However, given the overall increase that occurred in foreign investment, and obviously the change in Australia dollar values over that time, that represents only 4.5 per cent of Australian investment overseas. That represents, over time, a net decrease annually of one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This contrasts dramatically with investments to the UK which went from $469 million or 10.3 per cent in 1981 to $13,916 million or 38.7 per cent in 1991, an increase of 40.4 per cent. The same can be said for the United States, in terms of similar growth, and also New Zealand. But the question in South-East Asia was that that was not the case. The figures that have come through for the year June 1991 to June 1992 show an encouraging 25 per cent growth. It is only one year and, as such, it is not a huge sample, but it is a good sign that that matter has been corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue which I think has been of some concern within Australia over the years is overseas investment, by definition, taking jobs from Australia or stopping jobs being created in Australia. Offshore investment can drive trade and exports. The East Asia Analytical Unit's 1992 survey of Australian firms which invest in South-East Asia showed that 90 per cent of Australian investors were sourcing inputs from Australia. However, only one-third were sourcing more than 50 per cent of inputs from Australia. There is a capacity to link back to Australia and that capacity will vary according to the nature of the investment, the nature of the productive activity undertaken. That shows that when people invest overseas it can, and often will, result in investment back to Australia in a way that will assist the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three general effects that relate to this overall condition are export generating effects, import generating effects and export displacement effects. With respect to export generating effects, the general view is that additional sales of finished goods, components, raw materials and capital equipment will occur. They will occur on the basis that overseas operations that are set up will require assistance from the host company in Australia in the development of the overseas operations. Also, as the overseas economy that is being invested in grows, the market there will generally become more lucrative and larger. That will lead to greater demand for imports to that country and, hopefully, our share of exports from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Import generating effects can also occur. This can relate to the foreign subsidiary exporting back to Australia with a finished product. This can still lead to profit return to Australia, by the overseas subsidiary returning its profit to Australia. There are also export displacement effects where a foreign subsidiary may replace exports from Australian factories in other overseas markets. I guess the question is whether that would have occurred anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of concern, and I am certainly one who has been concerned, about the question of job losses within Australia and the movement of some companies overseas. I think that has enormous impact on particular regions and communities and on the people that that actually affects. However, I still think we have to ask ourselves that hard question about whether this would have occurred anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we in a situation, with the increased internationalisation of the economy, whereby some activities that have become essentially uncompetitive in Australia would have gone anyway? Are we in a situation where it is perhaps better, if it is the only choice available, that an Australian firm operating through an overseas subsidiary picks up that work rather than it being lost in total to any aspect of the Australian economy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question which relates to that is the question of profit repatriation. The argument often is that investments overseas do not return anything like what they should to the Australian economy. Of the case studies undertaken, only five of the 18 case studies sent less than 75 per cent of their profits back to Australia, and several were repatriating 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, investment can be successful and have benefits for Australia. I would like to profile the Ansell company, which is presently on the edge of my electorate but will be in the middle of the electorate I will be contesting at the next election. There is a case study in the report which I would like to read from. It is headed `Profile of an Australian company investing in South East-Asia', and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ansell International is an excellent example of a company which saw an investment opportunity in South-East Asia and proceeded to develop it to obtain a leading share in the world market for its main products.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes through the history of the company, from 1905. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What were the factors which led Ansell to choose Malaysia as the base for its initial investment? The principle reason was ready access to the supply of the essential raw material, rubber latex. Other factors included: reliable electricity supplies, the availability of a water supply, a suitable local work force, incentives offered by the host government and the absence of an import licensing regime. Malaysia required only 20 per cent local equity in the Ansell project, and that condition has been relaxed in recent years. Infrastructure was available and has since been considerably upgraded. The case study goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ansell's decision to locate its first overseas factory in Malaysia was the product of a considerable planning period, during which the positive factors were weighed against relative factors, such as: risk to capital, delay in receiving a return on the funds, and an unfamiliar business environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The company also assessed the political situation in each of the countries under consideration and had discussions with the (then) Departments of Foreign Affairs and Overseas Trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result has been a reduction in Australia's imports (of rubber latex) and new exports of raw materials, machinery, parts and services such as training. For Malaysia, there has been an increase in employment and a substantial increase in the operating capital of the country.</PARA>
<PARA>Ansell has shown, as some other companies have, that it can be successful operating in the South-East Asian area. But, as I have said, when one looks at those investment figures one has to worry about the question of whether that view is getting through to the rest of the Australian business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the survey, a number of reasons were given for not investing offshore in the area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the limited amount of time available to me after the division, I will turn straight to the recommendations of the report and paraphrase them as best I can. They are quite detailed, they are quite specific in the action that they suggest and they are practical in terms of their application. That is important regarding trying to address the opportunities that exist in South-East Asia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point may be paraphrased as better information. There needs to be more work done to ensure that commercial bodies and business have more and better information about what is available for them regarding assistance and what is the actual situation they face in South-East Asian markets. The survey noted the fact that many business people had perceptions as to the state of play in a particular market, but the detail and experience of recent years, in particular, showed that those perceptions were incorrect. Certainly that was the information provided by the firms which were operating in those areas. One interesting aspect was that a number of participants had not accessed government information services&mdash;the embassy, DFAT&mdash;so were essentially not fully on top of what was occurring in those areas and therefore were operating under an illusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot more work can be done through Austrade, through industry associations and through national trade investment outlook conferences to ensure that that situation is remedied, to make sure that people are in a position to understand the markets they are looking at and to realise that the markets are nowhere near as scary as many potential investors seem to believe. Better networking also is a key aspect of what needs to occur. There is not enough networking going on between Australian firms, even in terms of overseas joint ventures, as the honourable member for Indi alluded to earlier. More work needs to be done in terms of developing those linkages and putting the people into a situation where they can maximise the advantages available to them on the question of networking the local areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the question of finetuning Australia's advantages. There is a range of issues in terms of micro-economic reform and improvements in infrastructure which need to continue to occur. We need also to ensure that the advances that we have made are well known within that region, so that people there can understand that there is a value for them to recognise. As a trade investment partner and also in terms of work force skills, education and training, technological capacity and research and development, we have a number of natural advantages that could be used to greater effect within the region. Again there are consultative processes and conferences that can be utilised and it is recommended under this process that we use them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem is the question of a lack of reliable and detailed statistics regarding the situation in the region. The Australian Bureau of Statistics and other organisations need to work together to make sure we have reliable information to ensure that the opportunities in trade and investment in South-East Asia are maximised.
