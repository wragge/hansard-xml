<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In tabling this report by the Standing Committee on Community Affairs on aspects of youth homelessness, I express at the outset my appreciation and that of the committee to a number of people: firstly, Ms Peta Fitzgibbon, who on secondment from the Department of Social Security assisted the committee with great professionalism and competence; and, secondly, the committee secretary, Mr Bjarne Nordin, who contributed at his customary high standard and was ably assisted by Lynette Sebo and Jodie Williams. The fact that we have become accustomed to the quality of the work of the secretariat does not mean that we do not appreciate its performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry emanated from a reference from the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) on 11 December 1993 and was advertised in major metropolitan newspapers. I also wrote to state and territory governments seeking submissions. Almost 200 submissions were received. The committee conducted 21 days of public hearings, inspections and forums in metropolitan, regional and rural locations. Over 2,790 pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcripts were generated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will note, Mr Speaker, that there is a dissenting report, which is indeed a disappointment. It is disappointing that the opposition members of the committee have chosen to play politics with this important issue. This is the fourth report of this committee in this parliament, and the previous three have been unanimous. One gets the distinct feeling of an approaching election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While dissenting reports are not unique, the circumstances behind this one are quite unusual. Opposition members represented about only a third of all attendances at hearings and inspections. Their best attendee was the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who attended only nine of the 21 possible days. So when opposition members of the committee claim to speak on the basis of the evidence presented, their qualifications to do so are somewhat shallow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we had even commenced consideration of the draft report, it was publicly reported that the member for Berowra would submit a dissenting report if the committee refused to accept third party appeals. Throughout this inquiry he has pushed his own political and personal agenda, even to the stage where one affronted witness wrote a letter of complaint about his questioning. The decision of opposition members to marginalise their participation in the inquiry and now in the final report indicates their inability to fully participate in national debates on social policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move now to the body of the report. Youth homelessness is one of the major social problems facing Australia today. It is a topic of great emotion and great pain. Despite the seriousness of the issue, the public debate on the matter is often ill-informed and misleading. Despite what some may say, this is not an issue where the youth sector and governments engage in some conspiracy to separate parents and children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of the core issue, homelessness, is itself a matter of great debate. The report provides a definition which we consider is a practical basis for ongoing use. Homeless young people are not simply those living on the streets but primarily those who are living outside the security and support of their family. They may be in temporary shelter with friends or other family members. They may be in squats or on the streets, in short-term refuges or long-term supported accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only does the report confirm that the young homeless allowance, in general, has not been an incentive for children to leave home but also the evidence shows a significant number of homeless young children do not receive the allowance. This does not mean that some fraud may not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, you will be aware that the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare recently reported that during 1992-93 abuse and neglect was substantiated against almost 23,000 Australian children&mdash;an increase over the previous year. This is an appalling situation but it provides an insight into the dimensions of the problem of youth homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not be surprised then that researchers David MacKenzie and Chris Chamberlain report that, at a point in May 1994, there were 21,000 homeless young people in Australia between the ages of 12 and 18, with an additional 9,000 young people who had recently achieved independent accommodation but required continuing support. At a similar point in time it would seem that the equivalent number on homeless allowance, both Austudy and jobsearch, in the same age groups was less than 20,000. This demonstrates that there are more homeless youth than those in receipt of the allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The data produced by MacKenzie and Chamberlain is the most authoritative that we were given and was accepted by the committee. I should point out that the opposition members seemed to know better than these two respected researchers and dissented from those conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report outlines a range of matters that can contribute to homelessness. These include abuse and psychiatric illness. The fact that almost 60 per cent of the recipients are from single-parent or blended families suggests that family breakdown can also be a contributing factor. These factors are compounded by a quite disturbing shift of responsibility for the upkeep of young people from the states to the Commonwealth government. While this may have been arrested somewhat by the adoption of the new state-Commonwealth protocols, many of us remain unconvinced that the state governments will actually fulfil their obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are aware that deinstitutionalisation has had a major impact on our community and, in general, has had widespread support. The equivalent trend in terms of foster and substitute care has been little canvassed. We were told, for example, by the Western Australian minister that the number of wards of the state in Western Australia has reduced from 4,000 to 5,000 10 years ago to the present 659. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the notion that governments do not make good parents and that wardships is not a very good system. What has replaced it, however, has often been simply the transfer of these young people to a Commonwealth benefit with no other support. This has been not just a cost shift by state governments but also a massive abdication of responsibility for some of the most vulnerable people in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report concludes that the Commonwealth is not equipped to offer the support that homeless young people need, nor is the Commonwealth well placed to pro-actively intervene early when a family is undergoing the kind of stress that is likely to lead to youth homelessness. The very strong view of the committee is that there should be more support for young people and their families at a much earlier stage than is currently the case. There are a number of recommendations in favour of early intervention, particularly attempting to pick up the signs of family instability or trauma at the earliest possible time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have used the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in the report as both a touchstone and an implied obligation. Children do have rights, and the convention clearly states that, but so do families. The report points to the fact that the convention obliges governments to assist families to support their children. The committee strongly supports the view that the best place for young people to grow and develop is with their family and the policies of all governments should be committed to assisting in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation that a bureau of youth and child affairs be established in the Attorney-General's Department, the department responsible for the auditing of the convention, would allow the auditing process to be an effective review of state and Commonwealth policy and practice with regard to observation of the convention. The report further recommends that the bureau report on a regular basis to the Prime Minister, who would report to the Council of Australian Governments. This would help to ensure that governments, both state and federal, were acting in conformity with the convention, but it would also help to develop consistency within and between governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report further recommends that the departments incorporate and articulate in their mission statements the principles of the convention and, where appropriate, indicate their performance in prevention and early intervention in the areas of child and family support services in their annual reports. This is very much a focus of the report. For too long we have allowed this issue to be dealt with by individual departments, at both levels of government, as separate departmental policies. It is time that homeless young Australians and families in trauma were treated identically, regardless of which department they approach. In other words, there should be government policies applied by all departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We apply similar logic in suggesting that the criteria and process for determining eligibility for the allowance should be identical, regardless of whether the applicant is still at school or is seeking employment. We go further and suggest that these young people should be able to access payments from either DSS or DEET, regardless of what payment they are seeking. Our position is straightforward. There should be a single government policy which is administered by both departments uniformly and interchangeably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We set out some basic requirements for this process which particularly require face-to-face assessment by a trained social worker. It was disappointing to find that state and Commonwealth education departments are not responding better to the problems and that the students at risk program, STAR, needs a major rethink. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a community, we need to look very carefully at the matching of our rhetoric with reality. We claim that we care for our children. But, if we do, how is it that we tolerate the level of physical and sexual abuse that takes place? If we care for our children, how is it that we value so lowly, in both status and salary, the youth workers they turn to when in difficulty? If we care, why do we allow long and protracted periods of lack of support to occur? If we care, why is there such a mismatch between the incidence of psychiatric illness and the level of funds provided for young people with psychiatric illnesses? We cannot have it both ways. We cannot claim to care for our children and at the same time tolerate the obvious contradictions that exist in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a comprehensive report and a constructive one. While there are implicit criticisms of virtually all the relevant departments in state and federal governments, there are a large number of very positive recommendations. It would be unfortunate if departmental officials became preoccupied with defending their territory rather than building on the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank all the people who submitted to the inquiry and encourage them to stay engaged and to contribute further. It was obvious at the start of this inquiry that there was a great danger of the committee appearing to take the side of parents or children. The fact is that they are both on the same side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was obvious at the start of this inquiry that there was a great danger of the committee appearing to take the side of youth or of parents. At the end of the day it is obvious that there are no sides, simply a common problem. I believe our recommendations, if implemented, will improve the situation for both parents and children. I request all who read this report to read all of it because that is the only way they will really recognise the balance that it contains. The report is very pro-children and it is very pro-families, and there is no reason why governments cannot be the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee views this issue as an important ongoing matter. I indicate my availability to remain involved in the community discussions on the report and will be available to explain or expand on the report as and when I can. The committee has formally resolved that this report should be treated as a first report in that we may wish, at some point in the future, to revisit the issue in some form or other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I urge all honourable members to read the report and help ensure that there is a sensible, thoroughgoing community debate on this matter. If there was ever a topic that should unite not just all parliamentarians but all Australians then this is it, and it is in that context that I commend this report to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on the report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs headed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth homelessness</EMPHASIS> and do so in the terms that were reflected in the first paragraph of the dissenting report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This inquiry has progressed since December 1993. A great deal of evidence has been taken and carefully reviewed by the Committee. As a result, the Report tabled has achieved significant common ground with positive recommendations which have unanimous support.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However there remain some issues where it was not possible to achieve a consensus.</PARA>
<PARA>The chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), said that those who signed the dissent were playing politics. He then proceeded, with what I think is one of the most despicable comments from a chairman I have heard for a long time, to draw inferences about the extent to which people were able to attend each and every meeting&mdash;programmed for his convenience, at a time when others might not have been able to join fully in the inquiry, and at a time when the committee was undertaking other parliamentary inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that the outcomes of committee reports depend greatly upon the quality of leadership given by the chair. The extent to which we are able to achieve a unanimous view on every issue depends upon the extent to which we work to achieve a consensus. I have to say that the chairman in this case never demonstrated that capacity. It is surprising that the areas of difference were so few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, having said that, let me endorse some of his comments. I admire the professionalism of the staff who assisted in this inquiry. Bjarne Nordin has been with us for a long time and we know of his ability. Peta Fitzgibbon also gave time and service to the committee which everyone appreciated. I commend equally the professionalism of the other members of staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minutes available to me&mdash;and the extension of time that I understand may be accorded to me to give me time to develop some of these thoughts&mdash;I want to express some of the concerns I have in relation to the way in which this report may be seen. It is a very comprehensive review. It is an inquiry that was initiated because there was a good deal of concern about the provision of assistance for homeless youth requiring income support. The tables included in the report give some idea of the nature of that concern, which was the very rapid increase in the number of young people obtaining access to these benefits. The table on page 34 of the report shows that in 1987, 942 young people received the youth homeless allowance and in 1993 that increased to 10,480&mdash;a tenfold increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was always seen as a matter for concern. It was reflected, I think, by the fact that the government gave the committee this reference. The most interesting aspect of that table is that when the matter became a matter of cause celebre and very considerable public interest and the government reacted&mdash;with the support and encouragement of the opposition&mdash;by developing certain protocols with the state government authorities to provide for referral of young people who were at risk, and put in place arrangements that parents might be given a further opportunity to be involved in concerns that had been raised when young people move away from home, we see that in 1994 the numbers dropped to 9,640, a decrease of eight per cent in one year. It was a particularly germane table which indicated that there was a problem and, when steps were taken to deal with it, it presented very much more positively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also advert to one of the factors that I think this report reveals with utmost clarity&mdash;that is, that there is still an enormous shortage of reliable data about the extent of youth homelessness in Australia. It is disappointing to me and, I think, to the committee, that since 1989, when the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission looked at this matter, there were reports that suggested figures for youth homelessness as high as 50,000 to 70,000 young people, including 12- to 24-year-olds. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The numbers were very alarming. There were efforts to try to quantify that but those efforts have clearly come to little avail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that there was some additional work, which I very much welcomed, by MacKenzie and Chamberlain, who questioned, certainly, the 50,000 to 70,000 estimate. They endeavoured, through a survey in schools, to assess the extent of homeless students, and that number might be very much lower. When you look at the way in which the census is carried out and the way in which the inquiry has to be undertaken, my own view is that that data is still very unreliable in terms of giving us an accurate picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the first issue on which there was dissent. I do not consider it a major issue to warrant the comments that the chairman made but it was a matter of very considerable concern to us. It was the view of parent groups, in particular, that benefits had provided an incentive to some young people to leave home and, at times, to fabricate allegations about circumstances at home and to facilitate a successful claim; that there was not clear and unambiguous evidence before the committee that enabled it to come to a conclusion that in some cases those claims were without substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the unreliability of the data, members of the opposition dissented in relation to the conclusions that there were more beneficiaries because the numbers of homeless young people had increased, and concluded that the available evidence on the extent of youth homelessness does not support the proposition that allowances are easy to obtain. Those particular recommendations could not be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to move on, in the few moments that are available, to simply highlight what, I believe, is the underlying view of the committee. What the committee has suggested ought to be undertaken is contained in chapter 11, the section of the report dealing with parents. When the committee came to conclude what ought to be done in this area, recommendation 71 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the National Child Protection Council address the extent to which the current child protection legislation in the States and Territories provides parents with an opportunity to address claims made against them.</PARA>
<PARA>It recommended that state welfare ministers monitor closely and report on certain aspects of the Commonwealth and state-territory protocol&mdash;the number of `at risk assessments' and the outcome of those risk assessments. The committee made certain recommendations in relation to monitoring departmental responses in relation to these matters and suggested:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that requests for information made to the Departments of Social Security and Employment, Education and Training by parents under the Disallowable Instrument be audited . . .</PARA>
<PARA>They were very important recommendations which reflected the underlying concern that the committee had that parents were making some sound points that needed to be addressed. I think the committee has come up with positive suggestions as to how that might be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still have some doubts about whether or not the reference to state governments will provide an adequate system of monitoring and address the problems. That is why we in the dissent indicated that we had some reservations and went on to say that, if the issue raised with state authorities addresses the matter, that ought to be the end of it and, if it did not prove successful at a state and territory level, the Commonwealth may have to address this issue again in the future&mdash;that is, to provide parents with an access of appeal where benefits are paid or a more appropriate adjudicative approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the dissent there are also some reservations about the way in which the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child might be addressed. There was a misinterpretation of a Senate committee report in relation to that matter and the dissent deals with that. There were also some concerns about administrative arrangements. We do not intend to defend turf, but we did want to put the view that the Department of Social Security seems more appropriate to administer the programs involved rather than the continued maintenance of the disparity of programs that leads to very different regulatory approaches being ultimately implemented if we do not address the turf question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend my colleagues for their involvement in this report. I think it is an important report, and to that extent it has our endorsement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the previous speakers, I would like to acknowledge and thank the great work put into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth homelessness</EMPHASIS> report by members of staff. It has been absolutely outstanding, and I want to add that to the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I felt very strongly&mdash;in fact, very emotional&mdash;about this report because for about 18 months to two years I was involved in a voluntary capacity in a program for young people who were known as street kids. I got very close to their experience. In fact, I had several of them staying at my home for periods, so I experienced what they were going through first-hand. I wondered if I were capable of being part of this inquiry because of my emotional attachment to that experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I experienced the frustration, the anger and the alienation that some of those kids were going through. I dealt with instances of drug overdose in a public place, self-mutilation, having my car stolen in the middle of the night and feeling absolutely hopeless and impotent to do anything about what those kids were suffering because they had been on the streets&mdash;in their case, for four or five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report we are not talking particularly about those young people but talking of a stage earlier. Having experienced with them what can happen if they are homeless for long periods and if they feel that society does not give a damn about them, I was very anxious for something constructive to come out of this report that would stop other young people from getting into the situation of the kids that I dealt with. As I said, it was very personal for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental things we need to look at in this report and we need to look at when considering this issue are the reasons why young people leave home, what we can do to stop it and what we can do about it when it happens. I am concerned that, through some of the evidence and some of the discussion, we feel that the only legitimate reason for leaving home is physical or sexual abuse. I do not think any of the kids I dealt with suffered from those things, but there are a whole lot of other reasons: some were kicked out and one of them was born a drug addict and the parents did not know how to cope with that. There are many reasons why kids leave home. Psychological abuse is something I think we do not acknowledge enough. Any child who is living through constant verbal abuse, constant put-downs and has their self-esteem attacked has a very good reason for leaving home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What can we do to stop it? We have described early intervention. There are certainly not enough resources, and this mostly comes down to the states. All of us on the committee who were at a particular hearing will remember the mother of a young woman who was murdered last year while working as a prostitute on the streets. The mother was asked what could have prevented it and she said, `If there had been someone around when she was in year 6 to help deal with the problems we were having in our family relationship.' If that does not stick in the minds of everyone involved in this topic, then we are bashing our heads against a wall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early intervention is what it is about. Unfortunately, most of the states' community services departments are there to look after crisis situations; they are not there to look after parents who are having difficulty in parenting&mdash;and, let's face it, we are not born natural parents. When kids go through their adolescence they do not know how to relate to their parents. That is when the breakdowns start and, if we cannot do something then, we will be dealing with kids like I was dealing with&mdash;on the streets in prostitution and on drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to do something about it. The states are not carrying their weight. Why do we have so many wards of state in youth refuges? Why do the states themselves recommend that youth refuges take them when they should not be in youth refuges?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not got a lot of time to talk further but I really also was concerned, because of my involvement, that we spent so many hours in this committee talking about statistics. Frankly, I do not give a damn whether there are 40,000 or 70,000 kids on the streets. If there is one child on the streets, we ought to be concerned about it and we ought to be doing something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">MacKenzie and Chamberlain did a very good job in their review&mdash;and, of course, keeping kids in school is another very important aspect. If children can stay in school, then they have a chance of survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to end on an expression that I think we have all heard and that somebody smarter than me said: if we are not part of the solution, we are part of the problem. I suggest that we all ought to be part of the solution. Thank you. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, young people are our future. We have a stake in their being cared for, nourished, protected and then encouraged to reach their own independence at the right time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Brian Burdekin spoke to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs here in Canberra, he spoke of the dreadful impact that unemployment has on families because of the stress it places on families.

We even heard that sometimes the behavioural problems of some young people can split families and not the other way around.</PARA>

<PARA>There is a need for supervised accommodation for people under 17 years of age.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee strongly endorses the need to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to youth services which brings a range of workers and skills into play. The Committee saw evidence of this approach developing, whereby there was a greater integration of SAAP services with family mediation and counselling. The range of adolescent and family services within the Adelaide Central Mission demonstrated how, as part of a broad youth and family service, a youth refuge complemented and supported programs such as family mediation and counselling.</PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, support should be extended to the whole family. The inadequacy of current support services and the need for a national approach to family policy has been highlighted by the inquiry. The report recognises the need for family counselling at the right time. The committee heard from a family support service worker who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the moment, in all of our counselling services we have up to a three month waiting list. One of the things that we have noticed particularly with adolescents when they are leaving home is that if you can intervene in the family very early in that stage you can actually have a successful outcome in that the child stays at home. However, if the young person has been out of home for three months or longer, which is often when we become involved, it is almost impossible to get that kid back home successfully.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This lack of focus on national direction in family policy was all the more confusing given that there is a Minister for Family Services.</PARA>
<PARA>The health of children and young people is an important factor in the problems facing young people within families who are at risk. This is a thick report. There is a whole chapter on mental illness and youth homelessness; in all, there are 15 recommendations on this subject alone. It is an area where early intervention will have very positive results not only for those young people concerned but also for their families and the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a chapter concerning administrative processes and assessment procedures. I believe one could easily reach a different conclusion from that which was reached, and certainly the committee heard evidence from community organisations about a single payment from one department; hence, we have a dissenting report in that area. Having two large departments like DEET and Social Security resourced to administer the payment to young homeless may, in my view, lead to increased administrative costs. It also creates a gap between policy and administration, and confusion in those seeking payments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on National Capital and External Territories, I present the following report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Draft Amendment No. 12 (Russell) of the National Capital Plan</EMPHASIS>, together with the evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JF4">Mr CHYNOWETH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Draft Amendment No. 12 (Russell) of the National Capital Plan</EMPHASIS>. The committee visited Russell at the commencement of this inquiry and was appalled at the occupational health and safety nightmare that existed in these offices. The plethora of buildings, surface car parks and tangle of local roads further convinced the committee of the need to redevelop Russell in a manner which not only better reflects on its role as the nation's capital but also provides a safe working environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Progressively over the next few years, Defence plans to demolish eight of the existing buildings, undertake a major refurbishment of four others and construct three new buildings. Some of the existing surface car parks will also be replaced by a multistorey parking structure. Not only will this project allow Defence to consolidate its employees in a central location but also it will go a long way to alleviating the existing occupational health and safety problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has also examined the Russell Offices redevelopment and has recommended that it proceed. The principal purpose of draft amendment No. 12 is to complete the national triangle. The concept of the triangle was one of the key elements of Walter Burley Griffin's 1911 design for Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When viewed from the parapet of Parliament House, it is easy to see the shape of the triangle formed by Commonwealth and Kings avenues. However, the definition becomes lost as one approaches Russell. If the aim of draft amendment No. 12 is realised, the national triangle will be completed visually by linking Kings Avenue to the third arm of the triangle, Constitution Avenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee supports the concept of completing the national triangle but believes that this can be achieved visually without opening Blamey Square to through traffic, as proposed in draft amendment No. 12. In addition to its memorial role, Blamey Square also fulfils a ceremonial function for Defence. Once the Russell Offices are completed and the apex of the national triangle constructed, Blamey Square will also have a major role in pedestrian thoroughfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that the movement of motor traffic through the square would be in conflict with its memorial, ceremonial and pedestrian functions. The committee therefore recommends that Blamey Square not be opened to through motor traffic and that it be developed as a people's gathering place. This, the committee believes, would enhance two other objectives of draft amendment No. 12, namely, the creation of opportunities for ceremonies and symbolism and the creation of an integrated system of parks. Development of a people's gathering place will enhance the safe movement of pedestrians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns were expressed about the location and height of the proposed Defence buildings. The committee has made recommendations to ensure that the location and height of the new buildings do not detract from the backdrop of the hills or diminish the visual integrity of completing the national triangle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment on some of the serious shortcomings that the committee found with draft amendment No. 12 which adversely affected the committee's deliberations. The first of these was a lack of specific information about the proposal contained in draft amendment No. 12, a problem which the committee has encountered with other draft amendments. The NCPA argued that detailed designs of specific elements is more appropriately dealt with at the works approval stage. Nevertheless, the committee has difficulty in being asked to agree to an indicative plan which is less than precise in detail and subject to considerable changes in the later design and planning stages. The committee is aware that, at some future date, Northcott Drive may be linked to the proposed Majura Parkway, thereby creating a new northern gateway to Canberra and the national triangle. The committee has recommended that detailed design, planning and construction for the proposed redevelopment of Russell not preclude a wide range of development options should a new northern gateway to Canberra be considered at a future time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let  me conclude by saying that the proposed changes for Russell are significant and long ranging. If the objectives of draft amendment No. 12 are achieved in the years to come, the people of Canberra and visitors to the parliamentary zone will be able to visit an area which reflects its important role in the fabric of the nation's capital. On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the individuals, community and professional groups and government agencies that have contributed to the committee's deliberations. My thanks go to all members of the committee and the secretariat, with special thanks in particular to Cheryl Samuels, who was the inquiry secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence and looking through research, I found that the names of the parliamentary triangle were changed in 1928 by a certain Prime Minister. I suggest that, if we are doing Walter Burley Griffin's plan, we should go back to the original names, that is, Commonwealth Avenue, Federal Avenue and Capital Terrace. These names were quite good at the time when Burley Griffin made the plan. I think it would be a good thing in this year when we are looking at his plans to go back to those original names. I commend the report to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Incidentally, I have just received an invitation for Monday, 19 June to the opening of an exhibition at the National Library of Australia entitled `An Ideal City&mdash;The 1912 competition to design Canberra'. It is obvious that the winner of that competition was Walter Burley Griffin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The heart of Burley Griffin's plan for Canberra was the parliamentary triangle. The national triangle was to represent the `symbol of democracy connecting the seat of national government and the executive with the national administrative centre and the local municipal centre'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Draft amendment No. 12 of the national capital plan approves the completion of the national triangle with the extension of Kings Avenue to finally connect with Constitution Avenue. Not only does it complete the national triangle visually; it also allows the government the opportunity to upgrade facilities for the Defence workers, both military and civil, who currently work in the Russell Offices. The committee was appalled at the occupational health and safety nightmare that currently exists in the Russell Offices, where plumbing, electrical wiring and other hazards combine to make areas of the Russell Offices an unsafe  workplace. It will also allow better amenities, including retail, catering, child-care, banking and recreational facilities for Russell's many workers who are currently denied many of these services or who have to travel during their lunch breaks to carry out personal business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report stresses the need for redevelopment not to dominate the surrounding landscape and to provide a better landscape in which to work. It also stresses the need to improve road, public transport, cycle and pedestrian access. The committee also recommends that pedestrian cycle routes linking Russell Offices with the Lake Burley Griffin foreshore be carried out. Surface parking will progressively be reduced by the construction of parking structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though the national triangle will be completed visually, the committee wants to retain Sir Thomas Blamey Square as a ceremonial open space and as a people's gathering place. Sir Thomas Blamey Square was named in honour of Australia's only field marshal. It is also home to the Australian-American Memorial and the Netherlands Indies and Dutch Navy War Memorial, and is closely associated with Battle of the Coral Sea observances. As such, Blamey Square will be closed to motorised transport. Given that a new northern gateway for the national capital may enter through the apex, adequate planning of traffic flows will have to be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Canberra I welcome this development to the national capital as it will provide a much needed boost for the local building industry and offer employment opportunities for the people of my electorate. It will also give the people of Australia the national triangle that will finally complete Burley Griffin's plan. The committee has clearly recognised that, where roadworks are required on national land, the responsibility for cost lies with the Commonwealth government. In respect of other associated costs the Commonwealth government should be required to negotiate with the ACT government to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. I thank all those who contributed to the report, in particular the secretariat staff. This was the first report that I had to help out with. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by congratulating the chair, the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), for his chairing of the committee and the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Smyth). This is his second speech&mdash;it may be more than his second but it is the first one I have heard&mdash;so I welcome him to the House. I would like to also thank the secretariat for their work on this report, which as usual was of a high quality. I support the chair in his comment about the renaming of Constitution Avenue and Kings Avenue to the names suggested by Walter Burley Griffin, Capital Terrace and Federal Avenue. They would seem to be very appropriate names for two of the three roads which outline the parliamentary triangle, the third of which is already Commonwealth Avenue. That is, of course, a suitable name.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw attention to three aspects of the report that were of some concern. One was that this proposal was being considered in the absence of detailed proposals for other major roads in the area and, in particular, for the gateway road which has been suggested from Majura Avenue through to the present Kings Avenue. It was very difficult for the committee to consider these proposals without taking account of what might happen in the future. Whilst one understands the difficulty the NCPA had in coming to us with road changes at a time when it was under pressure to approve new buildings for the defence department&mdash;new buildings which were certainly needed&mdash;it nevertheless was unsatisfactory to be considering these roads in the absence of the wider road plan. The committee has attempted to produce a report which recognised that uncertainty. But I would urge the NCPA to make plans in the future which take account of the broader issues as well as the very focused and narrow ones and bring them to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, this plan drew attention to the fact that the location of the Defence Signals Directorate building had been decided without consideration of future road plans and that two other buildings had been identified for refurbishment which may have to be demolished to make way for new roads. That is adding to cost. The committee aims to minimise expenditure on both roads and buildings. That suggests there is a need for more integration of road planning with building planning. That too is an important recommendation the committee makes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point is that there is a need for greater attention to be paid to public transport infrastructure, cycle paths and footpaths when making these plans. </PARA>

Certainly in the last 12 years, with the federal Labor government there have been many reports and a commitment to all sorts of programs and initiatives, which in many respects characterise this government. The latest effort is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living on the coast</EMPHASIS>, which the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) brought in only last week. It is a beautiful document. It is glossy and has an enormous number of very attractive photographs in it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living on the coast </EMPHASIS>is the government's response to the 1993 Resource Assessment Commission report on the coastal zone inquiry.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me come to that. It is too important to Australia to continue with the present fragmentation of management arrangements, the tyranny of small decisions and the bureaucratic buck-passing alluded to in this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living on the coast</EMPHASIS>. My motion this afternoon concentrates on one small facet of this big picture of the management of Australia's coastal resources: the depletion of fish stocks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The state of the marine environment </EMPHASIS>report, which was launched in February 1995, was really quite damning. It revealed the extent of the degradation of our oceans, estuaries and bays. For example, in New South Wales, about half&mdash;50 per cent&mdash;of seagrass beds have disappeared. Fisheries in more than one-fifth of New South Wales estuaries are threatened. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The state of the world </EMPHASIS>report by the World Watch Institute, released earlier this year, also revealed that fish stocks are being overfished at an alarming rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living on the coast</EMPHASIS> makes the point that `the cumulative effort of ever increasing activity and economic development has resulted in a growing burden on marine ecosystems and the fishing sector'. It is quite clear that the fishing industry is very important to Australia. It is important to our tourism industry because fishing is a substantial recreational activity, particularly in my electorate. Many people come to my electorate and spend a lot of their time fishing. Many coastal resorts rely to a very large extent on the people who fish to visit them and support their local economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fishing is also important to our national economy in a broader sense because it has the potential to earn millions more export dollars than it currently does. It also has the potential to create thousands of jobs. This afternoon I ask: why are we importing more than half of the fish products consumed domestically in this country? Why is it that with all of this coastline around us and more potential fishing grounds than any other country in the world we actually spend about half a billion dollars a year on importing fish?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may ask: what has this got to do with the price of fish? Let me address that issue. Fish has become more and more expensive over the last 40 years. There is no doubt that that is partly in response to health concerns, but it is also an obvious response to the shortage of fish stocks. My wife, who buys fish regularly, tells me that deep sea perch have for some time been around $14 a kilo; that snapper fillets are around $24 a kilo; that flathead is more than $12 a kilo; and that mullet, which we buy for the cat, is around $7 a kilo, which is more than the price of sausages. This compares with the cost of prime beef, which is only about $9&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We treat our cat very carefully. Prime beef costs only $9 a kilo, whereas fish can cost up to $25 a kilo. Shortages of fish stocks also contribute to international tensions in many parts of the world. This problem is urgent. Degradation of Australia's marine environment has reached a critical stage, and I believe it must be solved at any cost. Australia should be a major player in the $100 billion per annum fishing industry. Certainly, some progress has been made in this country with aquaculture, but the real potential seems to be with farming fish in the wild. In other words, the waters that surround this country still seem to have enormous potential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a bit about marine researcher John Fairfax, who happens to be a constituent of mine. To his credit he has spent many hours in my office over the last five years telling me about this problem. He is largely self-taught, but I believe he has a lifetime of experience which gives him some authority with which to speak on these matters. His perhaps controversial suggestions on the need to use sewage as a nutrient source in the ocean have, however, been accepted by a number of scientists both at the CSIRO and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fairfax has attributed recent mass pilchard deaths around the coast as a natural response to the destruction of seabed grass, to which I referred earlier. He has also called for the construction of artificial reefs in south-east Queensland, particularly in the Gold Coast Broadwater. The Gold Coast Broadwater is a very popular recreational fishing spot, but rather than being a pastime on the Broadwater fishing is a complete waste of time. Anyone that used to fish there now realises that it is hardly worth fishing there at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fairfax has also called for the banning of the use of anchors in seagrass areas and the banning of jet skis in some areas. I certainly support that call. I think jet skis are out of control in many parts of Australia, particularly in Broadwater on the Gold Coast, which is in my electorate. They need to be banned in areas where they are creating turbidity and are obviously affecting the light, which in turn has the effect of further degrading seagrass areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have raised a lot of the issues in the short time available to me. Hopefully, this debate can focus attention on these important matters and highlight the importance of comprehensive rather than piecemeal solutions. I finish where I began: I am very disappointed in the government's response to this issue through its latest report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living on the coast</EMPHASIS>. which is quite inadequate in addressing the real issues, some of which I have touched on today. It looks good&mdash;it has lots of very nice pictures&mdash;but when you actually read through it, it is inadequate. The minister at the table&mdash;the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear)&mdash;interjected earlier, `What about states rights?'

I do not know of any previous government that has been prepared to look at state policies and local government development policies and tried to bring them together.

While we may legitimately say that not enough is being done, we could also legitimately say that for the first time something is being done and that it is an extremely important beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are problems. The honourable member mentioned his wife going shopping and having problems getting Australian products. It should be pointed out that while Australia is the third largest fishing zone in the world, we are ranked only 15th in world production because our waters lack nutrient rich currents and have low productivity. That brings me to a very important point that the honourable member made: we should be doing a lot more about fish farming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been so much damage to habitat along the coast and inland and so much over-fishing that urgent action is required to bring about a return to greater productivity at more sustainable levels.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1995-96 the government is cooperating with the states and territories to develop a national fish care program to protect fish resources and habitats. It will involve a lot of work. We have had pretty good support from recreational fishers, which has been very welcomed because they will be able to help government to improve community awareness and educate people about how fish habitats are affected by fishing activities, both commercial and recreational, and by commercial, industrial and residential land use practices. That should underpin programs to improve management of our natural resource base. </PARA>

Of course, there are commercial fishers who feel that protection for recreational fishers is hurting their businesses. But just as we talk about plantations in the forest industry, we can talk about fish farming in the fishing industry and eventually come up with a solution to overcome the problems faced by that industry. Sometimes we do not think ahead. Sometimes people in the commercial fishing industry are sent broke or into other businesses before we come up with alternatives and solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is great work going on in this area in North Queensland and Launceston, Tasmania. There is also very good work being done on fisheries management and fish farming. That is something that needs to be done. When I was in Taiwan and China recently there was a lot of interest expressed about buying live fish from Australia. In Australia we ought to be doing a lot more about fish farming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fish care program that is being developed in Australia should generate information and understanding within the community regarding the protection, enhancement and, where necessary, the rehabilitation of freshwater and marine habitats and fisheries. The program should empower the community to make decisions and initiate action to redress some of the problems that have been identified. We need to compliment the many government and industry programs that aim to raise community awareness, reconstruct habitats, provide employment, encourage participation by the community, undertake research and implement management arrangements. It can be used to encourage integrated approaches to natural resources management and nature conservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A broad range of existing natural resource management and nature conservation type programs offer guidance for developing and implementing an effective fish care program. One such program is the national landcare program. It is very  interesting that, with the recent drought, quite a number of people who have had businesses for many years farming oysters and abalone have been harmed because of the lack of nutrient coming into the sea. This is due to the effects of the drought. We find that the landcare program is vital not only for the land but also for our oceans. </PARA>

Also of importance is a research conference that I am convening later this year. This will bring people from around Australia to discuss the issues of sewage disposal and water waste management. Those issues are very important to our oceans and our fish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the national fish care program is to provide the guidance and strategies for national planning, coordinated actions and community participation to assist in rebuilding Australia's fisheries to more productive and sustainable levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key objectives of the fish care program should be mentioned. We need to develop an awareness among all resource users and the wider community of the important fisheries issues, the contributors to the fisheries problems and the actions that are needed to remedy them. We need to develop empowerment through a sense of ownership and responsibility among all the user groups for the sustainable use of the resource. We need to have community participation, particularly by the direct users of fisheries resources in rehabilitation and other fish care activities. We need to have sustainable resource use by fisheries groups and upstream groups by ensuring that the impact on fish resources and habitats are considered in their actions, processes and plans. We also need to have fishery management strategies and habitat consideration integrated into upstream processes and activities and programs which impact on fish habitats and the recreational resource. </PARA>

It has the potential to add significantly to fish supplies and it is an avenue for replenishing some depleted fish stocks, especially freshwater species.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1995-96 budget the government has given a high priority to coastal zone management, wetlands conservation and management and the protection of fish resources and habitats. The government has allocated $53 million over the next four years towards cooperative and sustainable management of Australia's coastline. That funding will complement the Commonwealth coastal policy. It will focus on increasing support for community participation and local government participation in coastal management, including community action in fish habitat rehabilitation. It is also designed to increase the capacity and knowledge of coastal managers and develop integrated solutions to problems such as pollution. </PARA>

The report addressed a number of matters, including changes in catchment uses, increases in sediment and nutrient run-off, coastal strip development and the loss of inshore habitats, dieback of seagrass, threat to the Great Barrier Reef caused by shipping and port discharges, effects on tourism and the overfishing of some stocks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The link between the report and recreational and commercial fishing reality is 1,000 miles apart and has a long way to go. I do not necessarily agree with my colleagues that these measures have to be carried out by the Commonwealth; I think they can be achieved by the Commonwealth putting the appropriate funding into the state bodies and taking an overview at the educational level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fishing statistics are sparse, but in 1985-86 Griffith University carried out a study, from which I combined the figures from my electorate and that of my colleague at the table, the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), covering the Wide Bay and the Fitzroy regions. Between them these two regions had 458 primary commercial fishing vessels&mdash;about 21 per cent of the state fishing fleet of 2,200 vessels&mdash;and they provided direct employment for 2,160 fishermen. They generated $47.2 million in product, with a retail value of $94 million, and stimulated a further $47 million in indirect economic activity in the Queensland economy. They also produced over 50 per cent of the open-sea prawn and scallop fishing along that area of the coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effects on the economy of places such as Bundaberg and Gladstone in my electorate are quite profound. Therefore, anything that is done in an environmental sense must be balanced against the commercial reality. Many of the firms in my area now export to Asia. A typical example of this is Mandarin Trawlers at Burnett Heads. This company began operations in late 1994 at Burnett Heads. I was present at the opening. It is a $2 million facility employing over 75 people. It will play a major role in domestic and export marketing. The general manager of the firm, Tony Mills, expects a huge boost to exports in the coming months. We have to accept that side of the equation and balance it with the environmental side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government earlier responded with the Burns inquiry. In July 1993 we had the report of the Recreational Fishing Consultative Committee in response to the Burns report. This report was presented to cabinet. It dealt with such matters as size, bag limits, area quotas, commercial catch quotas, and beam trawler bans. To a certain extent the worst fears of the commercial sector were realised. The report led to a great outcry. The state government responded with a number of measures. The government established a new fisheries policy council. It introduced a new Fisheries Act 1994, which became effective early this year. The government restructured the Queensland Fisheries Management Authority to provide for six expert management advisory committees on various types of fishing. The government also talked about a new form of zonal area committee to advise on fishery management in particular areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> we see the announcement of the appointment of a committee for my area and the Wide Bay area under the chairmanship of Bill Brennan of Hervey Bay.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking to the recreational fishermen, the one thing they ask for is a greater emphasis on education at the Commonwealth level. Attitude is all important. When children are taught how to fish, they have to be taught fishing ethics. Similarly, they want to see research into such things as fish ladders, nutrient run-offs, locks and lifts in river systems, and the scouring of rivers which have not had any great volumes of water through them because of the recent drought. If the Commonwealth started to address some of those matters and left the management to the states, the best of both worlds could be achieved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fishing is a great Australian pastime, and one that I partake in occasionally. Whether it is sport or part of one's livelihood, it is seen as one of our traditional activities.

It is also a very valuable resource economically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the CSIRO estimates, the marine resources are worth around $17 billion per year, the commercial fishing production is worth around $1.3 billion each year and recreational fishers spend $2 billion each year on their own activities. To sustain an industry as varied and important as this, we must have good and careful management that extends over national boundaries, whether by regulation or by education. This government has recognised that there have been problems with the management of our fish resources and has taken the appropriate steps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the big problems facing Australia as a nation is a lack of knowledge of many of our fish stocks. It is very expensive to research in the ocean. Although there are cooperative programs with the French and the Russians in some areas, Australia is still left with a lot of water to cover. The Commonwealth already provides around $8.5 million per year to the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, which funds fisheries research Australia-wide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also provides around $12 million per year to the Division of Fisheries of the CSIRO.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of this, as part of the 1995-96 budget, the government has been responding to some of the findings of the 1991 report on recreational fishing.

We should educate our young on the ethics of fishing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has accorded a high priority to coastal zone management, wetlands conservation and management, and the protection of fish resources and habitats. So important is this aspect of the industry that $53 million will be spent over the next four years towards a cooperative and sustainable management of Australia's coastline. This will complement the coastal policy already in place.

It will also help deal with the problems of pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particularly good wetlands project has just been finished in New Norfolk, a country town north of Hobart in my electorate. They have used a series of conjoined ponds to filter sewage through the wetlands and special species of plants to allow it to flow into the river as a pure form. It is very successful and is also a remarkable tourist spot. The platypus are coming back to the area and the bird life is plentiful. It has a walk around the ponds that is attractive and has been well used by locals and tourists alike. It was a simple solution to a difficult problem, assisted by the Commonwealth wetlands project, which allowed local government to be innovative and exploratory in its problem solving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a national fish care program to protect fish resources and habitat. The government has put $500,000 to develop this program and will complement sound fisheries management arrangements being implemented in commercial and recreational fisheries. It will also be important for addressing issues of a number of current policy documents, including the national policy on recreational fishing and the state of the maritime environment report.

<PARA>Some time ago, the member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) and I decided to raise the issue of Port Phillip Bay, and much has happened in relation to that bay since then.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did they? The last motion was in relation to fishing, and in some way this is too because of the effect of pollution on our beautiful Port Phillip Bay. I believe about 60 per cent of the world is covered by oceans, so it is appropriate that we discuss not only oceans but the bays that feed into the oceans and the rivers and drains that feed into the bays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time ago Mr Glen Agnew, a CSIRO researcher, invited the member for Isaacs and me to look at the bottom of the bay just down from the Mordialloc Creek. I was surprised when I saw the amount of sludge that covered the bottom of the bay. It was not very healthy at all, I can assure you. This is because of some pollutants that feed into the bay. Quite an amazing variety of pollutants are fed into the bay every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One pollutant that people are not aware of comes through the atmosphere from cars. Over 1,000 tonnes of nitrogen and 31 tonnes of lead every year are deposited into Port Phillip Bay. That adds to the thousands of tonnes of litter that come from our drains and creeks. The other great polluter that affects the bay is ballast water from ships. Port Phillip Bay is now just about able to cope with all this pollution and these inputs but, with the pressures coming from all directions on the bay, it must be the responsibility of local, state and federal governments to combine to save our bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the reasons Melbourne's waste water from drains and sewers is putting more rubbish into the bay is the heavier rainfall occurring due to storms. The frequency of storms could be increasing because of the greenhouse effect. In the last 18 months, the backyard of my house in Frankston has been flooded twice because drains four or five blocks up from me overflowed. I think this is happening all over Victoria, and I believe it is because of the greenhouse effect. Naturally, this is causing more rubbish to get into the bay. It is also causing the bay to rise, which is quite an interesting fact. Port Phillip Bay has risen about three millimetres a year over the past decade, which is quite a significant amount. Rainfall has increased, and the CSIRO has estimated that Melbourne will have an increase in rainfall of 20 to 30 per cent by the year 2030, caused by summer storms and the like. It is quite a large increase, and it all affects the bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is up to all of us to alleviate this problem, but in one area in particular the state government can rectify the amount of rubbish that goes into the bay. I would like the state government to make sumps to catch all the sediment and waste, and to improve Melbourne's sewerage system. A large percentage of Melbourne's sewerage system was built over 100 years ago, and it is now starting to break down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also compliment the unions. Back in the 1960s when the Carrum sewerage plant was being built the Liberal government at the time wanted to pump all the sewage down the Paterson River. The unions refused to allow this to happen, and the outlet went to Cape Schanck. I know that water is being wasted and that it should be reused, but imagine what would have happened with 30 years of sewage being pumped into Port Phillip Bay. Councils should also assist by placing litter traps at the input points, in the streets and drains. These litter traps could be pumped out or suction cleaned quite regularly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government could assist these projects with special grants, and it should also support trials of Sirofloc, a product of the CSIRO which could be developed to treat sewage and stormwater. Housing estates should be redesigned so that the water from those estates, from washing machines, baths and showers, can be re-used. The estates could be designed with built in re-charge wells where all the stormwater could go. These wells could be underneath a park or something like that and the water could be pumped out and used again. The responsibility for urban stormwater in Melbourne is shared between local and state governments, through Melbourne Water. The state Liberal government is about to sell off Melbourne Water and, with the pressure being put on our locally appointed commissioners of local councils, I can foresee that stormwater drains will be neglected. Around 50 per cent of the pollution in our water waste is from urban run-off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what is happening as a result of pollution around our bay. There has been a major decline in almost every species of fish. Commercial figures, comparing 1974 with 1990, show that flathead has declined from 70 tonnes to 25 tonnes a year; snapper, from 200 tonnes to 120 tonnes; salmon, from 120 to 25 tonnes; calamari, from 50 to 20 tonnes; anchovies, from 200 tonnes to commercial extinction; and barracuda, from 175 tonnes also to commercial extinction. The Elwood Fishing Club has stated that snapper fishing last year was the worst in 25 years&mdash;only 40 were caught in the last 10 months. Maybe we should not allow fishing while the snapper are spawning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a couple of suggestions to assist in making sure fishing stocks are conserved. There could be a licence fee for all who fish in Port Phillip Bay of around $30 to $50 per annum, with the money going into a Port Phillip Bay trust fund and to be used for research, breeding and anti-pollution measures and to buy out the scallop boat licences. Anglers, boat owners, et cetera, would be represented on the trust, and the money collected would not go into consolidated revenue. Fish taken by commercial fishermen must be for human consumption only. At the moment tonnes of pilchards, an important link in the food chain, are being used for pet food. A recent EPA report suggested that 150,000 recreational fishermen use the bay each year and spend around $291 million on equipment. I recall walking along the beach at Seaford some years ago when there was a moratorium on scallop fishing. It was just after a period of wild weather, and there were small scallop shells washed up on the beach. It was some time since I had seen that sort of thing, and it showed me that the bay can recover quite well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take this opportunity to congratulate one of our TV notables, Rex Hunt. He has taken a great stand on Port Phillip Bay. He is a local Mordialloc person and he has done his utmost to promote and preserve the bay. He deserves congratulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to mention the ballast water that comes from ships and has great ramifications for the bay. At the moment there is an infestation of an introduced fan worm spreading from Geelong. This worm occurs in the bay at densities of about 100 per square metre. This number is capable of removing a lot of the food which would have been eaten by the native filter feeders. Consequent changes to the food chain may decrease the bay's ability to absorb excess nitrogen and could lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of algal blooms in the bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Guidelines for ballast water must be established. The water should be exchanged at sea or the ballast water heated to kill any organisms in the water. These rules should be enforced by the marine authorities. Local, state and federal governments can play and must play an important part in protecting Port Phillip Bay. I suggest that a trust fund be established. This could also be part of a Port Phillip Bay authority with all stakeholders having a say. Such a body would look after this asset better than we have done so far. </PARA>

We have abutting electorates and obviously a common interest in the Port Phillip Bay area, which is of great importance. It highlights one of the problems that we not only have in that area but also worldwide. The only reason that in some areas the significance of pollution going into the oceans is not seen is that they are not as confined as Port Phillip Bay. We can see in closer proximity what can occur when things go wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In congratulating the honourable member for Dunkley, I would also like to congratulate Glen Agnew, the research diver who has done a lot of work in the Mordialloc area in looking at pollutants and the effects that they have on the base of Port Phillip Bay. I did not actually dive onto the reef, as did the honourable member for Dunkley with some of our state colleagues. But I certainly looked at some of those areas. I looked at the Mordialloc Creek region and some of those important areas for flow of water and pollutants and recognised many of the difficulties that exist there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the areas of great concern with the particular area that was dived on was a reef where there was an amount of heavy black sludge or mud. There was no seaweed growing on that area. Dr Robinson from the EPA indicated that it was concerned about the seaweed having been killed off but it was not exactly sure where it came from. That is one of the problems that we are faced with in these waterways. In fact, the flow-off from sealed areas into drains and down into Port Phillip Bay is of major concern and must be of concern to all levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am encouraged by some of the things that I am seeing. On 17 September 1994 the Victorian Minister for Conservation and Environment, Mr Birrell, actually released the target litter study where some 1,300 tagged items of rubbish were put into 30 locations from Dandenong around to Geelong to see what occurred and what the effect was. They removed 600 of those items from rivers, creeks and the bayside beaches that had actually worked their way through the water systems and into the bay. One of the things that were important to note was that most of that rubbish had got into the drain system in the south-eastern beach suburbs. That is of major concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the honourable member for Dunkley when he said that maybe we need to look at systems on the drains to stop, in particular, plastic containers. There are a number of those containers that go through the drains from the beaches. There is no means of getting them through silk traps and sieves simply because they float on the surface of the water. They tend to go right through the drain system and out into the ocean. Of course, many people do not think about those things in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some ways it is a little sad, but I suppose it is important that the need for the initiative of a beach watch service has been acknowledged. That service was launched on 5 December 1993 with a telephone number for people to ring in order to find out whether their beach was safe for swimming. That people need to do that is a reflection of one of the problems we are facing in Port Phillip Bay. It would be nice to be able to avoid doing it, but obviously that is not something we can avoid doing at the moment. There are initiatives that are being handled and this is one that obviously provides people with safety in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the middle of last year the state government looked at some major changes to the flow of water into the Mordialloc Creek that then flows through into Port Phillip Bay. It has eliminated the flow of 33 million litres of effluent into the Mordialloc Creek each day&mdash;an incredible amount of liquid to be flowing through from the Dandenong south treatment plant. As I say, that process has been changed and, hopefully, it will assist in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Money has been allocated for, and I know the CSIRO has been doing a considerable amount of work on, studies on the ecoculture that exists in the bay. In some of those areas there are indications that with some aspects a rectifying process is occurring. A lot more study needs to be done. I am concerned about the particular areas of the bay and the reefs close in&mdash;where there used to be seaweed and currently there is not&mdash;that those areas are not being dealt with in the broader context of the ecostructure and how those things are to be sorted out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One ongoing study is looking at collecting information from 42 different sites around the bay. With the way that study is working, it is halfway through. I hope that the CSIRO is able to maintain that study and that the funding continues. Port Phillip Bay will gain from it and the lessons learnt will be able to be applied to other waterways in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of things we must do. Looking at areas where the federal government can contribute, obviously the area of financial assistance for research is one that will need to continue. Some 12 months ago I was disturbed to find that a lot of aircraft were being washed on the tarmac of the Moorabbin airport. The Director of the EPA, Dr Robinson, indicated at that stage it had concerns about the run-off from the washing of aircraft flowing into the drainage systems of Mordialloc Creek but was unable to do anything about it. Subsequently, I discussed the matter with David Stack, the airport manager, who sent out a memo to the aircraft operators. But they are not there 24 hours a day to police that run-off. If personnel are washing aircraft on the grass, that is not so bad. But when aircraft are being washed on the tarmac, the run-off flows into the drainage systems and goes straight into the Mordialloc Creek&mdash;and it was having an effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that I think is worth looking at from a federal point of view is to allow EPA some types of controls over the emissions from federally owned sites. If a site is controlled by the FAC, the state authority has no jurisdiction over it. Frankly, that is an absurdity&mdash;there should be jurisdiction over it and compliance with the EPA should be a requirement for operations on federal sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, a number of areas have been mentioned by the member for Dunkley. He referred to the process of collection of foreign matter and the discharge points, and they need to be addressed. I made the point that local government at the moment is busy with its readjustment of boundaries, which will probably take it away from the types of issues we are addressing at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to persevere with this problem. It is not just something that should be looked at only on World Environment Day&mdash;which today is. We need to persevere and ensure that local governments in that area look at means to stop effluent going down their drains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people use their hoses to wash off their driveways into the drains in front of their houses. I am reminded of an article I read which stated that some 33,000 tonnes of dog droppings are estimated to go into the bay each year as a result of people washing off their streets. The nature strip is littered with it. People wash it down the drain and do not think of the consequences or of where it is going. Also a problem is the number of people who have connected stormwater into sewerage systems or vice versa, which causes a flow-over effect with heavy rain. All of these are issues that need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst this is not an issue that takes the high profile in our community that many issues do, it is one we need to continually apply pressure over. I am pleased to see that we have been able to do it across party lines because, frankly, it is a bigger issue than individual political parties. It is one we as Australians should be addressing. I am pleased to contribute to the debate as an Australian in the context of an overall parliamentary motion today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) on the motion moved by him, which is currently before the House. He has always displayed a passion for environmental issues and his concern for the long-term future of Port Phillip Bay is well known in his own electorate, in Victoria and in this House. I also pay tribute to the contribution of the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), who suggested that this is an issue that does transcend the political boundaries that often divide us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corio Bay in my electorate is an important part of the Victorian coastline. Its future and health in an environmental sense is inextricably linked to the health of Port Phillip Bay. I am pleased to rise in the House to speak in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corio Bay is to Geelong and its hinterland what Port Phillip Bay is to Melbourne and the rest of Victoria. The city and its industrial hinterland are built around Corio Bay. It is an important recreational resource for a wide range of water sports&mdash;fishing, yachting, canoeing, motor sports and, of course, swimming. The bay and its land based recreational activities are very important to the citizens of the City of Greater Geelong and the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bay is also a commercial gateway to the rest of the world. The port of Geelong is one of Australia's premier bulk handling ports. Indeed, Corio Bay and its sweeping natural beauty sets Geelong in a unique position as Victoria's second largest city. Of course, the problems alluded to here by previous speakers of environmental pollution in Port Phillip Bay are issues dear to our hearts in Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The draft report by the EPA on protection of Port Phillip Bay identified some problems which have already been alluded to by previous speakers. The stormwater run-off from residential and industrial areas presents a real problem in containing environmental pollution in Port Phillip Bay. The honourable member for Dunkley mentioned the problems we have with litter and waste, and fuel from port and harbour activities. The report also identified that the introduction of foreign organisms through the discharge of ships' ballast water is a significant problem in Port Phillip Bay&mdash;a problem we certainly face in Geelong and in Corio Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, Corio Bay is under similar environmental pressure from competing commercial and recreational uses. Industry has grown up on the shores of the bay, presenting real environmental management problems. Geelong's petrochemical and aluminium production is all located on the bay. Of course, there are strict environmental standards applied to the discharge of waste from those industries. We do face a similar problem of water pollution from run-off from the residential areas close in around the bay. I mentioned before the problem from the discharge of ballast water from foreign vessels which visit our ports on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are future environmental potential dangers from developments in the Corio Bay and Port Phillip Bay areas. I mention here that the Coode Island relocation to Point Lillias does pose some really substantial environmental challenges in managing Victoria's chemical industry waste. The recent proposals to dredge the port channel have the potential to stir heavy metals on the floor of the bay. We have to exercise some care in the management of the sludge waste from that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solutions lie in the important role local government plays in the planning and management of developments on the shores of the bay. I request the Kennett government not to sell the port of Geelong and to leave the Port of Geelong Authority in place. It is a significant manager of land in the bay area. We need a public awareness campaign in the Geelong area to increase the knowledge of citizens in the area of this particular problem. Substantial and vigilant monitoring on a continuing basis needs to be undertaken. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The even-handed nature of this debate could have been influenced unduly by a report by Environment Victoria entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Toxic sewers</EMPHASIS>. I draw to the attention of the House that Environment Victoria, in my view, has a very poor track record in producing scientific evidence in the forestry area. Most of its observations about the 1,300 coupes that the federal government wanted to re-evaluate were disproved. Environment Victoria, whose funding background and status is of a questionable nature, produced some sensational arguments on those coupes. Again, in its headline seeking a report into toxic sewers, Environment Victoria does not relate to the facts of the comparatively good state of Corio Bay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with other speakers that Corio Bay and Port Phillip Bay are in amazingly good shape, given the background of potential pollution from urban areas and ships that move through those bays. To date, the $12 million study, which has been undertaken but not yet fully reported, gives a remarkably clean bill of health to the whole of Port Phillip Bay. The Port Phillip Bay environmental study was conducted by the CSIRO, a federal instrumentality. Partners in the study were Melbourne water, a Victorian instrumentality, and the EPA, the policeman of environmental problems of Victoria from the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. So we do see very helpful cooperation between the three governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The studies coordinator, Dr Brian Newell, said the major objective of the project was to determine how the bay responds to the inputs of nutrients and toxins and how these inputs can be monitored and controlled. I am very pleased that at least there is some intelligent evaluation of this seemingly public problem of how we might keep the bay clean for individual Australians and Victorians to use and for industrial purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stormwater collection&mdash;plastic run-off coming from the urban areas after storms, which other speakers have alluded to&mdash;that moves down the drains and into the bay is a problem that these authorities are looking at very carefully. The EPA, as I say, reports to date that the bay, for all its problems of heavy metals and sewage outfall that we know about, is in pretty good condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties we have identified is the problem of foreign ships bringing ballast water into the bay, unloading that ballast water and bringing in some foreign organisms. I understand that feather worms are now evident in Port Phillip Bay. They eat the plankton, which upsets the balance of the marine environment. The marine laboratories at Queenscliff have done some good work in trying to evaluate this difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sewage outflows, which the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) has referred to, that move out to Cape Schanck obviously work quite well. The member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) and I are on the Werribee side of Port Phillip Bay. The Werribee sewage farm operates very effectively, having been established in 1894, with an irrigation program and lagooning of the sewage waste from Melbourne. That rather older process is still very effective&mdash;19,000 acres in a 21-inch rainfall provides the scope and the capacity to deal with that sewage outfall. Yet the material that moves into Corio Bay and Port Phillip Bay generally is of a very high quality, so much so that I understand it would cost half a billion dollars to replace that particular older instrumentality that works very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the federal government, through the CSIRO, for continuing its $12 million study to bring about a more sensible solution that will encourage the public, the politicians and the instrumentalities to maintain a cleaner Port Phillip Bay for the people to use, and for industries to understand that we cannot allow heavy metals and other material to pollute a bay that supports three million people in the city of Melbourne and surrounding areas. </PARA>

<PARA>I have moved this motion because I believe that the sailors who lost their lives in the tragic sinking of the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> during World War II, and their families, are owed a concerted search to find the final resting place of this vessel. In proposing this motion, which calls for a commitment by the government, I am conscious that there are several opposing schools of thought about both what happened to cause the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney </EMPHASIS>to sink in 1941 and how the government conducted subsequent investigations into the circumstances of the sinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been suggestions by some people that there has been a concerted conspiracy to cover up the true circumstances of the sinking. Others feel the whereabouts of the vessel should remain a secret forever. With this in mind, the motion before us aims to give Commonwealth support to community efforts to find the sunken HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney </EMPHASIS>and also to conduct appropriate commemorations to ensure that the tragedy of the sinking is never lost from the memory of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years there have been increased calls for a search for the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. Some groups, such as the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> Foundation Trust, which has been set up by a constituent of mine, Mr Wayne Born of Merriwa, have put in enormous amounts of time and effort searching for the possible whereabouts of the shipwreck of the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. Mr Born has held a number of meetings and has contacted members of parliament from both sides of the House and the Senate, and of state parliaments, in an effort to call for a commitment for a thorough search for the remains of the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's motion is a follow-up on the efforts of Mr Born, his committee and others. I must say at the outset that the assistance of the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> Association will be very helpful to any further undertakings to find the whereabouts of the ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In explanation, in the short time available I would like to background the circumstances surrounding the sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> as we know them now. This year is the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. But, four years before the war ended, the light cruiser HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> was involved in a bitter engagement with the German raider <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS>. The engagement occurred on 19 November 1941. As I have indicated, there are varying reports about what actually happened on that fateful day. We are told that just before 4 p.m. on that day the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> was spotted by the German cruiser <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS>. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS> tried to outrun the Australian ship, but a broken piston rod made this impossible. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> moved to intercept the German vessel and flashed a signal to the ship for it to show its letters as they approached on a convergent course. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS>, with its guns hidden, masqueraded as an innocent merchant ship for as long as possible. She flashed her call sign as that of a Dutch freighter, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Straat Malakka</EMPHASIS>, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> closed the gap between the two vessels. Once the ships were parallel and fairly close to each other, about 1,500 metres apart, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> flashed the order `Show your secret sign'. It was then that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS> hoisted the German ensign and opened fire on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two ranging shots pitched short and over respectively, but then a full salvo hit, smashing into the bridge structure and direct tower of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS> then fired two torpedos and her anti-aircraft guns amidships. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> replied with a salvo from her six-inch guns which tore over the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS>. More fire from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS> knocked out the forward turrets of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>, hitting the on-board aircraft and bringing aviation fuel over the deck. The firing continued back and forth until both ships were ablaze and wrecked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> was last seen about 10 miles from the sinking <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS> just before 10.00 p.m. She was well ablaze and limping into the night. None of the 645 officers and men survived this encounter. Of the crew of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS>, 78 died and the remainder of her 393 crew were eventually captured and imprisoned in Australia and later repatriated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> remains Australia's worst naval tragedy to this day. Relatives of the dead servicemen still wonder where their loved ones are buried at sea. Before the fateful <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS> battle, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> had been no stranger to combat. In fact, she had taken continued attack from the air as well as having her share of battle successes. On 26 June 1941, for instance, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> engaged the 1,073 tonne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Espero</EMPHASIS> in the eastern Mediterranean and sank the ship, scoring a devastating broadside and eventually finishing off the ship and taking on board a large number of Italian survivors. Michael Montgomery, in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who sank the Sydney?</EMPHASIS>, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the next week the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> was continuously attacked from the air, enduring no less than twenty-five raids in the space of a single day and exhausting her entire stock of anti-aircraft ammunition.</PARA>
<PARA>There followed a chequered and busy involvement of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> in the Mediterranean and then later in the Indian Ocean. It is fair to say that the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> saw a great deal of action. The men aboard her must have run the entire gamut of emotions during this time&mdash;from fear and anger to elation and regret. They were brave Australians who made a magnificent contribution to the war effort. Australians everywhere should be reminded of their efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened on the day the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> met her fate has been the subject of many books and articles. It has been the subject of inquiries and yet, even after all that, much of what has happened is still largely a mystery. There are stories, for example, that the Australian sailors were fired upon in the water by the Germans aboard the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS>. If this were true, it would constitute a war crime of the gravest order. Likewise, there have been persistent rumours&mdash;outlined in Montgomery's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who sank the Sydney?</EMPHASIS> and largely debunked in other works, including <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMAS Sydney: loss and controversy</EMPHASIS> by Tom Frame&mdash;that a Japanese midget submarine was involved in the sinking. The point about these views is that, in the absence of the remains of the vessels, they do remain speculative. Many of the events surrounding the sinking have been put together from the memories of surviving German mariners and from conjecture connected with the discovery of some insubstantial flotsam from the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any reasonable examination, it would appear that these resources are simply not sufficient to once and for all detail exactly what happened on that day in November off the Western Australian coast. If the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> were found, many of these nagging questions which have survived the years could be proved or put to rest. If she were found there could be, for the relatives of those who died, some relief in finally  knowing what happened and where their loved ones died. If the ship is never found, the relatives deserve the consideration of a full-scale search. At least they are owed a commitment that we did everything in our power to find the ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, regardless of the outcome of the search&mdash;and remember we are asking for a commitment of support in principle&mdash;we believe there should be some permanent memorial to the 645 officers and sailors who died that day. It would be appropriate in this year of Australia Remembers, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War, to erect a suitable memorial here in Canberra to the crew of the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. If the vessel remains lost, this would at least be a focal point for the grief of the families of these men. If a publicly funded and government supported search for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> were successful in finding the ship's remains, the question then becomes: what do we do then?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion proposes two courses of action. Firstly, the government should arrange and coordinate a suitable memorial service for the men who died. This may be held at sea over the spot where the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> now lies or it may be held on land at a suitable landfall adjacent to the location. Alternatively, it could be held in Canberra&mdash;perhaps at the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> memorial, if constructed by then. Whichever commemoration is chosen, the service should be a fitting tribute to the bravery and courage of those who served aboard the ship. It should, obviously, be attended by the close family of those who died in the service of their nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the government should ensure, without resorting to additional secrecy, that the sunken remains of the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> are protected from vandalism and souvenir hunting in some way. How this can be achieved is, obviously, going to be a matter for the Department of Defence and others. However, the important thing is that, having found the final resting place of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>&mdash;in effect its grave site&mdash;the remains should be protected from casual diving and the associated deterioration of the site which may result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said previously, regardless of the outcome of any proposed search for the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>, we owe the relatives of the officers and the crew who served aboard her in her last hours the courtesy of a full-scale search. They deserve our best efforts to trace the vessel so that we can at last unravel Australia's biggest maritime mystery once and for all. It is, therefore, the intention of this motion to ensure that the relatives are given the consideration of knowing that the government will support a concerted search for the vessel.

<PARA>I confess that I am a late, but nonetheless enthusiastic, convert to the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> cause. As the member for Perth my first contact with this cause was to be invited by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) to take part in the November 1994 commemoration of the sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. That commemoration took place between Fremantle and Rottnest in Western Australia. I was very pleased on that occasion not only to accompany the minister but also to be accompanied by my father and my young son. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of that commemoration service my father made it crystal clear to me that as a former merchant mariner he was most concerned to ensure that every effort had been taken to locate the whereabouts of the sunken <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. As a consequence, in more recent times, together with the member for Moore and my Western Australian parliamentary colleague the Hon. Graham Edwards, himself a Vietnam veteran, we have been asked in a bipartisan way to take part in the formation in Western Australia of the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> Foundation Trust. This is intended to be a community effort to ensure that no stone is left unturned to discover the whereabouts of the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. I would like to quote a letter which Mr Edwards, my Western Australian parliamentary colleague, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in November 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Towards the end of November 1941, 645 messages were sent to Australian families with next of kin on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMAS Sydney</EMPHASIS>. The message read:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">is missing as a result of enemy action. Minister for Navy and Naval Board desire to express to you their sincere sympathy.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">HMAS Sydney has been in action with a heavily armed enemy merchant raider which she sank by gunfire. The intimation was received from survivors from the enemy vessel who were picked up some time after the action. No subsequent communication has been received from HMAS Sydney and the Government regrets that she must be presumed lost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus Australia came to learn that the world famous cruiser <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMAS Sydney</EMPHASIS> had been sunk and 645 families came to learn that their husbands, fathers, sons or brothers&mdash;in short, their loved ones&mdash;were lost at sea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although Australia was in a matter of days to declare war on Japan following the "day of infamy" at Pearl Harbour and thus become preoccupied with our nation's survival, the news on Sydney stunned the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately the advent of war with Japan intervened and a successful search for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> and her men has never been concluded.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Edwards goes on to say:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Moore indicated, there are a range of controversies which surround the sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. It seems to me that the most appropriate starting point for a search of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> is, as Tom Frame puts it in his latest book on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>, to identify the haystack. Tom Frame quotes from a person who was heavily involved in the finding of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bismarck</EMPHASIS>. There is a great quote in his book where that person involved in the finding of those two famous ships says that, in most instances where one is trying to find a sunken ship, one is looking for a needle in the haystack. He goes on to say that in the case of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>, one does not know where the haystack is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need in the first instance, as Mr Edwards has pointed out in his letter to the Prime Minister, to assure ourselves that every step has been taken by way of archival search and documentary record to see if we can more precisely narrow down the location of the haystack before embarking upon a search for the needle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote from further correspondence between Mr Edwards and the Special Minister of State (Mr Johns), who is no longer at the table but who remains in the chamber. In the correspondence, the Special Minister of State advised Mr Edwards as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that you are correct in stating that the chances of finding <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMAS</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> may be slim. The lack of information and depth of water in the general area where the ship sank makes searching extremely difficult. HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moresby</EMPHASIS>, the Western Australian based hydrographic ship and the Navy's only ship with a deep ocean search capability, has in the past conducted searches of the waters in which it is thought <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> most probably lies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These searches were concluded on an opportunity basis as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moresby</EMPHASIS> passed through the area as part of her normal operational program. None of the searches turned up any evidence of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that gives some indication to the House of the difficulty in this area. In the Special Minister of State's most recent correspondence with Mr Edwards dated 21 March 1995, the Special Minister of State writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government believes that it is not in the interest of those families to have their expectations raised without real foundation that some trace of the Sydney might be found or without real knowledge that a search of all archival material might change judgements about what happened to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. The Government has made a concerted effort over many years to find the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>, but to no avail, and has reached the conclusion, after very careful consideration, that the current situation does not justify a further search.</PARA>

<PARA>That does not seem to me to be too far away from the motion which is before the House today, which calls on the government to consider supporting any move to locate the sunken vessel. It is consistent with what seems to me to be the sensible approach of Mr Edwards and others who have interested themselves in this matter, including me, to satisfy and ensure in the first instance that all efforts have been made by way of archival search and documentary study to more precisely locate, as Tom Frame puts it in his book, `the haystack' to see whether consequent upon that there is community, private and public support for a full-scale investigative search to locate the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure, and indeed it is an honour, to support this motion. I commend the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) for bringing it forward for debate in this place, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), who undoubtedly will follow me, for providing a large measure of bipartisan support to this motion. I am pleased to do this not only in the context of the very successful Australia Remembers program, which continues in 1995, but as someone who served for over three decades in the uniform of the senior service of the Royal Australian Navy, and who also over a period of time served with both sons, Pat and Rory, of Captain Joe Burnett, who was the commanding officer of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>, lost in November 1941. So I take it as an honour and a pleasure to support this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be fair to say that the circumstances surrounding this loss have generated a large degree of controversy, of confusion and, indeed, of extreme frustration. The book by Dr Tom Frame, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMAS Sydney&mdash;Loss and Controversy</EMPHASIS> is a good starting point to see why this might have been so. Tom Frame said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are presently very few really controversial events within Australian naval history and just as few controversial interpretations of that history. The loss of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> and the loss of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> after a collision during night exercise off Jervis Bay in 1964 are the two best known examples of both controversial events and interpretations. But the sinking of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> surpasses the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> tragedy in that the controversy over the actual event has been compounded by the controversy generated by historians. Consequently, the historical interest prompted by speculation over the loss of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> in the last decade has been productive in some respects and unproductive in others. The positive outcomes are principally archival and historiographical. Historians and researchers have had to examine areas of Australian naval history that had not been touched before, such as signal intelligence, convoy routing and gunnery fire control. The drawback is the preponderance of research and writing into one isolated area of history.</PARA>
<PARA>He also comments:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been three rigorous attempts by historians to explain the loss of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. In addition to Navy's efforts following the action, the official historian of the RAN in World War II and two private researchers have undertaken detailed studies into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney </EMPHASIS> . . . engagement. The least comprehensive account was that of the official historian George Herman Gill, who was commissioned to produce a comprehensive wartime history of all Australian naval operations. He was naturally constrained by the inherent editorial limits of his task in what he could say about <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. The books produced by freelance writers Micheal Montgomery and Barbara Winter took vastly different approaches to the subject. Montgomery, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who Sank the Sydney</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">?,</EMPHASIS> tended to focus on the actions of the Australian cruiser, while Winter, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMAS Sydney: Fact, Fantasy and Fraud,</EMPHASIS> concentrated on the German ship. Montgomery's work was deliberately polemical and revisionist. Winter's book was more conservative and restrained. Nonetheless, the two books had much in common because Winter, who published three years after Montgomery, was constrained to examine the issues and evidence on which Montgomery had based his provocative statements.</PARA>
<PARA>Tom Frame goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1985 the controversy over <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> has continued unabated. Fuelled by the work of Montgomery and Winter, the matters in dispute have multiplied.</PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not helpful for history to be researched, written and then presented in the midst of a controversy, particularly when the history has contemporary consequences. The existence of motives that transcend academic interests, such as determination to blame an individual, can make it very difficult for the historian to write an objective history. When the historian is subject to these influences, the history is likely to be polemical or even propagandist. This danger is underrated by both amateur and professional historians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion before the House. Although I was aware of the loss of the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> during the early part of World War II, I was not aware of the total mystery of her sinking and the fact that there have been so many theories as to what happened to her. I was interested to learn the background when the motion by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) was put forward. It certainly makes fascinating reading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the sinking occurred without any Australian survivors and therefore witnesses over 50 years ago makes me think that, even if we had a full-scale search and the time and the money, there is little likelihood that she would ever be located. A number of surveys have searched for the wreck. Some of the surveys have been routine hydrographic surveys, while others have been searches as a result of the location of unusual features&mdash;both magnetic and acoustic&mdash;near the reported location of the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> and the HSK <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS> engagement. All the searches have been on the continental shelf in depths of less than 200 metres. These surveys have been very thorough, using all the latest sensing equipment and technology, but they have failed to turn up any sign of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the details from the survivors and the direction the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> took, I would suspect that it would be extremely difficult to say exactly what time she sank and where she sank. She may have been up to three days away from the original site, bearing in mind wartime radio silence conditions and the possibility that she may have run into someone else, and some people theorise that it may have been a Japanese submarine. She may have been taking avoiding action or, once out of sight of her assailant, she may have changed course. But there is no evidence of any such things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the ship were to be located in the future&mdash;I think it would be found only by chance, if at all&mdash;then it should be declared a historical wreck and paid due respect as the final resting place of her crew, in the same way as are HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hobart</EMPHASIS> and other ships off that area. This covers points (6), (7) and (8) of the motion by the honourable member for Moore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ship's crew is commemorated individually on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission naval memorial at Plymouth in the UK.

The Gascoyne RSL is erecting a wall of remembrance to the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> and that will be found at Quobba Point, 50 miles north of Carnarvon in Western Australia. This point is presumed to be the nearest land point to the area of the action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government was asked to assist the Gascoyne RSL in 1991, and I understand that the government made a contribution. But I am sure that if it required development it would be eligible under the Australian remembers program for the war graves and the monuments. A cairn was erected there some 10 years ago by the Australian Navy Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for asking the public to fund a full-scale search, one would have to ask: what would they get for their money?

But raising false hopes should not be our task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As much as I and everyone else here would really like to know the fate of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> and her crew, I think unless by some pure chance of occurrence that she is located it is unlikely now that she will ever be found.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw to the attention of the House yesterday's historic opening of the national rail link at Melbourne by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). This brings to fruition decades of attempts by other governments to link Brisbane to Perth by one simple gauge. Seven hundred kilometres were connected through the electorate of Corangamite by hardworking men and women in record time, to budget and to a very high standard.</PARA></TALK.START>

This is a new era of rail transport that will improve the infrastructure of Australia's transport system. I pay tribute to the chairman, Ted Butcher, the managing director, Vince Graham, and all those other executives who have achieved this long-time dream of many members of this House and many Australians: we now have a national rail transport system. </PARA>

It is interesting to hear all the tributes that the member for Corangamite paid, but there is no doubt that the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who was the minister at the time the national rail policy became law, is the man who deserves the congratulations of the people of Australia. It took 150 years before we had a standard gauge line linking all of the nation's capitals, but it has happened and it has happened under the Keating Labor government. That is certainly something to be proud of. I thank the member for Corangamite for pointing that out.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise an issue which emanates out of the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. It relates to the Commonwealth Development Bank, which is the last resort as a lender for a large number of primary producers and small businesses in rural areas. During the 1993-94 financial year this bank loaned $500 million to primary industry people at a concessional rate. There has been no statement from the government about what the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank will be nor any consideration given to what will happen to the employees of that bank.

I am sure that all honourable members and all Australians will join me in condemning the shameful desecration of the grave of Eddie Mabo and in expressing our deepest sympathy to Mrs Benita Mabo and her family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an obnoxious act. Apart from the racially motivated vandalism of it&mdash;which should not be left unpunished&mdash;the fact is that it came at a time when members of the Aboriginal and Islander community were starting, I think, to feel good about themselves and about the fact that we have made progress in Australia with the passage of native title, which Eddie Mabo was associated with as the person principal amongst others who took it to the High Court. With all these things happening, one could notice a genuine change of sentiment in the community. It seemed that for that reason, apart from the explicit reasons, it was particularly unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad fact that, while all around Australia people are making efforts to eliminate racism, there are still people on the fringes who promote hatred, fear and vilification of minorities. I want to take this opportunity to send a message to these people and others like them&mdash;people who peddle hatred and who, I believe, will not succeed in turning back the clock on the process of reconciliation which is now well under way in Australia between Aboriginal and Islander Australians and non-Aboriginal and Islander Australians. These people will not succeed in prolonging the denial of the rights and freedoms of our indigenous people. They will not succeed in deterring the great majority of Australians who value a tolerant, inclusive society&mdash;including a society for them where they are accepted as equals. And they will not succeed in overcoming the determination of the Aboriginal and Islander community to continue to fight for justice and survival of their culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eddie Mabo was a great figure in the indigenous community of this country&mdash;a great figure in Australia. He was a great advocate for his people and, along with his fellow litigants, his case became a major watershed in Australian history. His contribution to the fight for recognition of the rights of the country's indigenous people&mdash;his people&mdash;will never be forgotten. I think his struggle does epitomise the qualities of tenacity, courage and pride that we all like to think are part of our national character, and they are the qualities that take us forward as a cohesive nation and help us to overcome those who would attempt to divide and destroy through hatred and fear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we all owe Eddie Mabo and others like him a great debt. The community should, I think, beyond the weight of the case that bears his name, recognise it. One of the things I will be doing is asking the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to advise me on suitable options for achieving appropriate national recognition for Eddie Mabo and the others who struggled to put to rest the shameful and patently absurd myth of terra nullius. The government will then act to ensure that a suitable monument or act of recognition be dedicated to their memory and to ensure that their struggle is not forgotten. The government will fund the repair of the grave and also its relocation, if that is what the family so wish and decide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks by saying I am grateful to hear of the overwhelming support and kindness the family is receiving from the people of Townsville. This support is a reflection, I think, of the true spirit and decency of the Australian community. I am sure Eddie Mabo's family will not let that view or that memory be lost simply by the acts of a few people. So, once again, I am certain that all members will join me in extending my deepest personal sympathy to Benita Mabo and the family and condemning the outrage that occurred on Saturday night. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On behalf of the Liberal and National parties, I would like to completely associate myself with the expressions of disgust and outrage of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) regarding this particular incident. Any desecration of any grave site is a matter of an intense personal pain to the family, the survivors and the next of kin of the person whose monument has been desecrated. Coming as it did at a time of particular moment to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, this particular act carried a special and additionally painful hurt.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me get this set in crystal clarity. There is always a case for protecting data, information and interests of the nation in particular circumstances. That is what the government has been intending with this approach, given that the newspapers in particular these days show no interest in what was called in the past the D-notice system and given the situation where, in fact, the more extravagant the claims the better some newspapers and editors prefer them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a far cry from days of old&mdash;perhaps not so old.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On radio this morning the Leader of the Opposition was asked whether the shadow foreign minister agreed with this nonsense that he said Gareth Evans was going on about about gaoling journalists. Mr Howard said he wasn't and the coalition wasn't. He said, `We're going to examine it this morning at our shadow cabinet meeting, but my gut reaction is adverse.' The fact is that Senator Evans did canvass this material with the shadow foreign minister. He said to a journalist in interview:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now we haven't seen the legislation. Obviously, we will give a formal response once we've seen it. These things depend a little on how they are actually drafted and what in detail they mean . . . in relation to the Crimes Act, but I've told Senator Evans and I've discussed on two or three occasions the response to the Samuels inquiry and I've said in broad terms that I am happy with the general outline of what the government is proposing, as was presented in Senator Evans's statement to the Senate today.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans has apparently told the Senate that he understood the opposition reserved its position on the detailed drafting of the legislation, but there was no room for doubt about the opposition's general support. Furthermore, Senator Evans showed the government's ministerial statement to Mr Downer in its final draft form. Mr Downer told Senator Evans that he had no objection to any of the proposed substantive responses to the commissioner's recommendations or the language in which they were expressed. He did say that he would continue to take the opportunity to attack the government over its handling of grievances but did not object in any way to Senator Evans's statement that the responses in the ministerial statement represent a broad measure of agreement between the government and the opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are far more gentle than you would think, Mr Speaker, and far more responsive than you would think. The fact is that we have for the first time, in the One Nation policy, brought about the establishment of a national rail highway in Australia. So, instead of having four state rail systems, we have one, and we are able to link the cities of Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and, of course, Perth, but particularly Melbourne and Sydney via a standard gauge between Adelaide and Melbourne. This will mean that in this country we can now start to develop, through modernisation of the rail system, a decent rail transport system delivering bulk cargoes and large cargoes like containers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not have to be a transport economist to know that on these very long journeys across the continent, or from South Australia to Victoria, New South Wales or Queensland, a properly set up rail system should be able to deliver cargoes, particularly containers, competitively with road, which will remove many vehicles from the roads, particularly the double vehicles which will continue to break up roads and threaten the safety of motorists on our roads. This rail system will also reduce the cost of these particular items. In this reform under One Nation $429 million was invested in upgrading the infrastructure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation train that is on its way to Perth slices two hours off the Melbourne-Adelaide leg and eight hours off the journey from Melbourne to Perth, and it will lead to a more rapid and reliable system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the weekend the Minister for Transport unveiled the proposal called Track Australia which is to propose to the states the development of a company that simply owns the permanent way, or track, so that we separate a railway business from the business of running the track in a permanent way, in which case many other operators, be it Australian National or private operators such as Brambles or TNT, can hire locomotives and pull their containers or wagons across the continent on a system that will then be run as a business to upgrade the track. So, if we have a continuing upgrade of the track, we will have an efficient rail corridor and an efficient rail highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that over the last 30 years or so the rail system has run down so dramatically. One only had to go through Victoria yesterday on this train to find that in some sections they are still passing the baton; that is, a driver cannot take a train on to a portion of the track without getting the baton for that part of the track. In this day and age, to be stopping a train and having to hand up a baton, so that the authority to drive on a certain part of the track goes only to the baton holder, provides a great commentary on the decadent way in which the rail system was allowed to run down&mdash;need I say in the main under 20-odd years of coalition governments. They could not care less about the rail system. They did not care about national efficiency. They talked about ports and wharves but did nothing about them. The mere fact of now having the port of Adelaide being able to compete with the port of Melbourne, the port of Melbourne being able to compete with the port of Sydney, and the port of Brisbane, with a rail link under One Nation into the main southern line, being able to compete with the port of Sydney will mean that we will have competition right down the east coast of Australia around to South Australia. And, by bringing double-stack containers across the continent, the port of Fremantle will be able to compete with the ports of Adelaide and Melbourne&mdash;that is, if the ideological Western Australian government will actually let it operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very great change to national efficiency. Because this is a trading country, we should be able to move containers and heavy bulk materials around the continent competitively in a system that actually works. With the competition we have been able to get into the system already and the attitude and spirit of the people involved with this project, one can see that the railway workers, the people who put the track down, the people laying the new concrete sleepers, the people who changed the gauge and the people who actually operate the system see themselves very much in a competitive business with road and want to get in and make it work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We made it very clear with One Nation that it was about binding the nation together, bringing people together and doing things together. As a consequence, we went out of our way&mdash;through the local government capital works programs, through the One Nation railway program&mdash;to do things which would be of lasting benefit, such as the National Training Authority. If you look back at One Nation and at the achievements of the National Training Authority and the first national training system, at removing the interface between the domestic and international carriage of air passengers&mdash;that is, the folding of Australian Airlines into Qantas and a competitor in Ansett being given international rights&mdash;and at the building now of the first rail highway and the consequences of that, you will see that money has been seriously spent and well spent because the whole effect of the policy was to bring the economy back to life, to growth and to strong employment growth with low inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now seeing the One Nation policy benefits coming home for the country. I do not think we could have seen a more manifest demonstration of that than yesterday when we saw this quite historic moment. All the way along the track from Melbourne to Lara yesterday and down through the Adelaide Hills today, there were people in their backyards, at the crossings and street corners waving with thumbs up wishing the system well&mdash;across one nation on the train&mdash;and not a few people said to me, `One Nation delivering the goods.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. He, like many other members of this House, understands what a complex issue gun control is. I was pleased yesterday to see on television the Leader of the Opposition comment on gun control and indicate that he would support stronger gun laws. This government has a long record of encouraging strong uniform national gun laws. Last month, at a meeting of the police ministers in Tasmania, a significant step in that direction was made. I referred last week in the House to those advances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the states have primary carriage of and responsibility in this area&mdash;a fact that was not at the forefront of the Leader of the Opposition's remarks. But, that aside, Mr Howard's statement was very welcome. However, it seems that the strain of his first foray into policy making was rather too much, because this morning when asked about this matter John Tingle of the Shooters Party said that he had had a conversation with the Leader of the Opposition. John Tingle said, `I asked him was he in fact advocating tighter gun controls and he said he most certainly was not.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have the situation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> this morning reporting that Mr Howard yesterday `strongly supported tougher gun laws' and then this morning Mr Howard assuring Mr Tingle that he was not advocating tougher gun controls. Mr Howard seems to be the Quick Draw McGraw of Australian policy making, blasting away on Sunday, firing policy blanks and his guns empty on Monday. He is a 24-hour policy hero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the federal government has long been concerned about the matter of gun control. We do not just see it as a law and order issue. Seven times as many Australians are dying from suicides and accidents from guns as dying in crimes involving guns. I believe that often the best way to approach issues of this kind is through a bipartisan approach. This is the way in which the Commonwealth government has been working with the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that regard, I commend the leadership of the Victorian government whose minister for police and Deputy Premier, Pat McNamara, sponsored with me initiatives that were raised at the police ministers conference. For that reason, I would invite the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the National Party and the shadow Attorney-General to meet with the Attorney-General and me to discuss this issue and, hopefully, reach a bipartisan approach. It will be important for the National Party leader to attend that meeting if we are to achieve a genuine approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does want a strong, consistent gun law regime&mdash;a regime that not only protects the legitimate rights of gun owners but also ensures that guns are stored properly, that there is a solid licensing system and that guns and ammunition without legitimate uses are not circulated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member will know that, under the industrial archaeology his former government referred to as the Australian motor industry&mdash;high prices, low productivity and low quality&mdash;the future of Australian motorists was very dim indeed with massive tariffs on imported cars. So they were charged through the nose for cars which were way below world standard, and you were quite happy for that policy to continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, during the tenure of the Leader of the Opposition, protection in this country rose. Can you believe that? In the mid-1970s to early 1980s protection in this country rose. It fell to this government, as it always does to make all the big changes, as I articulated earlier, to try to do something about it and do something effective with the Australian motor vehicle industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, the government removed quotas. It was a great little scam if you had a quota. In other words, you had infinity protection. Once you got over a certain number, that was it. They were the people who introduced it and kept it going. We removed those quotas and we introduced a motor vehicle plan to reduce the number and proliferation of models and makers. As a consequence we then systematically reduced the level of protection from effective rates of well over 100 per cent down to 25 per cent at the moment, falling to 15 per cent by the year 1997, from memory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That change has meant that somebody buying a standard saloon car today gets it $10,000 cheaper than when the coalition was in office in the days gone. That is what they would be paying for the old tariff-priced cars. But it is only somebody who either does not know that or who wants to lead with his chin who would ask a question such as this. As a consequence of coalition policies, the Australian vehicle park&mdash;that is, the fleet&mdash;was amongst the oldest in the Western world. It is changing now with new cars. It happened because of buyer resistance to price and it is changing now because cars are better and cheaper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has increased fuel excise. It has done so because it believed that this was an appropriate area for revenue in a fuel that was lightly taxed in world terms. If the honourable gentleman wants to direct questions to the government about fuel taxes perhaps he will direct them to the coalition Premiers, who have been straight in there for very heavy fuel tax increases and, not only that, but also for very heavy fees for licences and registrations, which I thought he might have referred to in his question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So against the backdrop of even a modicum of history in the Australian motor vehicle industry and Australian motorists who use this industry, it is very clear that the honourable gentleman does not understand what really affects the Australian motorist. One of the manifestations of why he does not understand is that they have lost five elections and he is still over there.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the Leader of the Opposition will not specify coalition policies, it is very clear in the public arena that there is one area in which we can be certain that the coalition and the government will be different, and that is in the area of industrial relations and what it means for the working conditions of some of the least powerful in the labour market, the people the Leader of the Opposition patronisingly calls `the battlers'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the government's legislation, there is a no-disadvantage test. Under that proposed by the opposition, the no-disadvantage test would be dropped. For instance, typical unskilled labourers who currently work the average amount of overtime of this group&mdash;which is 10 hours a week&mdash;will have their earnings increased by $199 per week or $10,300 a year. Without penalties, the reduction in overtime pay would be $94 a week or $4,888 per year for those people. That is a decrease of 17 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government supports overtime rates and holiday loadings and it guarantees public holiday pay. But the abolition of that element of the income of these people&mdash;that is, the overtime&mdash;would see them lose roughly $5,000 a year or nearly $100 a week. They are the people the Leader of the Opposition patronisingly refers to as battlers, and that is what they would lose under his policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me describe the situation of the part-time worker on low pay. Imagine a nurse who works 16 hours each weekend. Under current arrangements, the pay would be $299 a week, but without penalties it is reduced to $184 a week. This amounts to a loss of $5,970 a year or a 38 per cent reduction. As a consequence of removing these penalty rates and moving to individual contracts, these people whom the Leader of the Opposition cynically and patronisingly describes as battlers would suffer deleteriously and heavily as in the case of that nurse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition will tell you in relation to the government's legislation, `That's not right. Under the opposition's policy, if people want to remain in an award they'll be able to do so.' But this belies the fact that the labour market turns over 1.6 million a year. There are eight million people in the labour market, and about one-quarter of them change every year, or 130,000 people a month. Once those people change, they have lost the award protections. Over a period of, say, five years the great bulk of the labour market would find themselves out of these conditions which apply only under awards. They will be given the choice of the contract, but they will not be given the choice of maintaining these conditions. The cynicism of asking questions about battlers when you want to carve away from a nurse $6,000 a year and you want to carve away from an unskilled person just on $5,000 a year&mdash;and that is what you are about&mdash;is unconscionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would ask: why would anyone want this to happen? Is it because the current industrial relations system is delivering low levels of labour productivity? No. Over the last year, labour productivity has been running at near record levels of four per cent. Is it because our current labour market is not delivering healthy employment growth? No. In the last 12 months we have had the largest growth in employment on record of around five per cent, which is well over 300,000 jobs. Is it because the transition to our industrial relations environment has been associated with unacceptable industrial unrest? No. Strikes have fallen by two-thirds compared with the 1970s. Is it because real unit labour cost increases under Labor have been unacceptable? No. The decrease in labour costs of production since 1983 has been a very healthy 9.5 per cent: a decrease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be only one conclusion: the coalition cannot stand working people. It wants to belt them. It wants to hop into them. What an objective to say, `I spent my years in public life. What I really want to do is to hop into the people earning under $30,000, to hop into the ordinary wage and salary earners who earn under $30,000, to hop into the unskilled labourer on 22,000 bucks a year and to hop into the nurse. I want to hop into them and knock off their annual leave loadings and their overtime. I want to take those things away and push them out on the contracts. As you know, with a natural change in the labour market in about three years, the better part of half the labour market will have turned over.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said this in the past about these sorts of policies: if the Leader of the Opposition wants to be regarded as a credible and an honest person, the notion of having his party running around saying that he is representing battlers is both incredible and dishonest. These are the same people who want to take away not simply these things in the labour market but all of the other conditions associated with the social wage. The Leader of the Opposition was on radio today saying, `The social wage, what does that matter?' It matters to the average person by at least a couple of hundred dollars a week by way of health, income support and those great government programs that the Leader of the Opposition is committed to cutting&mdash;the $10,000 million in programs that he is committed to cutting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude on this point: there is a very great difference between the industrial relations policies of the government and those of the opposition. They go to supporting the very people he cynically and patronisingly calls battlers.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members will recall that over the last few days we have heard a variety of utterances from the denizens of the policy-free zone professing concern about the plight of battlers and people on low incomes. Last week the Leader of the Opposition asked a question spuriously purporting to show that there had been a deterioration in the position of battlers under this government. As I pointed out at the time, that analysis is completely flawed for a variety of reasons. Today, I would like to run through a couple of facts about the situation and the circumstances that affect people who can reasonably be described as battlers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term `battler' could reasonably describe somebody on two-thirds of average weekly earnings. When I say two-thirds of average male weekly earnings, I am talking about approximately $25,000 a year. That proportion would embrace the majority of manual workers, a high proportion of sales workers and a significant proportion of people who work in operative jobs in factories and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened to somebody in that circumstance under this government? What has happened to a single income family on two-thirds of male average weekly earnings with two dependent children in the period that the Leader of the Opposition referred to in his question last week&mdash;that is, December 1982 to December 1984? Those families have had an increase in their real after tax income of $49 a week. That is very largely due to the improvements in the social safety net, particularly the improvements in family payments. Additionally, those who are renting privately will also now benefit from receiving up to $39 per week in rent assistance where no such assistance was available in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With around 300,000 working families with 700,000 children benefiting from the additional family payment, the Leader of the Opposition over the last week also disparaged the suggestion that the social wage counts for anything significant to help families in that circumstance. I pointed out last week that the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling has estimated that the value of what is provided through the social wage components of housing, health, education and child care to a typical family with two children is around $200 a week. That is the monetary value of what is provided through the social wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In income distribution terms, which you now claim to be concerned about, the social wage is overwhelmingly progressive in its incidence. It is worth around 110 per cent of disposable income for the bottom quintile, the bottom 20 per cent. The second quintile is worth around 70 per cent of disposable income. For the top quintile, it is only worth about nine per cent. It is obviously highly progressive in its incidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened to those outlays under our government compared with the period when the now Leader of the Opposition was the Treasurer? Under his tenure as Treasurer, the value of those social wage payments per capita declined by 17 1/2 per cent. Under the present government, the value per capita of those social wage components in real terms has risen by around 75 per cent. That is the contrast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can opposition members come in here and seriously say that they are concerned about the interests of low income people? When you factor those elements in, the improvement that this government has delivered&mdash;particularly to the so-called battlers&mdash;has been stark. If you look at those who are right at the bottom in terms of income&mdash;that is, those who are dependent exclusively on the social safety net&mdash;the position becomes even more stark.

Given that the entire fall in the numbers of long-term unemployed since the Working Nation programs commenced is only 45,500, why should the public not conclude that the fall in long-term unemployment is largely the result of statistical manipulation, and that you are much less interested in helping the unemployed battlers in this country than in hiding them until after the election?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was delighted that at a meeting of health ministers, an informal ministerial forum last Friday, there was a considerable spirit of co-operation to address this problem. We were able to announce out of that the formation of a task force which will be chaired by Professor Bruce Armstrong of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and will have representatives of professional bodies, including medical and nursing colleges, Commonwealth and state governments, consumer organisations and health service executives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That task force will act quickly to recommend to government various changes to the hospital system. Its objectives will be, firstly, to assess and prioritise the leading causes of preventable adverse events and make sure that there are publicly stated strategies to ensure a reduction in the number of adverse events and, similarly, to ensure that there are measures to improve the standard of quality management, indicators to monitor aggregate quality standards in hospitals and, of course, to propose long-term educational and training responses. That will be supported by an advisory structure drawn from practising clinicians and hospital managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministers were very keen to see early results, so there will be an interim report by September of this year followed by a final report in December of this year. It is absolutely essential that we maintain public confidence in the health system. I was pleased that ministers were prepared to set aside some of their own personal agendas to work together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply advise the House that, in addition to that, there is already in existence a national hospitals demonstration program. This week I actually approved grants totalling $10 million for phase one of that program. That will consist of seven projects involving 40 public hospitals for each state and territory in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to give members an example, because it obviously relates to the task force work, in South Australia some $1.3 million has been allocated to Queen Elizabeth II Hospital to integrate and coordinate all the facets of surgical services&mdash;outpatients, pre-admission clinics, operating theatres and GP liaison. Funding will also be provided for the purchase of operating equipment and instruments to allow for more efficient theatre utilisation. I hope members will also be aware that in the budget there was some $14 million set aside which will enable us immediately to support the work of the task force with practical outcomes. That will support initiatives such as monitoring those adverse events, as the anaesthetists do; developing and implementing clinical practice guidelines; looking at the cost effectiveness of various interventions; and making sure we have better quality management of our hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those additional funds, on top of what is required under the Medicare agreements, I think need to be underlined. Ministers agreed that they were not clear about the exact level of resources that would be required here, but all are willing to provide them. I simply draw members' attention to the fact that, while I welcome the fact that the Leader of the Opposition is now telling us he understands the view of Medicare held by the Australian people and says he will support Medicare, particularly the bulkbilling components of it and community rating of private health insurance, what he does not apparently understand is that the $1 1/2 billion to $3 billion he proposes to give in the way of various tax rebates for private health insurance will inevitably come from the public hospital system.</PARA>

As part of its campaign, the opposition obtained information about the investigation which appears to have been leaked from the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission. The leaking of that material is currently being examined by an inquiry in Queensland. The opposition used that leaked information, which was only unsubstantiated allegations, to launch a vicious, baseless and politically motivated smear campaign under the cover of parliamentary privilege.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. His concern with environmental matters is well known, and I appreciate his signifying this important day with this question. Many of the developing countries we help through the aid program face severe environmental challenges, and many of those challenges have a direct impact on Australia. The fact is that Australia has the product, the expertise and the know-how to assist our neighbours to meet those environmental challenges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wellbeing of all of us depends on the environment&mdash;on its ability to provide agricultural products, safe and plentiful water, clean air, a predictable and favourable climate, and a diversity of living species. Recognising this, the aid program helps to ensure that all of our activities are based on the philosophy of ecologically sustainable development. That is set out in a document I tabled last year called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a sustainable future</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our environmental activities are funded through the aid program to the tune of over $160 million this year&mdash;that is over 10 per cent of our aid program&mdash;increased from $120 million last year. This year's program included a $25 million four-year program for clean coal technology in India, which will promote energy efficiency and improve environmental standards in the coal sector. We have introduced specific environmental initiatives, such as a $20 million `green DIFF' program under which we supply competitive Australian technology in the environmental area to a number of countries, and major initiatives in population, health and refugee programs which all go to improve the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In AusAID's environmental program, we have, for example, a $31 million coal gasification plant in Hainan province in China, which I am going to see shortly. That will save hundreds of people's lives each year by replacing the burning of coal briquettes in the home with cleaner coal gas. That will reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 94 per cent, carbon monoxide emissions by 83 per cent, and particulates and benzines by over 90 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the South Pacific, as the Prime Minister knows well, because he chaired the session of the South Pacific Forum which supported these initiatives, we have given a new policy emphasis on sustainability&mdash;working together with Pacific island countries on sustainable forest and fisheries practices through to projects which monitor sea level rises and assist biodiversity in the region. There are very many of these projects through the aid program&mdash;I will not go into detail&mdash;which help the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also through the aid program we make a major commitment to global and regional environmental conventions. We have allocated $72.6 million for the global environment facility which supports projects addressing climate change, polluted international waterways, loss of plant and animal species and ozone depletion. We allocated a further $11 million under the Montreal protocol to transfer expertise and ozone friendly technology to developing new countries. We are the only country which has an environmental audit of our aid program. The fourth of those is due for release this year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I say he deliberately lied, deliberately misled the parliament, and this was the cause of my refusing to withdraw my remark and moving this motion&mdash;I want the House to listen to this very carefully&mdash;is that he had in front of him a transcript of the only interview that I have given today. The Prime Minister said in the answer to a question, `The Leader of the Opposition on radio today'&mdash;and I had a transcript made of what he said&mdash;`said, "The social wage, what does that matter."'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I gave only one interview on radio today. It was an interview given to Alan Jones on radio station 2UE this morning. The Prime Minister quoted from the first answer in that interview in the question he answered regarding ASIS. He referred, once again dishonestly, once again untruthfully and once again fraudulently, to what I had said in that answer. He claimed that I had said the opposition was totally opposed to what the government was proposing and that, in some way, I was in some great collision with the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the Prime Minister knew what I had said today. He knew that I had made no reference to a social wage. Despite that, with reckless indifference to the ordinary basic truth that he increasingly displays as desperately he is pushed towards the next election campaign, he quite dishonestly represented to the parliament of the Australian people that I had said something that I had not even remotely gone near saying today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not an accident, it was not an exaggeration, it was not a piece of political hyperbole; it was a lie, a straight-out deception of the Australian people. I pose the question&mdash;and I am sure many people who are listening to this will also pose the question&mdash;that, if the Prime Minister can be so careless, can be so dishonest, can be so untruthful and can tell such a deliberate lie about such a relatively unimportant matter as this in the hurly burly of debate, how can the Australian people believe him whenever he says anything? You have to ask the question: why should people believe anything that Paul Keating says? They do not. Why should the Australian people believe him after his long record of having misled and deceived the Australian people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, the Prime Minister was the person who said that he was going to deliver the l-a-w tax cuts. Remember those? They have gone out the window. Remember when he went to the press club before the last election and he said, `I'm going to reduce company tax down to 33c.' What is happening at the present time? It is going up to 35c. Remember he was the person who, during the last election campaign, campaigned against our proposals because he said they involved increasing indirect taxation. What did he do immediately after he was returned to office? He bunged up indirect taxation right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is he doing in the current budget? He is once again repudiating that commitment and bunging up taxation once again. Remember his promise of no more budget deficits after the recession we had to have? Remember the promise about no taxes for age pensioners? Remember the promise about $100 million to buy private hospital beds to reduce queues? Remember the matching funding for money raised by charitable institutions during a Christmas appeal?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a rotten, contemptible piece of deception that is&mdash;to mislead the great welfare bodies of Australia on the eve of Christmas and then welsh on that commitment. That is the kind of deception for which this man, who parades as the great unifier of the nation, is responsible. But on this occasion the Prime Minister has been totally caught out. He has been totally exposed. The reason that he has been totally exposed is simple. The charge legitimately being made by the coalition against the Prime Minister that he has lost touch with the Australian battler is starting to hurt, is starting to bite and is starting to sting. The reason it is starting to hurt, the reason it is starting to bite, the reason it is starting to sting, is simple. Unlike the propaganda that is spewed out from the government side, the allegation that the Labor Party has betrayed the Australian battler is an allegation of substance; it is true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the Prime Minister do in response to an allegation of substance? The Prime Minister lurches into what he knows best. And what this man knows better than anything else is how to lie and distort his way across the Australian political scene. The Australian public has grown very tired of those lies and distortions. It has grown very tired not only of his arrogance but of his lies and distortions. The reality is that this man has promised so many economic recoveries, only to have all of his exaggerated prognostications about the future not delivered. He is the person who rhetorically said that the budget had brought home the bacon. He was the person who said that the Australian economy was flowing over with effervescence. There is one thing you have to say about the Prime Minister that really demonstrates his capacity not only for self-delusion but also for deliberate, dishonest deception of the Australian people, and that is his capacity&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have this extraordinary situation today. He was asked a question about the manipulation of unemployment figures. He demonstrated once again his dishonesty. He did not know the answer to the question so, instead of sitting down and saying that he would try to find out&mdash;and he might have won the respect of the House for doing it&mdash;he waved around a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Times </EMPHASIS>and tried to suggest that in some way people who lived in and operated governments in Europe were impressed with what was happening in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has played fast and loose with the statistical truth. He and his government have been responsible for deliberately manipulating figures on Australia's long-term unemployed. The honourable member for Goldstein asked an entirely appropriate question. The honourable member for Goldstein wanted to know why the Prime Minister had permitted this manipulation of figures to disclose the true depth of the crisis in long-term unemployment in Australia. Instead of being treated to a proper answer, he was treated to a tirade of dishonest abuse. But that is something for which the Prime Minister has become absolutely famous in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the basis of the charge that is brought against the Prime Minister today and the reason why I have taken the unusual step of moving this motion. I did it for a very deliberate reason. If I can take the parliament back to the sequence of events: Mr Speaker, I sought to make a personal explanation. In the course of that explanation I made the claim that the Prime Minister had deliberately deceived the parliament. You said that that was exceeding what was appropriate when it came to a personal explanation, so you invited me to move a substantive motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why I have moved this substantive motion is that this particular piece of deception is not your common or garden variety of Keating deception; this is cold-blooded, clinical, deliberate deceit&mdash;because he had the evidence. It is one thing&mdash;and this is the gravamen of the argument&mdash;for somebody to indulge in a bit of exaggeration and hyperbole. It is a completely different thing when you have the evidence of your lie in front of you and, despite having the evidence of your lie in front of you, you deliberately proceed to tell that lie. That is exactly what the Prime Minister did on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was the person who had the transcript. He had a transcript in front of him of the interview with Alan Jones this morning. This interview he had taken faithfully. The NMLS had given him the transcript. Good on him. I am glad he reads everything I say. I have news for him&mdash;I read it too. It so happens that on this occasion his version of the facts was completely at odds with the truth. At no stage this morning did I make any reference to the social wage. The only reference that I have made to the social wage over the last week was in answer to a question that was asked of me at a doorstop on 30 May. I did not on that occasion say that the social wage did not matter. I simply disputed the proposition that had been made that in some way the social wage made up for the fact that under the Keating government the living standards of Australian battlers had fallen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the assertion that I had made and the riposte of the government was, `Look, you have got the social wage and you wave it all around and it all whirrs back into balance and everything is okay.' What I said in response to that question was that I did not believe that the impact of the social wage wiped out the gap that had developed between the rich and the poor. That is what I said; that is there. If the Prime Minister had bothered to read that transcript, if he had been instructed by that transcript, he would not have got into this bother.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I think the truth is that the Prime Minister had read both transcripts. The Prime Minister knew that there was nothing in my transcript this morning which said anything at all about the social wage. But that fact was of no concern to him. He operates on the principle, `I lied to the Australian people at the last election and I got away with it; I got re-elected. I lied to them about l-a-w law tax cuts. I lied to them about budget deficits. I lied to them about interest rates and so forth. I thought I could get away with it. I got away with it at the last election. I will keep on doing it until I get caught out and, even if I then get caught out, I will keep on doing it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say to you, Mr Speaker: under the procedures of this House, which you invited me to use because you believed that it was inappropriate to accuse the Prime Minister of deception in a personal explanation, I charge the Prime Minister with having today deliberately deceived the parliament of Australia by falsely and dishonestly alleging I had said something about the social wage that I plainly had not. I further add that the charge is made all the more serious by the fact that he had the evidence of his lie in front of him, yet he deliberately chose to make the lie, tell the untruth and, therefore, deceive the Australian people. </PARA>

He would sit there with his white knuckles through question time flaking away because he could not take the heat in the kitchen. That is what happened today.

<PARA>Professor Ann Harding, a recognised expert on income distribution, said in reference to the opposition that it was misleading not to take account of the social wage. She went on to say that the social wage was worth almost $200 a week to a family with two children. Furthermore, her research shows that this government's spending on the social wage significantly narrows the gap between the richest and the poorest. The social wage expenditure is both pro-poor and pro-family. But what does the Leader of the Opposition say? He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . nor has the social wage done anything to halt the slide of Australian families . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This is the so-called supporter of those whom he cynically calls the battlers. Let me make a categorical reference to the actual level of payments paid now and those paid under the coalition between 1975 and 1983. Under the coalition when this man was Treasurer, for a sole parent with two children renting privately the real change per week was a $5 reduction, a decline of 3.9 per cent. Under this government in the period March 1983 to September 1994, there was an increase of $83 per week or 36 per cent. Under the Leader of the Opposition, the figure went down $5 a week or 3.9 per cent over seven years. Under Labor it went up $83 a week or 36 per cent. Yet the Leader of the Opposition has the gall and the cynicism to say that the social wage does not matter. </PARA>

Under the Leader of the Opposition's government, the amount paid to them declined by $14.64 a week. Under Labor that amount has increased by $66 a week. It has gone from a $14 a week decline to a $66 a week improvement. Yet you have the gall and the vicious temerity to say that the social wage does not matter. When I pick you up on it, you go bleating to the Speaker after question time. You were running around like the desperate, empty individual you are. You cannot cut it at question time. What was the big question that you asked the Speaker after question time? Whether or not the Speaker should have an independent status. In the whole great social and economic change of Australia in the last 12 years with the move into Asia, what is his big policy question? Whether the Speaker is independent. Big deal!

Why did they say that? Because he was a liar and he is a liar. He is a person who will say and do anything to save his own miserable hide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us remember when the tax system under the opposition leader was criminally evaded. Every sleaze in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane came up to him and the Liberal Party and said, `Lay off us; don't touch us; let us rip the Commonwealth income to pieces through criminal avoidance,' and little Honest John turned his back. The term `Honest John' was meant as a spoof on the fact that he turned his back on the interests of the public and the Commonwealth by accommodating every sleaze-ball that was tied up with the Liberal Party through the 1970s.

<PARA>In other words, his total contempt for the social wage is contained in his published statement. When I had the temerity to paraphrase him, and he acknowledges it in the parliament, he was stung and he was up whingeing to you, Mr Speaker, about being misrepresented.

Once the guy at the top starts making it up, starts lying, the corruption runs right through the government because they all start trying to justify it. You all have to come to his defence and try to pretend that black is white. You all have to come in and try to prove that what is wrong is right. That is what you do, and you will do it again at the dispatch box. You always do it. I sometimes wonder what your father would think about that kind of performance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell you what else the Prime Minister did in question time today. He said that we were going to cut $10 billion worth of expenditure, then he looked at me and said, `You've said it.' I have never said it. The Prime Minister thinks that by repeating these things over and over again they will be true, like the way he tries to rewrite Australian history in relation to Singapore, in relation to the engagement with Asia, and in relation to his maths. He has this sort of Jack Lang view of the world. Without education or without thinking, he was arrested at about the age of 18, shortly before he was sacked by David Jones. Yet he goes over and over it as though doing that is somehow going to make it true. The sad thing is that there are Australians who can be taken in by that. </PARA>

You are only on that side of the House because at the last election you said you could cut income tax without having a GST, that you could match our income taxes without a GST. If I heard it once, I heard it a thousand times&mdash;that is, no GST. What was it that the Prime Minister said? He did not say that he was promising to reduce income taxes, he actually said that he had legislated them. He said that they were l-a-w. He went down to the press club and he said that you should know the difference between a promise and l-a-w.

He got up and said, `Don't you know it was just for the cyclical change? We took it down when there was a downturn.' But that was not the point. The Prime Minister actually stood up and said that he was going to reduce it permanently. He said to this House in February 1992:</PARA>

He said they were straining credibility and we had political interference. We said at the time that the One Nation program could not be done but we did not know how far the Prime Minister was prepared to go, to actually intervene out of his office and to manipulate those forecasts. We got the truth from Tony Cole, who just so happened to be moved out of the department years after the event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) must really kill the Australian people. He gets up at the dispatch box, looks over there and says, `Never has my credibility been impugned.' We have one of the great deceivers standing up there impugning everybody's credibility on a daily basis. When he cannot find a half truth, he starts with a zero truth. The Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) got up today and said, `Those terrible people in the Senate, look what they did. They did this and they did that.' Yet he is standing beside a Prime Minister who deliberately misled the House in relation to his statement. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has probably been said in this chamber over the years but I do not think this chamber has ever seen somebody with the willingness, the capacity and the desire to lie like the Prime Minister to protect his position. It was interesting that the first person who got the Prime Minister right was John McInnes, who sacked our current Prime Minister from the menswear department at David Jones on 15 July 1967. Mr McInnes said:</PARA>

<PARA>The thing that kills me is that we go back to Alfred Deakin, who is responsible for ruining the country, or back to Black Jack McEwen, but we never actually go back to 15 July 1967, do we? No, that is probably out of his range. Mr McInnes also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He really wanted to be the boss and didn't like taking orders. You could say that he didn't really want to work at all.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is the Prime Minister could not hold down a job in private enterprise. He got into this place through ballot fraud, which prompted an inquiry by the national executive of the ALP, with the help of Laurie. What does he say about Laurie? He says, `I rescued him off a surfboard and I can put him back any time.' Laurie was the man who was magically discharged by good old Murray Farquhar in relation to the Botany council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister came into this place and in 1983 ripped the current account out and built the foreign debt to a level which we have never seen in this country. As the Leader of the Opposition stated today, he started off with a debt of $23 billion and has got it to $167 billion today. The trouble is he is not growing a profit; he is growing a loss. If you had a job in private enterprise you would know that is bad, that is not the direction you are supposed to be going. They are supposed to be trying to solidify it and turn it the other way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It never faces him, does it?

There is always some magical answer somewhere if he can only grab it and pull it back. There is always come explanation how it is somebody else's fault. If it is not Menzies, it is Black Jack McEwen, Billy Hughes, Moses or Pharaoh. You just have to go back in history far enough to try to find it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that it is false does not make it any truer by repeating it. The fact that you are going to get up here and defend the Prime Minister, alleging that he said something when he did not, is just going to expose you. The fact is the Leader of the Opposition never said that or anything like it. The fact is the Prime Minister found it was in his interests to falsely allege that because he was trying to blunt a very powerful attack that the people are being left behind by your administration. The fact is that he had to resort to that technique because he knows it hurts. It hurts you. It hurts the government. But the hurt is even greater for the Australian people, especially for the battlers that you are leaving behind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) had some kind remarks to make about my father. I thank him for those kind remarks. The opinion that he has of my father is an opinion that I share. My father's fate in political life in this country was to live the bulk of it watching the Liberal Party lie on foreign policy in, as far as the Australian electorate was concerned, the most lethal way&mdash;to the tune of 500 dead Australians. As Gough Whitlam said at the beginning of his statement in the 1969 election campaign: `They lied and lied and lied while Australians died and died and died.' That was the first time in my public life that I had heard the term `lie' used three times. The second time was by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS> when describing the budget of the then Treasurer, the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great things about being in opposition is that you only require a 24-hour memory about yourself. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition got up in this place and lied about presentations he made in the Industrial Commission when chopping back battlers' wages. It is inconvenient for him to be confronted with that now. He got up in this place and lied about his position. A lot has been hinging on so-called radio reports in this particular debate. The deputy leader just lied again when he stood up in this place and said that he had never said there ought to be a $10 billion cut in the budget. Let me now quote from Pru Goward's radio interview with the deputy leader. The transcript reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">PRU GOWARD:</EMPHASIS> I'll just put it once more.</PARA>
<PARA>She was teasing it out. She got an answer that she did not expect to get&mdash;one that suggested that the opposition was going to go for that cut. Amazed, Pru Goward asked him a second time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'll just put it once more. What does the Opposition think should be the cut in the budget deficit?<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PETER COSTELLO: Well, Pru, it's got to be greater than $11.7 billion this year, and it's got to be greater than the deficit next year.</PARA>
<PARA>There you are. That is a lie. That makes him a liar. And that makes the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) a liar when he says you called for $10 billion worth! Do not think you can slide away from this by arguments subsequent to the budget. You were presented with the fact that the government managed to get the budget into surplus both this year and next year, but you opposed the method. When invited to say how and where you would make the cuts to do this, you said, `We wouldn't make any cuts.' Somehow or other, because you do not actually say what the number would be, you think this absolves you. You think, `I am not really lying over the $6 billion like I was lying over the $10 billion when that was presented in this place.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members routinely lie and deceive, and they have been at it again during the course of the last week. On this occasion it was not the deputy leader, but the Leader of the Opposition. He got up in this place in a way that was never the experience of my father when he was in government. He consulted with the opposition in developing a response, making absolutely certain because it was a critical matter of national security. In the face of the fact that the D-notice system had collapsed, he had to lead on that and seek some support from the opposition before doing so. Having been assured by the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) of that level of support&mdash;and indeed after public evidence of it was provided by the member for Mayo immediately after the foreign minister put it down&mdash;we had the Leader of the Opposition contradicting the member for Mayo on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program and then saying it was not a contradiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition is now trying to absolve himself with the statement, `Well, that didn't really matter because what I want to talk about is the detail,' knowing darn well that everybody is prepared to talk about the detail. The substance was that there would be a legal remedy as opposed to a voluntary code. Simple problem, simple presentation, simple agreement from the opposition and now opposition from the opposition. The honourable member for Mayo, presumably having got his leader's permission for that response, now feels himself being caught up in his latest lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the Leader of the Opposition went on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program&mdash;everybody saw him&mdash;and said that there ought to be better gun control. We got a call this morning&mdash;but not repudiating it. He was not in parliament making a personal explanation saying that John Tingle lied when John Tingle got up and said, `I rang the Leader of the Opposition and he said he didn't mean what he said.' The Leader of the Opposition did not get up in here and say, `John Tingle has misrepresented me. The words mean something different.' No, he did not. He got up and lied yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There it was. It was on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program and it got the run on the Nine news in the evening, yet the Leader of the Opposition quietly called the Shooters Party and said, `Of course I was lying. I do that routinely. I lie all the time. You don't have to worry about that, John. I won't be doing anything about it. That is just yet another occasion on which I lied.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have the Leader of the Opposition getting up in this place making accusations&mdash;and encouraging his frontbench to make accusations&mdash;about the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). I could not believe it when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition got up and chose this as one of his examples of somehow or other a problem existing here on the frontbench. In my experience in this parliament, there has never been a greater piece of deception run by the opposition than the theft of those hundreds and hundreds of documents and the passing of them over to the legal opponents of the Commonwealth. Somebody who wants to take an oath of office to support and uphold his constitutional obligations just throws that out&mdash;connived by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Leader of the Opposition discovered he did not have a front bench worth a damn&mdash;at least as far as the public was concerned&mdash;he became desperate to put a name back on it and he came into this place and lied again. He had the opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs&mdash;knowing the answers to the questions that she put forward&mdash;made the fall girl, the patsy, for yet another piece of opposition deception. She got up in this place and slandered the Minister for Aboriginal affairs. The opposition was beaten back on that, as one more lie from the opposition hit the fence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had the Leader of the Opposition getting up here and saying, `As a routine matter, we will let push polling go ahead. As far as I am concerned, we won't be worrying too much about that.' He was dragged, kicking and screaming, finally to a repudiation of it&mdash;but the deed was done, the job was put in place, the questioning of it had begun and it took an age before he discovered that that little piece of deceit was exposed for what it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an opposition for which lying is routine. The gravamen of its case against the Prime Minister on this occasion really rests on this: there is no question at all that the Leader of the Opposition disparaged the social wage. That was the point of what the Prime Minister said in the remarks he made in parliament. There is no dispute about that. What the Prime Minister got wrong was that it was not said on the radio show; it was said in the opposition leader's press release. Bully! That is really terrific! It was said in the opposition leader's press release; not in his recent radio interview. If that is all you have to confess to, so what? The simple fact of the matter is that that disparaging of the social wage is a fundamental aspect of opposition tactics and was repeated both in question time today and during the course of last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that the Leader of the Opposition was up to last week&mdash;he has had a bully week and a half; no wonder he has slipped behind in the polls&mdash;was that he addressed people in Western Australia. At the same time as he was saying that he was, in all honesty, defending the battlers, he was asking questions designed to give aid and comfort to his Liberal colleague the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, as the guts were ripped out of decent tendering processes in Western Australia on behalf of a principal contributor to the Liberal Party in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was defying the industrial commission; defying due process as far as tendering processes are concerned; defying basic human decency to a largely defenceless work force; defying basic human decency to a large number of communities that rely on Stateships to supply them; no doubt ultimately endorsing the petulance that was reflected in the Premier of Western Australia's performance in abolishing Stateships&mdash;when he took his bat and ball home once he found the umpire had given them out; and then pretending that he had some commitment to what he delights in calling in this place the `battlers'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell you why the Prime Minister has iron in his soul as well as ire in his mind when he has to contemplate what the opposition believes about the battlers. You can see it in every question that the opposition asks in this place and in every social program that it attacks. The Prime Minister gets up and says that it does not matter that there are no independent studies that conform with his view that the social wage does not mean anything. The fact that there are no independent studies is, as far as he is concerned, neither here nor there&mdash;he will say it any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that, when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, he eliminated indexation on virtually every social program there was except the basic pension&mdash;virtually all of them had indexation eliminated and most of them were deliberately cut back. That is why, for his period in office as Treasurer, in terms of family support, you get a figure of minus 17 per cent. Because those programs have been enhanced, expanded and added to, you get a figure of 75 per cent. You say to the battlers in this country&mdash;particularly the battlers with families&mdash;that $200 a week does not matter to them, that it is of no concern. If $200 a week is of no concern to them, then you get your $6 billion. If you are to eliminate that $200 a week which, as far as the social wage is concerned, is said by the opposition to be a matter of absolute irrelevance&mdash;if $200 can be eliminated like that&mdash;that is when you get the $6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) on his effective application of Stalinist techniques of disinformation. He is a well ideologically trained person. I might say that he would comprehend that excrescence from the left side of politics in terms of disinformation: demonise your policy by saying that the glass is half empty instead of half full; get in here and say that of course we can abolish all those social programs concerned with the unemployed because, in some of those social programs, 40 per cent of the participants do not actually secure full-time employment at their conclusion. Forget the 60 per cent of participants who did. Forget those programs which hit as high as 90 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition thought that it was a bit foul on our part, when talking about these things in this place, to take Labour Secretary Reicht's remarks as a matter of some seriousness and import. The fact of the matter is that the OECD study said&mdash;and, indeed, throughout its report on employment it chose to name Australian programs&mdash;that the propositions we have operating in this country are exactly right; that they are what a government can sensibly do to respond to levels of unemployment and encourage those who are unemployed back into effective participation in the labour market as employed persons. We have them exactly right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite think that they can get away in here with demonisatian of these programs. They think they can get away with a sleight-of-hand, saying, `We mean we'll cut $6 billion but we're not going to tell you about it'&mdash;as though that is not deception. They think they can get away with that and slide into an election by keeping as low as possible profile as they can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why the Leader of the Opposition is tetchy here today is that, on this subject, the cat has been belled. He is not getting away with it. He was not getting away with his battlers nonsense last week. He is not getting away with his demonisation of the employment programs. Above all, he is not getting away with this notion that, as far as he is concerned, he does not have to declare himself in critical policy areas. That is not being accepted by the general public. He knows it, because that is what his private polling is telling him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition knows that he has a substantial problem with two things. Firstly, beyond himself, his frontbench is not known. Therefore, he has to bring back on to the front bench one person who is known, who has a degree of notoriety but who, with the active connivance of the Leader of the Opposition, pulled one of the greatest acts of deception, deceit and miserable behaviour that this House has ever seen&mdash;and that is what was pulled by the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), the former spokesperson on environmental matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition knows that he has to get the member for Barker back on to the shadow ministry to help cure what is a substantial problem&mdash;that is, nobody trusts his opposition frontbench.

So he has a problem with Costello. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition also knows that the public is demanding value&mdash;and that means that, when it comes down to a question of policy, they demand a performance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak about the better cities project which is currently taking shape in Launceston. The development of the Inveresk railyard site will become the centrepiece of Launceston. A figure of $10.28 million of Commonwealth government funding is being spent over five years to redevelop the railway yards at Inveresk. The site will be used for recreational, educational and business uses and will also allow the redevelopment of the underutilised Elphin showground in another part of Launceston. This is truly a wonderful project and one which will be of enormous benefit to the city of Launceston and to the northern region well into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I wish to draw to the attention of the House today is that sadly the project has become a political football for the Liberal Party. The attitude of the Liberals in Tasmania and the federal spheres alters depending upon who is doing the talking and to whom they are talking to. Sadly, the federal coalition position on better cities, confused as it is, is just another example of the policy vacuum in which it is operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me outline to the House some of the hypocrisy which the federal coalition and the Tasmanian Liberals have engaged in over better cities. In July last year, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), the opposition shadow minister for local government, issued a media release which condemned the federal government's better cities program. It was headed `Better cities&mdash;what about better towns.' The member for Maranoa begins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beneath the glossy and apparently progressive image of the better cities program presented in the program's status report released today is a tangled web of missed opportunities . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Maranoa goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of instances in which the better cities program has produced unnecessary tension between all levels of government and communities, and created monuments which seem likely to do little, if anything, to enhance standards of urban living.</PARA>
<PARA>He says further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . local authorities are justifiably envious of the capital cities good fortune in receiving hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars for the construction of inner city high-rises, which appear unwanted by local residents anyway.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the controversy that continues to surround some of the better cities projects, a portion of the $816 million may well have been spent in towns who really want, and need it.</PARA>
<PARA>He appears to be suggesting that the redevelopment in Launceston is not needed and not wanted. I assure you that the people of Launceston have had their imagination captured by this project and would resent entirely any suggestion that they would not want or need it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the quotations I have given the House, it would certainly appear that the position of the coalition on better cities was clear. It would seem that it wishes to cut, if not abandon, the program. This is certainly the position of the shadow minister for local government, the federal member for Maranoa. It seems, however, that the attitude of members of the coalition tends to change according to whom they are talking to. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was recently in my electorate. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS> on Friday, 26 May carries an article entitled `Howard backs local ownership of airport: continued better cities funding also gets guarantee'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr. Howard said funding of worthwhile better cities projects would continue. "And everyone tells me that it is a very worthwhile project&mdash;it seems to fall into that category" he said.</PARA>
<PARA>This example shows the gross hypocrisy of the opposition. It is very cynical politics on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition, telling the people of Launceston what he thinks they want to hear. There is no greater form of political cynicism than the Leader of the Opposition trying to capitalise on a local success story even while his frontbench is condemning it. I am, however, amused that the Liberals have so little to offer in my own state that they are praising Labor initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that the Leader of the Opposition's attitude is a compliment to the federal government, but I would ask how the federal opposition leader's comments reconcile with the attitude of his frontbench. This is truly an example of the opposition not having a genuine policy and simply saying what seems like a good idea at the time. It is cynical and misleading. The Liberals in government in Tasmania have taken a totally different approach. They think the project is so wonderful that they are endeavouring to rewrite history and hijack the kudos for the instigation of the project. I will read to the House an extract from the recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Tasmanian House of Assembly. Mr Benneworth, who is a Liberal member for Bass asks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can the Premier tell the House about a new boost for the multimillion dollar Inveresk railway project in Launceston and the state government's role in that project?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ray Groom replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inveresk railway area redevelopment project is one of the most significant in Tasmania at this point in time. It is a key plank in a whole package of arrangements for the Launceston area which will involve expenditure of some $70 million over a small number of years and of course that will provide a substantial boost to employment in the Launceston area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has been a major supporter of this project from day one. We played a major role in initiating the project and I am grateful to the work of our members in Bass in supporting the project, in keeping government and the local government informed and in promoting many of the ideas that have come to fruition. I particularly acknowledge the work of Mr Tony Benneworth on the Launceston Inner-city Redevelopment Committee, who has worked assiduously and with great vigour to support the project.</PARA>
<PARA>The attitude of Mr Groom and Mr Benneworth appears to be in direct contrast to some of their federal colleagues. Not only do they not want the project cut but apparently the whole thing was their idea. This really caps off the cynical political attitude of the Liberals on this whole issue. The state Liberals have no vision; they have to steal it. The federal opposition has no policy, apart from whatever seems good at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The true story is that this is a federal government program. The initial application was carried by Alderman Graeme Beams, the then mayor of the Launceston City Council, and former Deputy Prime Minister Mr Lance Barnard. I myself lobbied very hard for this project during my first campaign and for several years prior to my election. Credit should be given where credit is due. This project is not a political football; it is Launceston's greatest asset. I condemn the federal opposition and I condemn the Tasmanian state government for trying to use it for its own cynical gain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House an extremely disturbing situation in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer to the tolerance&mdash;indeed, promotion&mdash;of senior diplomats known to DFAT and the Australian Federal Police as paedophiles. The most serious case of officially tolerated paedophilia is Mr John Holloway, the former ambassador in Manila and Cambodia, who is now enjoying a $500,000 package funded by Australian taxpayers to coordinate the ministry of foreign affairs in Cambodia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been reliably informed by senior departmental sources in DFAT and senior investigating police officers that there are approximately 20&mdash;I repeat, 20&mdash;Senior Executive Service, SES, officers who are engaged in paedophile activities within Australia and overseas. Not only are known paedophiles tolerated by the senior management of DFAT but they are actively promoted. For example, a senior ambassador was recently promoted from AusAID to First Assistant Secretary in DFAT. Mr Costello, the Secretary to DFAT, was aware of the proclivities of this officer but did not veto his appointment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paedophile network in DFAT is also facilitated by the new rule that allows same sex partners to have all the rights and advantages of spouses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distortion of the strict rules on adoption has seen senior DFAT personnel adopt Asian children, who are subsequently used for sexual purposes. I am informed by senior police sources that DFAT is obstructing and attempting to prevent examination of the relevant documents in an obvious attempt to smother the issue and to deter honest departmental witnesses from being heard or providing evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does the paedophile network in DFAT seek to represent Australia in Asia? The primary reason is that child sex is not illegal in those countries. Young children are available and cheap. There are immense difficulties in laying charges and proving the age of victims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paedophiles are extremely skilled in avoiding detection. One of their favourite techniques is to employ locally engaged staff of a vulnerable age which provides them with cover for their deviant activities. I hardly need to remind the House that this despicable conduct has been illegal under Australian laws for over two years. Yet, to date, not one DFAT officer has been seriously investigated or charged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The activities of the DFAT paedophile network are damaging our reputation in the region and are a public health risk and a security risk.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberal Party of Australia in this place, and in the Senate, has hit new lows in its contempt for the parliamentary institution and parliamentary privilege. But even the Liberal Party has had the sense to disendorse the member for Deakin (Mr Aldred), and I seriously hope that is the last time we see him in this chamber. For the member to make those accusations without having presented them to the relevant minister and without having given the government notice of them is absolutely beneath contempt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I grieve for people in the electorate of Wills because, as I shall demonstrate to the House, they are not being represented in this place by a full-time member. Of course, the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) has plenty of things to say about members on both sides of the House, and it is timely at this stage of the parliamentary term to bring the member to account and examine his voting record&mdash;in fact, to examine his record of absenteeism. I had an example of this just last Thursday when I was working away in my office towards the end of our parliamentary sitting day and I tuned into the local ABC radio station. I heard the member for Wills giving a report about the parliamentary week&mdash;the parliamentary week which had not then finished. As he described to the radio announcer, he was enjoying a chardonnay at the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad he raised that on national radio, because the electors of Wills would be very interested to learn that while the parliament was still sitting on a Thursday afternoon their member was enjoying chardonnay at the airport. That, of course, demonstrates what we on this side of the House have always known&mdash;that he is a chardonnay socialist to his bootstraps. He demonstrated as much on national radio last Thursday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is useful to examine the record of absenteeism established by the member for Wills. I turn to his voting record in this place for 1993. In the parliamentary term that commenced in March 1993 until the end of that year there were 102 divisions. The member for Wills attended just 50 of them. He did not vote on 52 divisions in this House in 1993. These divisions were not on trivial matters. He did not vote on the appropriation bills. In fact, he missed two votes on them. He did not express any voting intention or record any attitude on the voting sheets for a budget of $115 billion. This self-proclaimed champion of the workers did not vote on the landmark Industrial Relations Reform Bill. He missed four votes on the Native Title Bill. One would have thought that every member of this parliament would have wanted to express an opinion in divisions on the Native Title Bill. But the self-proclaimed moraliser on behalf of Aboriginal people did not bother to vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all the speeches he makes in this place about his interest in tariff policy, he did not vote on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill, two crucial pieces of legislation. He also missed the division on the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. The people of Wills were unrepresented by their member on the division for the allocation of funds by this parliament to the states for education, health and housing. There is no doubt that in 1993 and beyond the people of Wills deserve better representation than that. They deserve much better than an absentee member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the voting record of the member for Wills for the calendar year 1994. The House had 84 divisions in that year. Quite remarkably, the member for Wills was absent for 52 of those divisions&mdash;an absentee rate of 62 per cent. For 62 per cent of divisions he was not in this chamber representing the views of his constituents. He missed votes on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), the ATSIC amendment legislation, the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill and the ANL Guarantee Bill. He tells the maritime unions that he is one of their champions in this place, yet he did not bother to record a vote on the ANL Guarantee Bill. He missed the Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill. He missed the Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill. He missed another important piece of industrial relations legislation, the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the absenteeism of the member for Wills gets even worse. In 1995, up to 30 March where I concluded my research, this House had divisions on 29 occasions. The member for Wills was absent for 14 of them. He has been absent from important divisions in this place for about 50 per cent of the time thus far in 1995. Legislation he has missed includes the Auditor-General Bill (No. 5) 1994 and the Corporations Law (Securities And Futures) Amendment Bill 1994. In this term of parliament since March 1993, the House has divided on 215 occasions. Shamefully, the member for Wills has been absent on 118 of those occasions. Surely the people of Wills deserve better than an absentee member; someone who is not here on 55 per cent of the occasions on which the House divides. The people of Wills are totally unrepresented in this place on 55 per cent of the occasions on which the House divides on legislation or other matters. Their member is only 45 per cent of a member. For the rest of the time he is absent from the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call upon the member for Wills not to rip off the public purse by attending on only 45 per cent of occasions, for 45 per cent of divisions, yet taking 100 per cent of his salary. He should donate 55 per cent of his salary to a charity&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Rocher)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! The honourable member is getting very close to ascribing improper motives to an honourable member. I ask him to be careful with the words he chooses. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker. There is no doubt that the people of Wills deserve much better than a half-time member. They deserve much better than someone who carries the nickname in this place and throughout the electorate of Wills as either `Part-time Phil' or `Clock-off Cleary'. The only confusion I have on this matter is how he should be known for such a disgraceful rate of absenteeism: is it `Part-time Phil' or `Clock-off Cleary'?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same member who in the 1992 Wills by-election campaigned on the slogan that he could make a difference. What difference has he made in this place when he has not even been here on 55 per cent of the occasions when the House divided. He has made no difference at all because he has revealed, through his pattern of absenteeism, the total impotence of Independents. He cannot make a difference in this House. He knows he cannot make a difference in this House, and that is why for 55 per cent of the divisions he has been absent. He was at Canberra airport drinking chardonnay or he was back enjoying his extravagant lifestyle in Melbourne. He was everywhere except the place he should have been&mdash;in this chamber, voting on behalf of his electorate according to his views on legislation and divisions before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the people should not put up with a member who is only part time. They should not put up with a member who carries the nickname `Part-time Phil' or `Clock-off Cleary' in this place. They should elect at the first available opportunity a full-time member of parliament who can represent their needs on a full-time basis and be here&mdash;not at the airport drinking chardonnay; the chardonnay socialist in the first-class lounge at Canberra airport. He should be here representing his electorate, instead of missing 55 per cent of divisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Workers in his electorate will be astounded by this. Carpenters in the electorate of Wills who missed 55 per cent of their work would not receive 100 per cent of their pay, as the member for Wills is taking each week and each month in this place. They would be docked for it; they would not even hold down their jobs. If builders, retailers, teachers or nurses in the electorate of Wills had an absenteeism rate of 55 per cent, they would struggle to hold their jobs and certainly would not be receiving, at high wages, the 100 per cent of salary taken each week, each month and each year by the member for Wills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an appalling record, and it is long overdue for this House to bring the member for Wills to account for his rate of absenteeism, his appalling neglect of the electorate, his appalling contempt of this House and the people of Wills by not being here for anything more substantial than 45 per cent of divisions since the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Wills, for whom I grieve in this debate, owe it to themselves and the parliament to, at the first opportunity, elect a member who is here full time to represent their needs instead of only 45 per cent of the time. It is absolutely shameful that the member for Wills should behave with utter contempt for his electorate. He should be voted out on his appalling record of absenteeism and for the absolute contempt with which he treats his electors. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over recent years there has been increasing publicity about the kidnapping or abduction of children by parents or other family members in an endeavour to circumvent or prevent the enforcement of Family Court custody or access orders. This is an alarming and unacceptable trend and one which should and must be actively discouraged by the Australian government and our Australian courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If parents or others who are dissatisfied with custody or access orders perceive that there may be some gain in abducting or absconding with the children involved, then it stands to reason that more children will be in danger of being taken from Australia and consequently removed from the jurisdiction of the Australian courts. The widely publicised Gillespie case lends enormous weight to the urgent and, in many respects, unfulfilled need for the Australian authorities to ensure that the rights of Australian citizens are upheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I wish to bring to the attention of the House an instance where two children were wrongfully taken from Australia by their mother, who was in fact the custodial parent. This is a very complex, lengthy and difficult case and it is a considerable challenge to summarise in the brief time available to me today even the major elements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear from the outset that I do not wish to canvass the issue of whether the father should have custody of or access to the children. Legitimately, such matters should be for the Family Court of Australia to decide. However, in the case of my constituent, these decisions have been made elsewhere. I believe this is a situation which requires urgent action by the government because of the important and fundamental principles involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1991, Mr Allan Leigh, one of my constituents, was convicted of possession of an illegal weapon and sentenced to four years imprisonment. While he was in prison he appealed his conviction. The appeal was upheld. A year or so prior to Mr Leigh's conviction, his former wife, who has remarried and whom I will refer to as Mrs X, had obtained an interim order for custody of their children. At that time my constituent was given access rights. In January 1991, these access rights were suspended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the time my constituent was in gaol, Mrs X made application to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for a passport for herself and their two children. The statutory declaration she used to obtain that passport was in part untrue. I am unaware as to whether the information it contained was ever checked by the department. I do, however, believe that the fact an application had been lodged should have been made known to Mr Leigh as the father of the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1992, Mrs X sought orders in the Family Court to finalise the question of custody. The proceedings were adjourned to 3 March 1993, pending the hearing of Mr Leigh's appeal against his conviction. Unbeknown to Mr Leigh, Mrs X left Australia with the children and her husband on 1 March 1993&mdash;just two days before the Family Court was to determine the question of custody and access. Mr Leigh maintains that Mrs X was assisted in her efforts to leave Australia by certain officers of the Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1993, Mr Leigh succeeded in obtaining orders that he have access to his children, that a warrant be issued for the Australian Federal Police to take possession of the children for the purpose of access and that the Department of Social Security provide information relating to the whereabouts of the children. In August 1993, he obtained further orders that a warrant be issued to the Federal Police directing that it arrest Mrs X and bring her before the court with the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Mr Leigh was dissatisfied with the progress being made by the Federal Police, he applied to the Family Court for further orders. As a result of this application, it was suggested by the judge that my constituent subpoena the Federal Police officers concerned in the execution of the warrants. Some six hours after taking the suggested action, Mr Leigh was informed that Mrs X and the children had left Australia and that her address was unknown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The orders made in June and August 1993 were discharged in December of that year, presumably as Mrs X was no longer within the jurisdiction of the Australian Family Court. My constituent then commenced lengthy and very expensive efforts to trace Mrs X and his children's whereabouts. He eventually ascertained that they were living in the United States and he made plans to travel to America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1994, Mrs X applied to an American court for enforcement of a foreign decree of dissolution and restraining orders. Mr Leigh alleges that these proceedings were commenced after he had notified the Federal Police of Mrs X's address in America. This allegation appears to be true, as in an affidavit in support of her application she stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I recently learned of his planned trip to Washington because the Federal Police of Australia learned of it and contacted my family to warn me about it.</PARA>
<PARA>In a report she gave to the American police, which was attached to her affidavit, Mrs X reiterated this statement and named the Federal Police officer who had alerted her to her former husband's travel plans. She also stated that Melbourne police had notified her father about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, back in Australia, following an application made by Mr Leigh, Mr Justice Hase declared in orders of 17 June 1994 that the removal of the children from Australia was wrongful within the meaning of article 3 of the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Mr Leigh travelled to the United States to commence proceedings against Mrs X seeking the return to Australia of the children in accordance with the rules of the convention. The proceedings were heard in Washington in July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the American court agreed with the finding of the Australian court that the removal of the children by Mrs X was wrongful, it also found that there were compelling reasons not to return the children to Australia. Mr Leigh lodged an appeal against this decision. However, because his financial resources were exhausted, he was unable to proceed with the appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1994, Mrs X applied to an American court for orders for custody of the children. Mr Leigh was able to obtain a stay of the custody proceedings pending the decision of the Family Court in Australia as to the American court's jurisdiction to hear the matter. The costs of obtaining the stay were met by his family. However, neither my constituent nor his family had sufficient funds available to enable him to travel to America to defend the proceedings further. These proceedings were due to have been heard on 31 May 1995. I assume they have been dealt with in the absence of Mr Leigh and that the orders sought by Mrs X have been granted to her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs X had previously applied to the Family Court of Australia to have all existing proceedings in that court stayed to enable the proceedings in the American court to continue. Although she was represented, she did not personally appear at the hearing, thus avoiding any cross-examination. In February 1995, orders were made that all proceedings filed by the husband be stayed until determination of the wife's summons filed in America and that the husband shall not, without leave of the judge, file, reinstate or continue any proceeding in the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that the Australian Family Court has abrogated the responsibility of determining the question of custody and access of the Australian children to two Australian citizens to a foreign court. I find this deeply disturbing. I am very concerned that my constituent has been denied the right to appeal the decision of the American court that heard the initial proceedings in July 1994 and has not been able to contest to conclusion the issue of custody in the American court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Leigh also lodged an appeal against the decision of the Australian court to allow the American court jurisdiction in this matter. He was unable to proceed with this appeal as the costs involved were substantial and he could not obtain legal aid. How can one obtain justice if one is denied access to the courts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether Mr Leigh would be able to obtain an order for custody or even an order for access in an Australian court is not the point at issue. I believe that, as all concerned in this unhappy situation are or were at the relevant times Australians, it is an Australian court that should make the decision, not an American court. What has happened to my constituent has set a dangerous example, if not a precedent, in matters of custody and access, and something should be done about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to record my concerns about the apparent behaviour of the Federal Police in this case. I am aware that several matters are currently being investigated by the Ombudsman and I look forward to the Ombudsman's report as a matter of urgency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to relate to the House a number of events that have occurred recently in my electorate. I recently represented the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) at the opening of the refurbishment of the Cranbourne Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service office. The CRS assists people with injury or a disability to gain and keep paid employment and to live more independently in the Australian community. Injury and illness isolate a large number of Australians from the work force and the community. This represents a major cost to individuals, industry and the community as a whole, and there are real cost benefits for everyone when effective rehabilitation achieves vocational outcomes and facilitates independent participation in the community for its clients.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CRS clearly represents a continued federal government commitment to provide to people with a disability the same opportunities as any other member of Australian society. The CRS is the longest established and largest rehabilitation provider in Australia, with 33 sites in Victoria and more than 170 nationally, offering a service to customers on a local, statewide or national basis as well as establishing a reputation as a leader in the delivery of community based rehabilitation services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a cost-efficient and effective Commonwealth government organisation which has maintained a high rate of employment outcomes from vocational programs, with nearly 60 per cent of people completing these programs achieving full-time or part-time employment. A study by Anutech in 1994 of the CRS calculated that, for every $1 of taxpayers' money spent on the CRS, it saved the Australian economy $9. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The refurbishment of the Cranbourne CRS site and the subsequent formation of the South Gippsland CRS region, incorporating the CRS presence at Wonthaggi, recognise the community based aspect of CRS service provision and respond to the needs of the local community in the Cranbourne area, one of the strongest growth areas of Melbourne. Since the establishment of the CRS site in Cranbourne some three years ago, strong links have been established and maintained with a range of local community agencies in the Cranbourne area. Local employers are also increasingly realising the benefits of using CRS services and a number of businesses in the region are now customers of the Cranbourne CRS unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another event of significance that occurred recently in the local area was the opening of the extension of the electrified rail line from Dandenong through to Cranbourne. This was the first extension of the electrified lines in metropolitan Melbourne for some 20 years since the Pakenham line was opened. It represented over $27 million of federal government funds through the better cities program and led to the development of new stations at Lyndhurst, Merinda Park and Cranbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was great to see the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the electorate at the opening of the Dandenong station, but there have been a number of problems surrounding the development of this project and the actions of the state government on this issue. The state government, which has had responsibility for none of the funding provided for this project, even though it is a joint program, was in a situation whereby it slavishly and strategically attempted to dominate the publicity and to take the credit for what occurred on this occasion. Free tickets were issued to thousands of residents in the Cranbourne area. On the admission of the Victorian Minister for Public Transport, Alan Brown, this was the first time this had ever occurred. I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, wish that the state government would do something like this in the area of Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a sausage sizzle and a range of other activities on the day. There was a caravan on site staffed by PTC staff on the day and for a couple of weeks after. This is interesting because it is going to be an unstaffed station, but for the first couple of weeks I guess it is better than nothing. The stations are state of the art except for one thing&mdash;they do not have toilets. The stations are quite a walk from any toilets in the local area that could be used by people using the stations. But, despite all that, the service is proving to be a success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was urgently needed and required. It is very pleasing to be part of a federal government that was able to fund it when the state government was not prepared to do it. Two state ministers and five backbenchers attended. There was extensive media coverage of the activities of the state members under the circumstances, and some recognition of the federal government's role but not particularly from the state members involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another initiative has been the development of the Department of Social Security office and the Cranbourne CES office&mdash;both things I sought to have instigated prior to my election and subsequently followed through after my election. The CES office is now in full operation and is servicing the needs of constituents in the area. The Department of Social Security office is due to be completed and be operational within the next month. This will help provide Cranbourne with much needed services in order to build its identity and its role as a major centre within the south-eastern growth corridor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of unemployment&mdash;an issue which is of concern to all members of the House&mdash;I think we have to get it into perspective. The figures which relate to the south-eastern area of Melbourne are very important in getting it into perspective. I was elected in March 1993, and I have the figures for the March 1993 quarter and for the most recent quarter released by the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which is the December 1994 quarter, as they relate to significant elements of my electorate. I would like to read some of the figures into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the improvement that has occurred over that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployment figure for Cranbourne in the March 1993 quarter was 3,383 people, which was 8.2 per cent of the work force, and in the December 1994 quarter it was 3,008, which was 6.4 per cent of the work force&mdash;a drop of 375 people or 1.8 per cent. But over that time the labour force within Cranbourne had increased by 7,500 to 8,000 individuals. So there has been a major improvement in employment in the area. The figure for Dandenong in the December 1994 quarter was 12.4 per cent, down from 14.9 per cent in the March 1993 quarter&mdash;a drop of 818 people unemployed, which is 2.5 per cent. The figure for Springvale is down from 13.7 per cent to 12.1 per cent&mdash;a drop of 738 people on unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the rural components of my electorate, there was a major drop of 4.3 per cent in the Bass shire area, 2.3 per cent in Phillip Island and a whopping 6.8 per cent in Wonthaggi. When you add it all up, you are talking about 2,213 fewer people being unemployed in that area&mdash;a drop of 13.4 per cent in the number of unemployed over that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is a major effort. It is evidence that the government's priorities are working in an area that is depressed both rurally and in the outer industrial area of Melbourne. It is evidence that the government's policies are working and are continuing to work. It is something that the House should note. We should have more recognition from both sides of the House that we are getting it right, and we will continue to get it right in the lead-up to the next election. </PARA>

Just to conclude on the point of these allegations against Mr Costello, Mr Mark Leibler is also mentioned in the member for Deakin's remarks. Mr Costello says that Mr Leibler has contacted him to say that he has publicly rejected to the press the allegations which were made against him, and Mr Leibler reminded him that this was not the first occasion on which he had been the subject of attack by Mr Aldred, the last occasion being before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts over tax matters, and in that connection Mr Leibler says that the bipartisan report of that committee fully vindicated his position and rejected Mr Aldred's.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can report that the AFP investigations found that allegations concerning any officer or officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have not substantiated any criminal activity either in Australia or in the Philippines where some of these allegations were made. The internal investigation is continuing to see whether there has been conduct which could be subject to disciplinary provisions. It is not appropriate to comment until that investigation is complete, but when it is complete it will put the department in a better position to clear the reputations of those officers concerned. </PARA>

<PARA>This bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the loan fund rather than the consolidated revenue fund and to supplement the moneys available to the consolidated revenue fund. Legally, expenditure from the consolidated revenue fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that fund. Successive governments have adopted the practice of introducing a loan bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the loan fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the parliament but for which insufficient funds are available in the consolidated revenue fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund. While the budget as a whole is anticipated to be in surplus in 1995-96, there is a prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund of about $2.1 billion. The difference between the two estimated outcomes arises because appropriations from the CRF include various items which are functionally classified as financing transactions rather than outlays, and thus do not affect the budget outcome. These items include superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides authority for the loan fund to meet defence expenditures incurred in 1995-96 after the passage of the bill that would otherwise have been met from the consolidated revenue fund and, if necessary, to supplement the consolidated revenue fund so that it can meet its other commitments.

Legally, payments from the consolidated revenue fund cannot exceed moneys available to that fund. In order to meet any prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund it is customary to seek legislative authority to charge defence and other consolidated revenue fund expenditure to, or reimburse the consolidated revenue fund from, the Loan Fund. The bill provides authority to charge the loan fund defence expenditures which would otherwise be met from the consolidated revenue fund and to reimburse the consolidated revenue fund from the Loan Fund for certain non-defence expenditures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does not in any way limit parliament's prerogative to appropriate public moneys but simply provides a mechanism for financing expenditures previously approved and appropriated by parliament. This is a normal procedure for financing consolidated revenue fund deficits and has been used by successive governments over many years. The coalition notes that there will not be any financial implications flowing from this legislation other than a small amount of expense stemming from raising the loans under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Commonwealth is again seeking to borrow should be of no surprise to anyone. Racking up debt is a trademark of this government. Commonwealth public debt interest increased from $7,106.8 million in 1994-95 to now stand at $9,387.5 million in 1996-97 and it will increase again to $9,470.2 million in that year. This is in stark comparison to the states, which will see their public debt interest decline from $1,118.7 million in 1994-95 to $648.6 million in 1996-97. What a difference a move to Liberal governments around Australia has made to the debt outlook of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comparison with the Commonwealth is a stark contrast and is not favourable. The simple fact is this: the Keating Labor government cannot manage its finances. The result has been an explosion in Commonwealth debt. Australia will be a long time paying for this. The $9.4 billion we will pay this year for public debt interest is not going to hospitals, it is not going to roads and it is not going to provide Australians with any of the tax cuts they were promised; it is going to the financial markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians will be getting no benefit for the over $9 billion worth of their hard-earned tax dollars because it is going straight to the banks. But this situation is of even more concern when you realise that we are now on a downward economic cycle. It is normal in business and in households to use the good times to retire debt, but the government will have nothing of such a tradition. It goes on racking up debt during the good times. Even when growth is strong and employment is expanding, and there is no self-evident need for a fiscal stimulus, this government goes on spending and racking up more debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government can talk about economic nirvana all it likes, but the truth is that we will go into the next period of low growth or downturn not having made any inroads into debt whatsoever. Sustained levels of solid growth are undoubtedly fundamental to this government meeting its forecast for the small surpluses in the out years. If that growth does not come through, the Commonwealth will not achieve those surpluses on the current settings. That means that we will continue to rack up even more debt and more debt interest. That will be the legacy of this Keating government&mdash;an ever increasing mountain of debt and higher debt repayments. Cain and Kirner did it in Victoria and now Paul Keating is trying it here. Members will also recall the other similarities between Prime Minister Keating and Premier Kirner. Both sold off their banks to try to fudge it and improve the bottom line. The situation has come about because the government cannot control its spending. Even in this budget, spending increased by 1.7 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's negligence has other ramifications for Australia. Foreign debt is one of the great policy problems for Australia and this government's insistence on running budget deficits has been exacerbated through the Commonwealth's borrowing overseas. The government has been incapable of limiting the growth of its own debt or the national debt. The task before the government was to structurally reduce the deficit, lift savings and begin to work on reducing debt. The government failed in this task. Given the enormous growth in spending, that is where the government should focus its efforts. Instead, it cut net expenditure by a pilfering $700 million and lifted taxes by $2.3 billion in 1995-96. The rest was made up by asset sales and gimmicks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government made a big noise about cutting back on spending but, at the end of the day, it did not have the nerve to carry it through. This is where the Commonwealth debt problem is coming from&mdash;too much spending. The government tells everyone else that they need to pull their belts in for just a little while to achieve the economic nirvana that it promised, but it is are not prepared to do it itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even last week we found more evidence of this. Two Auditor-General's reports highlighted the incompetence of this government. One report showed that seven per cent of the Commonwealth's work force, or 10,000 officers, were non-operational and one showed that the tax office failed to collect $50 million in tax due. One officer was absent for 20 years. Just what is going on in this government? It does not know what is happening in its work force and the tax office cannot even collect the taxes it is supposed to. Yet the government expects Australian people to believe that this budget has spending as tight as it can be and there is a need to lift revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has run out of solutions and now is engaging in gimmicks. All the little one-off gimmicks and asset sales will not be there next year so they cannot be considered structural improvements to the budget. There is no solution in this budget. This was a budget to get the Keating government to the next election. That is all. In fact, the only decision it did make was to impose further taxes on the Australian people. Revenue changes announced in this budget will add $2.4 billion in tax this year, raising $7.8 billion extra tax in 1998-99. The ALP does not know how to deal with spending and the enormous growth in debt, but make no mistake&mdash;cutting spending and lifting savings can be done in the Australian context. Victoria, for one, has shown that a financial situation can be retrieved if the hard decisions are made. Despite the best efforts of the ALP administration to bankrupt that state, Premier Kennett has done a magnificent job in reopening Victoria for business and reducing the state debt burden. Premier Kennett has been busy improving Victoria's position at the same time as the Prime Minister has been busy running up larger and larger amounts of Commonwealth debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is still at it. Within one week of bringing down a phoney surplus, the Prime Minister was out there spending it with election promises to build yet another road and extend runways. This man has not stopped spending. He has not got the will to do it. This will feed through to higher borrowings. As far as he is concerned, if there are votes out there to buy, he will do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia must get its debt under control or we will pass to our children a terrible legacy. The coalition is quite clear in its commitment to the Australian people. We will not lift taxes and we will control spending. All areas of spending will be put through detailed assessment and examination. If there is not a clear purpose and a clear benefit to the Australian people, the expenditure will stop. The budget papers will not hide or distort the true situation. Commonwealth own purpose outlays will be revealed so that the government cannot just cut payments to the states and then claim fiscal rectitude when it is the states that are doing the hard work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has manifestly failed across a wide range of fronts. It has failed to bring down a credible budget and to make some meaningful effort to tackle the problem of debt. It has failed to tackle the question of its own spending. Instead, it has resorted to gimmicks and higher taxes. This government has run out of ideas and energy. It now clings to power merely by the sake of being in power.

It is ridiculous to sell our assets and plough the proceeds into consolidated revenue, into recurrent spending and into consumption spending by the government in the way that this government is now doing. The states are leading the way. They are setting the example which this government might very well follow. They mostly use their privatisation proceeds to retire debt, and one can substitute `asset sales' for `privatisation'. This lowers the cost of servicing debt which in turn contributes to the attainment of an even better fiscal outcome. That is what the states are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proceeds of any sale of assets should go to retiring debt and no assets should be sold until we have a real, not a smoke and mirrors, budget surplus. Labor's asset sales, as members opposite know only too well in their heart of hearts, do absolutely nothing to reduce debt and are therefore analogous to throwing your money down the drain. This combination of deceit and gross fiscal mismanagement is becoming a familiar concoction overutilised by this Labor regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, the government has to make provisions to fund this insidious shortfall, and this bill is just one of many such measures. Much of the deficit will be funded by tax increases, which are nothing more than income tax stolen back post the 1993 election. Our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is the Indian giver of Prime Ministers. He promises legislated tax cuts just to win government and then, having achieved this objective, snatches them back.

<PARA>Perhaps we will have an end to these New Zealand jokes that we love to peddle around this country. We could learn a great deal from them. In terms of fiscal responsibility, we are the laughing joke of this part of the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Australian government had been prepared to make the hard decisions and implement fiscal policy like New Zealand, we too would now be reaping the rewards of budget surpluses that could be used to deliver tax cuts to low and middle income earners as well as reductions in our level of debt. Instead, the budget imposes tax hikes that strike at the very heart of middle Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget surplus handed down by the New Zealand government on 1 June came as no surprise. With the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994 in New Zealand, a budget policy statement fully costed must be released to accompany the budget itself. Would it not be just great if that could happen in Australia? All fiscal policies must be costed and available for scrutiny by the parliament before a budget is handed down. Anything that involves scrutiny by the parliament is anathema to this mob. It is unimaginable that this government would ever adopt such a strategy for open and honest fiscal policy because, if it did, it would be shown up for what it really is: a government that hides the reality of overspending behind shonky budget figures and false surpluses with real underlying deficits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is why the coalition is committed to the charter of budget honesty. I know the word `honesty' does not fit well within the lexicon of our Prime Minister and his government. But that is probably a reason why the Australian people may be persuaded to forget the deficiencies of this failed Prime Minister, this full-time emperor. We need a formal commitment to a long-term budgetary surplus to reverse the recent explosion in Commonwealth debt. This must be backed by honest indications as to how such a stipulated outcome can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also require adequate budgetary information to assess our progress towards stated goals. However, before we can undertake our charter of budget honesty we need to accurately know what the state of the Commonwealth's finances really are. We do not know what they are from this regime. This will be accomplished by the establishment of a commission of audit. This commission, after the next election, will examine and report to the government on the real financial position of the Commonwealth, especially its indebtedness. Bodies like our proposed commission have been used effectively in several states in the last three years after state governments were tossed out of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our aim is a structural budget surplus and contained and falling levels of public sector debt. In New Zealand, budget surpluses have enabled drastic debt reduction. Net foreign debt in that country is set to be wiped out in the coming years, while in Australia it continues to grow and at a quickening pace. In New Zealand in 1992-93, net public debt was almost $NZ40 billion, which was 47.45 per cent of gross domestic product. It is forecast to fall to 32.1 per cent of GDP in 1995-96 and will continue to fall at least until 1997-98 when it is projected to be only 18.7 per cent of gross domestic product, which is below $NZ20 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surpluses the size of New Zealand's&mdash;seven per cent of GDP over the next three years&mdash;would, if adopted by Labor in Australia, present opportunities for very limited increases in expenditure designed to build growth and equity, but would be limited to that alone. What we have to look forward to in Australia is quite the reverse. We have a burgeoning level of net foreign debt, which is only anticipated to increase further. Our total public sector level of debt is in the order of 37.5 per cent, which is where New Zealand was in 1992-93. The Commonwealth's level of public sector debt, as a proportion of gross domestic product, is around 18 per cent, but you need to include the states to give a true comparison, but this government does not want to do that. To state the obvious, we are a federation and New Zealand is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from the tax fraud perpetrated by Labor, there is the selling off of government assets. Let it be remembered that these asset sales are final and are an unsustainable way of balancing the books. You cannot do it year after year; you can only sell them once. We have a country with national assets that are being chipped away to fund a Labor regime that spends well beyond its means. There is no long-term planning in this strategy. It is not really a strategy; it is a tactic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is yet another quick fix solution to win another term in government. This will only continue the cycle of broken promises, lies and asset sales, and all for nothing as the structural deficit continues unaddressed.

Unfortunately for them they will not have any assets to sell the way we are going to. </PARA>

The OECD's 1995 report on Australia makes it clear that the Commonwealth if it wants to increase public savings on a long-term basis will need to cut its structural budget deficit. That is as plain as day. Even our illiterate Prime Minister can understand that. Obviously, it has only two ways of achieving such an outcome. It can cut expenditure or it can raise taxes, or even a combination of the two. There could be a third&mdash;and it has not resiled from using it&mdash;and that is to borrow more money as long as there are enough suckers overseas to lend it to us when we have the balance sheets we have in this country after 13 Labor budgets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has gone hard and fast for the option of increasing taxes; the very thing it promised not to do. We are all getting sick of saying it but we do remember the l-a-w, pronounced `lie', tax cuts in the run-up to the 1993 election. We all know what has happened since. This government has not got the guts to cut its own recurrent outlays where trimming is most urgently required. It is regrettable that Labor cannot come clean and confront its errors so that they can be rectified with sensible long-term solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister goes and preaches to the Japanese that they should apologise for the atrocities of the Second World War and the atrocities that ensued. In a way, I agree with him. But he cannot admit his own errors. He cannot admit his own fiscal atrocities in 12 or 13 Labor budgets, yet he goes preaching to the Japanese about what they should do. It is all wearing pretty thin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving our total government sector into budgetary surplus is also the only way of moving our balance of payments around and starting to pay our way after a long absence of not paying our way in the world.

That something is a radical rethink of all government policy, including fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, individual Australians are being castigated for a poor national savings outcome. God bless us. This is a bit rich given the government's profligate example and the lack of incentives to save through the imposition of unfair taxation. Is it any wonder that our private sector's national savings record is so abysmal when the Australian government imposes the highest effective tax rates on voluntary savings in the OECD of around 60 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Managing Director of the National Australia Bank, Mr Don Argus, in his address to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in February, isolated the increase in burden of government regulation of small business as a major impediment to expansion. Amen to that. Instead of lowering the costs of doing business in this country, excessive Labor governmental tax regulation imposes increasing real costs on small to medium sized businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Argus cited an example of a small to medium business with annual turnover of around $1 million that could expect to confront 80 separate forms requiring over 500 hours of data collection and 100 hours of external advice. Is it any wonder that the cost of compliance continues to have a dampening effect on the spirit of innovation and competitiveness of small businesses in this otherwise great country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the rise in company tax of three per cent and the negative effects this will have on business. Will businesses be forced to put up prices, or cut costs by laying off staff? Increasing tax burdens have a crippling effect on small businesses at a time when the government informs us that unemployment figures are falling and that our economy is booming. Public sector debt and the interest payments on that debt continue to grow concurrently. This is a government which has an awful habit of crushing small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's attitude is simple. If you cannot absorb the higher taxes and charges, the administrative overload, the uncertainty of government policy and the like, then you should quit your business and become a PAYE employee. That is the attitude of our Prime Minister. It is easier for all concerned, though there is a slight hitch: there will be no new jobs because it is the small business sector which creates the overwhelming majority of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to fiscal policy, Mr Don Argus stated prior to the delivery of the budget that national savings can be increased by a combination of increased private sector and/or public savings. Realistically, however, as pointed out by Vince FitzGerald among others, in the near term public savings will need to do most of the work. Hence, the need for a budget surplus built not upon cyclical factors, but upon a firm policy of tightening the fiscal process to achieve a real and sustainable structural surplus. Mr Argus went on to point out that this should be achieved predominantly by slashing expenditure and not increasing taxes. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently conducted a survey of all businesses within my electorate. I do not know the political views of the small businesses in the electorate of Mitchell&mdash;there are about 4,000 of them. I listed a number of issues that I thought may be of concern to them and asked them to rank them. I then asked them to state on the blank pages other matters that would be of concern to them when operating a business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business is the key economic factor in providing jobs in the electorate of Mitchell. I suspect that that is the case in most electorates. In most electorates around Australia small to medium businesses&mdash;it does not matter whether it is a retail, wholesale or agricultural production business or whether it is related to the building industry or to manufacturing industries&mdash;are the very backbone of job opportunities for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I prepared this survey for about 4,000 businesses in the electorate of Mitchell, I asked them to tell me what they considered to be the greater impediments to profitability and to providing jobs. It might interest the House that some of the economic settings of this government and its borrowing regime, and the perilous situation it has put small business in, is really one of the factors that the people are going to take into account as they come up to an election. That is one of the reasons why I do not hesitate to read the weekend comments of Roger Douglas. As he said, `Australia is living in fantasy land if it believes it can enter</PARA>
<PARA>the 21st century without major economic reform.' These job providers&mdash;and they are mum and dad businesses with their children working for them&mdash;told me in this survey what they felt about their future and about what Australian governments needed to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response rate to the survey was about 12 per cent, which is a very high response rate. They were anonymous replies if they sought to be anonymous. But, above everything else, the cost of government administration was the thing that disturbed them the most. Almost half of the business community said that the time spent on government administration was their biggest worry because it was something they had to do after hours when they were tired&mdash;and they have been forced into servicing the community for longer and longer hours&mdash;without paid professional help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of that administration also rated very highly. I asked them to rate both the cost factor and the time factor to them as a business. I wish to relate to the House that the impost of this government on the time of small business, and the time and energy of people who were productive and job providers, was the most significant thing that it has imposed over the last 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One had only to look at the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) the other night when he brought into the House the tax act to see a practical demonstration of how things have changed in this regard and to see the impact that the government's administration has had on small business. The tax act in 1983 was barely two inches thick. It is now six inches thick. You have increased the amount of words and the complexity of the process just in one act alone by approximately 200 per cent. If you are going to measure it by bulk, that is what you have imposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, the government has imposed a capital gains tax regime, a fringe benefits tax regime and an enterprise wage bargaining process that few of them understand. It has imposed changes to sales tax instead of simplifications. It has imposed a superannuation levy. On top of that, there are state taxes. On top of that, small businesses have to cope with increasing crime and vandalism. The government has an indexed fuel tax. It has unfair dismissal legislation. It has shipping costs and wharfage processes that small businesses do not understand, and it has commercial interest rates going through the roof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time this government is seeking to generate economic activity, it has increased by multiple ratios the complexity that small businesses have to confront when they want to&mdash;and when they are forced by law to&mdash;administer government programs and government requirements. By law, they must do it. The biggest complaint from the small business community in Mitchell&mdash;all of the businesses had a chance to participate in the survey&mdash;overwhelmingly was that the cost and time spent on government administration was the greatest detriment to providing jobs and profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What else did the small businesses say was of significance to them? They said generally that the second most significant thing that prevented them from being profitable and putting on additional people was the fringe benefits tax. Not only was it expensive in terms of time, but it was costly to their business. The theme in the responses from the small businesses of Mitchell was, `Don't put taxes like that on us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third most significant thing that the small business community in Mitchell said was an impediment to employment and profitability was the superannuation levy. That is another new tax imposed by the current government. The fourth most significant feature of their concern was commercial interest rates. So the rising cost of interest rates ranks with the cost of administration, the fringe benefits tax and the superannuation levy as the four most significant things that this government has imposed on small businesses in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were many other features that the small business proprietors of Mitchell were asked about. They were asked about capital gains taxes, enterprise and wage bargaining, sales taxes, state payroll taxes, state land taxes, the foreign debt, unemployment, crime and vandalism, fuel taxes, unfair dismissal, shipping costs and anything else they wanted to mention. But the top four were all Labor Party initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what the proprietors have said to the government as a political party, but the government will remain basically deaf because I do not think anybody within the Australian Labor Party&mdash;or very few&mdash;have worked in the real world. Very few have held jobs in private enterprises. Very few have worked for themselves. Most of the government members have come through academic or union avenues. We only have to look at the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Bankstown boy. He has not worked in Bankstown in his life. He thinks, from the distance of the Lodge and overseas, that he has the capacity to understand the battlers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am talking about the small business battlers of Australia. They are saying to the Australian Labor Party&mdash;and to the coalition as well&mdash;`We don't like the cost of administration that you have put on us. We don't like the fringe benefits tax. We don't like the superannuation levy, and we don't like what you are doing to commercial interest rates.' Broadly, that is what was said in the survey conducted of small businesses in the electorate of Mitchell, which is in the hills district of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These small business people then wrote to me with their comments. Some of their comments are of interest to the House. I owe the business people of Mitchell the opportunity of having their comments to the government and the coalition recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. We ought to be using these real people&mdash;the real workers and the real battlers&mdash;as some sort of yardstick. The proprietor of a building company said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small business employs more people in total than any other businesses. Every effort must be made by government to reduce non-essential paperwork, administration cost and encourage this sector.</PARA>
<PARA>That is great commonsense from that proprietor. A business proprietor in the sports and leisure industry in the Annangrove district said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to solve unemployment and make business profitable, Government has to provide incentive for hardworking people and penalise lazy people. Not as at present time penalise hard working, 140 hours per week and support bludgers, greedy banks and exporting raw materials and importing finished products which could be manufactured in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>They are pretty blunt comments from a pretty good `Aussie'. These are the sorts of comments that small businesses are making to us as a parliament. As we proceed with the passage of the budget bills, the Australian Labor Party has said, `We don't care, because this is as good as it gets.' It has said to the business people and the small business employers of Australia, `It doesn't get better than this.' These are the words of the Prime Minister. If the small business community hoped to be able to employ more people or expand, they should forget it because the Prime Minister says it is not going to get better than this. I will read more comments from the business people. A small company in Baulkham Hills said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like the broken record that I am, things will be great if Government would just get out of business.</PARA>
<PARA>A Carlingford business said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am for once not able to make a decision. How can small business gamble to employ some person who may prove unsuitable then cost time and funds to dismiss? Tax. Far too many taxes. Apart from escalating costs, too much time are involved with records. The individual has to be responsible for providing for holidays, retirement, taxes, performance of quality work at work. These should not be like a gun held to the head of the employer.</PARA>
<PARA>What else did the small business people in the Mitchell electorate have to say in response to my survey? They had comments of great interest about a range of subjects, and all in tune with what Roger Douglas said. These are all commonsense, practical, public people, running `mum and dad businesses' who wrote down what they felt should happen to Australia. They were in absolute opposition to the policies presented in the last budget of the Australian Labor Party, but in accord, in their own way, with what Roger Douglas said about Australia: we have to get our act together. An airconditioning business from the Dural district said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Banks are also making it hard for small business by stopping cheques if your overdraft exceeds the limit, regardless if you have the ample security plus many debtors.</PARA>
<PARA>Here are some comments from a Castle Hill business:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Penalty rates of pay are unfair impost on retailers who are forced to trade seven days a week. Also there are too many government decreed additional holidays to provide workers with long weekends. Holidays should be taken on the day public holidays fall and not extended at employers' cost.</PARA>
<PARA>Another business said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for the trouble you've gone to send me this questionnaire. Medical practices are small businesses for a taxation and industrial relations viewpoint, although people forget that sometimes. Please do what you can to get back into the political fight before Labor swamps us.</PARA>
<PARA>We have done that. Another business in the North Rocks area said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfair dismissal legislation could ruin a service industry not being able to dismiss unsuitable staff. Superannuation levy for part-time employees is unfair to the employer and employees, as contributions will be consumed by costs and fees. Fringe benefits tax&mdash;an impediment to employment. For example, restaurants, car sales and manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA>Here is another example from Baulkham Hills. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present political correctness program is not going to benefit the genuine Australia and without doubt we will end up just like the USA&mdash;that is, racial ghettos or no-go areas in our cities.</PARA>
<PARA>Another example from the Box Hill area states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a self-employed person and would not take on school leavers even as casuals under today's conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>And so I conclude my remarks, Mr Speaker. I am pleased to see you in the chair because I know that you are a man who understands about the battlers of Australia. It is a pity you were not a minister in order to make a bigger impact on government policy. </PARA>

For some time the delicate ecosystem that makes up Adelaide's much loved River Torrens has been ravaged by the chemical, oil and bacterial pollution resulting from the activities taking place in its catchment area. To highlight the need for action to stop the degradation of the river, I organised a community clean-up in January of this year.

For more than 30 years until the mid-1980s part of Australian National's rail yards were used for dumping of waste materials such as asbestos, sulfuric acid, cyanide, pesticide and engine oil. This material was never safely disposed of and, at the time residents contacted my office for help, there was a danger that Australian National was about to disturb the site and endanger the health of those living in the area. In cooperation, the residents of Kilburn and I were able to focus media attention on the waste disposal site, and we are persisting in our efforts to force the Commonwealth to take responsibility for the clean-up of the environmental minefield sitting in Kilburn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that individuals can do much to ensure that our environment is preserved and enhanced, there must be no leeway given to governments to use this as an alibi for their own inaction. There must be a more principled, less opportunistic response to the environmental challenge and policy moves like the recent turnaround by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the question of encouraging the use of unleaded petrol must become a thing of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under cover of the fanfare and rhetoric surrounding the announcement of a number of environmental spending initiatives in the budget, the sales tax on new cars was increased to 21 per cent. This added about $1,000 to the cost of a new car and will price many people out of the new car market. The environmental cost of upping the tax on new cars&mdash;that is, the cars that run on unleaded fuel&mdash;was acknowledged by the Prime Minister in early 1992 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From tomorrow, the sales tax on new cars . . . will be permanently lowered to 15% . . . with cheaper cars, we will drive newer cars, which is good for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA>I would argue that the level of lead in our environment remains a major issue which we must confront, and that what was good for the environment in 1992 remains good for the environment today. As I said, I believe we are capable of meeting the environmental challenge that faces us, but we must find the depth of commitment to match the enormity of the task. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, last week, on the adjournment debate, I referred to the closure of the Commonwealth Bank at Weipa on the western side of the Cape York Peninsula in my electorate. Tonight I want to talk about the problem of prices in remote communities in the north of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prices surveys carried out by the Queensland government regularly reveal that Weipa and Thursday Island in my electorate are by far the most expensive places in Queensland in which to live. My office recently started coordinating price watch surveys in Weipa, whereby each month the price of a standard basket of goods is recorded not only in Weipa but in several Far North Queensland supermarkets. It soon became apparent that the Weipa Woolworths was blowing out the average price recorded at other Far North Queensland supermarkets. Weipa's food basket was consistently priced at about $16 more than comparable baskets from Cairns supermarkets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Weipa is isolated but I do not believe that Woolworths can justify this type of price increase. After all, it is one of Australia's largest food chains. This is the only major supermarket in the area and services Weipa as well as the Napranum and Mapoon communities. I will be writing to the manager of Woolworths to seek some sort of clarification and justification for its pricing policies in Weipa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will also be writing to the Prices Surveillance Authority. I would like to see more vigilance with respect to remote area supermarkets and prices. Thursday Island in the Torres Strait in my electorate is another place where prices are particularly high. I understand how difficult it is for places in the Torres Strait to get food and that transport costs are considerable but there has to be some equity between prices for people living in remote areas and people living in urban centres. Simple things such as the weekly food shopping should not be so economically prohibitive that people are unable to live in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Petrol pricing is one of the most obvious blatant abuses in price setting. It is interesting to note that the Indonesian petrol tankers come into Weipa before going around the Cape York Peninsula to Cairns; nevertheless, prices for petrol are often 10c or more a litre higher in Weipa than in Cairns. That is why there has to be some sort of inquiry into the situation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make sure that prices in these areas are regularly monitored to ensure that transport costs only are considered in setting price differences and that the sometimes exorbitant margins are not simply the result of petrol retailers and supermarkets taking advantage of a monopoly position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in remote areas realise that they have to pay more for their goods in supermarkets than people pay in supermarkets in capital cities and major regional cities, such as Cairns. But, in the 1990s, prices in remote areas should be going down with the improvement in roads and the technological change that is bringing all of us together. State and Commonwealth governments together should continue to monitor this situation. I will be raising the matter at every opportunity until we get a situation where there is not what appears to be a massive rip-off of people living in remote communities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I want to briefly touch on some remarks made by a colleague of mine from Western Australia, Senator Crichton-Browne, in the estimates hearings last Friday. Not only are they manifestly wrong but also they are known to be wrong and, as such, require correction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, as part of his comments at the estimates hearings, Senator Crichton-Browne, as he has done publicly on a number of occasions, claimed that in 1991, in the process of preselection for Moore, he saved my preselection. That is, notwithstanding the fact that he is not a powerbroker, has no influence and is just a humble servant of the party, he somehow managed to save my preselection, influencing people to vote for me who might not otherwise have done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made this point publicly and on the Ron Edwards program on radio 6PR, so it is not necessary to make it under privilege. All Senator Crichton-Browne, or anybody, has to do is speak to the then chairman of the preselection committee for the Liberal Party, Mr Eric Bingley, and he will put them straight. He would quite openly inform them that my preselection win in 1991 was quite a comfortable one and certainly would not have been determined at all by anybody who would have been influenced by Senator Crichton-Browne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crichton-Browne then went on to say that five people were influenced and that they would have had an influence over the preselection. There were, in fact, five delegates from the state council. On the Ron Edwards program Senator Crichton-Browne mentioned that they were the people he managed to influence. One of them was the chairman of the preselection committee himself, who I do not think would have been influenced in a thousand years by what Senator Crichton-Browne had to say to him. Three of the other people in that group probably would have been highly insulted if they thought they were mere lackeys or robots or acted in a robotic way as a result of comments made by Senator Crichton-Browne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, Senator Crichton-Browne rang me once to put this point to me and I asked him, `If you say you managed to influence this particular event back in 1991, tell me exactly whose mind you managed to change.' He said, `I'm not playing that silly game.' I said, `I'm pressing you. Tell me who it was.' He then mentioned these so-called state councillors to whom I have just referred. Not only is what Senator Crichton-Browne saying not true, but he has been peddling this particular line for some time and I believe he knows it is not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to his estimates committee appearance, Senator Crichton-Browne made some remarks in relation to the preselection for 1995. He claims that he had no role to play in the influencing of delegates, that somehow this happened by osmosis, that he had no particular influential participation. As his alibi, he has had the state president of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, Mr Honey, say that he had contacted 10 of the 16 branch presidents in the electorate to ask them whether Senator Crichton-Browne had ever contacted them or appeared at the branch to influence their delegates. As I also mentioned on the Ron Edwards program on 6PR, that also is a bit of a furphy. The reason for this is that, in the first instance, it would not be necessary to physically appear and make a personal intervention in those particular branches. It would perhaps be sufficient to ring influential key people and ask them to effect his particular objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the people that I believe had been involved in that was the highly malleable member for Wanneroo, Mr Wayde Smith, who in fact said to me last August at a branch function that he had received a call from Senator Crichton-Browne, who had said to him that I had got too much influence in the branches and that Mr Smith ought to sort it out, otherwise he would get a kick in the backside. Obviously, operating through malleable proxies like Mr Smith is a highly effective way, if Mr Smith has influence in those branches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point Senator Crichton-Browne raised was that I had deliberately sabotaged my preselection so that I could win the appeal. That is a rather intriguing and ingenious suggestion. That is interesting, considering that part of that preselection appeal process involved nine people whose applications turned up at one particular branch with manifestly false addresses. Presumably he is saying that I sent them along to deliberately sabotage the preselection when in fact they returned to the sponsor to obtain correct addresses. Senator Crichton-Browne then used them as a reason for creating a new branch at the state executive. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, if you were fascinated by the contribution of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), then stay tuned because I would like to make some more general points about this matter. What does the sacking of the honourable member for Moore by the Western Australian Liberal Party mean? I start with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> of 21 May 1995 which carried a headline `Filing dumped again'. This refers to the unfortunate lack of success by the member for Moore with his appeal to the Liberal Party state council in Western Australia and postulates the member for Moore running as an Independent or as a National Party candidate at the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are very intrigued with the internecine machinations that the honourable member for Moore gave a short time ago, what does this mean for the Western Australian Liberal Party on a grand scale?

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I see people like Paul Filing who is again a classic conservative West Australian states righter, a person of it seems to me impeccable credentials and when I see him under threat and under attack I wonder what in the world is going on . . .</PARA>
<PARA>On the Channel 9 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on 9 April, in an interview with Laurie Oakes, the member for Moore tells us about the Western Australian Liberal Party:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . basically it starts eating itself.</PARA>
<PARA>Laurie Oakes says to him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You lost your preselection despite an endorsement from John Howard. Alan Rocher a couple of weeks ago lost his preselection, despite a strong endorsement from John Howard. Your leader's endorsement is not worth much at all, is it?</PARA>
<PARA>It is a very prescient question. The honourable member for Moore responds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's a bit strange when the party over here whacks him around the ear and then says they support him 100 per cent. I just find that a bit of a strange way to show support.</PARA>
<PARA>Laurie Oakes asks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you expect John Howard now to act to try to save you?</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Moore responds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John has been, I think, showing tremendous leadership but in this particular instance it is limited . . .</PARA>
<PARA>What does this episode show about the Western Australian Liberal Party? Disunity, vicious internal fighting and a lack of leadership. That results in the point that we have been making all week: when you have disunity, infighting and no leadership, you end up with no policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On 24 May, the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> summed up many of these points. The heading `WA Liberals mess it up again' is somewhat of an understatement. The editorial states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal Party in WA seems to have an extraordinary capacity for political perversity.</PARA>
<PARA>It mentions `a bitter factional battle' and `vicious infighting'. In the body of the editorial, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Liberals are again showing voters the deep divisions that persist in the party. The political maxim that disunity is death is a lesson WA Liberals refuse to learn.</PARA>
<PARA>For a new angle, the editorial further states:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Moore result is the latest in a long series of incidents that suggest Liberal faction leaders are more intent on retaining their narrow internal power bases . . .</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking about political perversity, I will finish with a particular Western Australian Liberal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This week sees the publication of a book that will shortly be well known to many Australians, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Hoser Files</EMPHASIS>. In it author Raymond Hoser, who has been a taxi driver in Melbourne from late 1985 until the present day, details his continuing and often frustrating fight against official harassment and corruption. Raymond Hoser previously wrote a best seller, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Smuggled&mdash;the underground trade in Australian wildlife</EMPHASIS>, which dramatically exposed numerous illegal activities by officers of the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service, the NPWS. These illegal activities, in Hoser's own words, `included wildlife trafficking, murder, bashing, phone tapping, arson, court fixing and other types of corruption'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following its release in May 1993, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Smuggled</EMPHASIS> was illegally banned by NPWS until the then minister, Chris Hartcher, stepped in a month later and ordered the lifting of the ban. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Smuggled</EMPHASIS>, and the valuable work Raymond Hoser did prior to its release, did cause the last state coalition government in New South Wales to initiate a major clean up of the department. This included the purging of several senior NPWS officials. Hopefully, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Hoser Files</EMPHASIS> will bring about a similar cleansing effect on certain elements of the bureaucracy in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hoser especially documents the all too frequent harassment of taxi drivers, including himself, by particular enforcement officers of Vicroads. Vicroads, known as the Road Traffic Authority prior to 1989, has regulatory responsibility in Victoria for the taxi industry. According to Hoser, multiple hiring, though quite legal in Victoria for many years, was a common catalyst for intimidatory behaviour by some Vicroads officials towards taxi drivers. To quote Hoser:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Multiple hiring is when a taxi driver takes more than one fare at a time and charges each fare separately. This occurs when there are more people waiting for taxis than there are taxis available.</PARA>
<PARA>As Hoser points out, it is `highly profitable' for drivers and for passengers&mdash;`It is often the only means of getting a taxi to their destination'. These considerations, plus the clear legality of multiple hiring, makes the behaviour of Vicroads all the more irrational. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another key area where taxi drivers are hard hit is fare evasion. Until I read this book, I personally had no idea how vulnerable taxi drivers were to this abuse and how extraordinarily widespread it is. Again, I quote Hoser direct:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fare evasion, although a problem faced by taxi drivers everywhere, seemed worse in Victoria. In fact, in my first shift driving a taxi in Melbourne, three people tried to avoid paying the fare.</PARA>
<PARA>Worse still was the complete inaction of some Victoria Police officers in dealing with the problem, even when precise details of the individuals and circumstances involved were provided or, more incredibly, when the offender was actually handed over to the police by a driver. It is understandable that a busy Victoria Police force may regard taxi fare evasion as a low priority, but it is no small matter to the taxi drivers affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second half of Hoser's book centres on his continually thwarted attempts to rectify these and other abuses in the taxi industry, with Vicroads management, Victoria Police internal investigations, the ombudsman's office, the courts and other avenues of appeal. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Hoser Files</EMPHASIS> is a book that was well worth writing and is compelling reading. It must be the basis for vigorous reforms in Vicroads regulation of the taxi industry and more effective handling of legitimate grievances of Victoria's taxi drivers. I have here a copy of the book, which I have shown the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table. I seek leave to table the book, as it is being released this week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, like your good self, was fascinated by the machinations of the Moore electorate council. Prior to the election before last, I was visited by a delegation of Young Liberals who sought my help in overthrowing the member for Moore (Mr Filing). They detailed all his crimes&mdash;and I am sure that they were absolutely right about them&mdash;but I had to explain to them that my interests were in their continuing to fight and they could expect no help from me. They left saying that they thought they had the numbers anyway. They clearly did not, but the campaign continued. It is all very interesting. I suggest the member for Moore write a book. I am sure we would all like to know more about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say something in defence of Senator Crichton-Browne. During the problems we had in Western Australia with the so-called WA Inc., Senator Crichton-Browne said to me, `You'll never hear a peep out of me about WA Inc., because in my view the government will be the last to know and under the circumstances any government would do the same. If it happened again, the government will do it again.' Of course he was absolutely right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time later we had problems with the Albany cannery and the Court government bailed out the cannery. In fact, it was far worse than anything that had happened under WA Inc. After $30 million or $40 million of inquiry, the royal commission said that there was no corruption in Western Australia. That was the finding of the royal commission which was set up specifically to find corruption, and it could not find it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Albany cannery, the Court government did bail it out. The interesting thing was that the creditors, who were the shareholders, were also members of the Liberal Party. As Senator Crichton-Browne said, if it happens in the future, governments will do it again. Senator Crichton-Browne has kept his word. No matter how much scorn and abuse is heaped on him by elements of the Liberal Party, he probably knows more about the workings of business than anyone else on that side of the house. He has always shown integrity, which has often been lacking in other members of the Liberal Party. So in my view, he is not all bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came into this house to talk about other problems. The Esperance High School is in a fast growing area and it clearly needs and is lacking government assistance. It is a school designed for 450 students. It now has almost 750 and it really has not had the money spent on it that it should have had to continually upgrade it. It was suggested by a colleague of mine that this was because it was considered to be a safe government seat and therefore the government was not interested in it. I do not think that is true. The problem is that it is simply a country seat which is a long way away. Most ministers react to pressure from their bureaucrats and because it is a long way away, they do not really care. It is not a safe seat; it is held by Ross Ainsworth of the National Party. It would be very simple for the Liberal Party to win that seat at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competition between the National Party and the Liberal Party in Western Australia is just as intense as it is between the Labor Party and the other parties. Ross Ainsworth, as the honourable member for Roe, ought to be assisting the people in his electorate because he could very easily lose that seat. He has been lulled into a sense of false confidence because he won it without preferences last year. In my view, there were special circumstances. I went out to support him&mdash;against the official Labor ticket, I might add&mdash;for local reasons. He cannot rely on that help in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The high school clearly needs upgrading. It requires $2 million to $3 million worth of upgrading now. Had the money been spent in the last few years, we may have been able to avoid some of that. It is true that there have been no real additions to the town of Esperance since the seat was lost by June Engrel following the redistribution. During the time of June Engrel and Mark Nevill, the upper house member, a lot of assistance went into the town of Esperance that simply has not been forthcoming in recent years. I do not believe it is because the government in Western Australia seems to think it is a safe seat. It is simply because it is a remote country seat and it has not been lobbied for strongly by its member. I sound a warning to that member now: if he does not start acting in the interests of the community, he simply will not survive the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was halfway through my speech in the chamber, before we moved the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1995-96 into the second chamber, I was making the point that the government had striven to create a dependence mentality and had, in fact, created a situation where we now have six million Australian people who are dependent upon some form of government transfer payment and we only have eight million people in the work force. I was giving the example of what had transpired with regard to the dependent spouse rebate and how, at one stage, where we had the situation where a spouse&mdash;be it a he or a she&mdash;had a dependent spouse, the breadwinner received some of his or her own money back through the taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had a debate as to whether or not that money should be paid to the breadwinner or whether it should be paid to the dependent person&mdash;a perfectly legitimate debate with many ways of solving the problem. However, the way the government dealt with the problem simply meant that the rebate is no longer paid, that the tax is kept and that a payment is made to the dependent spouse via the social welfare system. In other words, that dependent spouse is no longer dependent on the breadwinner but is now dependent on the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that there was a desire of the government to create a dependency mentality simply because it made people easier to control. That, indeed, prompts the question of what sort of an Australian would put extra taxes on the family home, the family car, the nation's health and Australian jobs. The answer is the man who told us at the last election that he would never do it&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact that those imposts have had came home to me very readily when a very angry constituent came in to see me to tell me that, as an expectant mother with her baby due in September, she found that there was going to be no baby bonus or benefit for her. To the contrary, she and her family were simply to be saddled with additional costs that arose from the fact that she was having a child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all the hype and self-congratulations on the government's baby bonus, it should be noted that the benefit has had its own gestation period. That is, it is nine months before it becomes payable. So my mum in Mackellar had to deal with the additional costs of the extension to the home to accommodate the new child, and, of course, they were planning to have a new car too to accommodate their enlarged family. The new taxes have no gestation period. They will have to be paid straight away&mdash;the new 12 per cent tax payable on building materials to build the new bedroom for the new child and the additional tax payable on the new motor vehicle. And she misses out on the one sweetener that was supposed to be there&mdash;the baby bonus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look also at other parts of the budget we see that overall, once again, the Labor Party is favouring centralist government over the states in a fair share of the finances that are raised. Labor's offerings to the states show that the Prime Minister's so-called commitment to federalism following the recent COAG meeting has been short-lived. As a percentage of total outlays, grants to the states and territories have not been substantially increased, but we should not be surprised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Total payments to the states and territories, as a percentage of total outlays, have progressively fallen from 33.1 per cent in 1983-84 to 25.6 per cent in this budget for 1995-96. Over the same period, Commonwealth own purpose outlays, as a share of total budget, have risen from 66.8 per cent to 74.2 per cent. Since 1983-84, total payments to the states have increased in normal terms by a factor of 1.7, while Commonwealth outlays have risen almost 2 1/2 times, from $38.2 billion in 1983-84 to a budgeted $91.7 billion in the coming financial year. It seems that thrift is a virtue to be practised by the states and ordinary households but never by the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of privatisation, we have seen the pea and thimble trick. As I have said in the context of the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill, the use of privatisation proceeds to achieve the government's pretended surplus is the greatest fraud of the budget. The Prime Minister should learn that privatisation is about competition, efficiency and ownership in the hands of mums and dads, not about making budget deficit forecasts look barely respectable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only the forecast of privatisation proceeds which interests the government and which cooks the budget deficit targets. The fact that the government consistently fails to meet its target appears irrelevant to its members. The Prime Minister does not actually want to sell anything; he just wants to use the forecast proceeds as a prop to the deficit. This means he cannot actually afford to sell off Qantas or the Commonwealth Bank in the coming year because he might need them, he thinks, in a future budget. That will be forestalled because there will not be one for this government. The Prime Minister should also understand that privatisation proceeds do not equate with expenditure restraint. To suggest it is fiscally responsible to use such revenue for recurrent expenditure is a swindle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The integrity of the budget was compromised at the point at which proceeds were earmarked for recurrent expenditure. I have always maintained that privatisation proceeds should be used to retire debt to relieve the onerous burden imposed upon us all. There is one thing that we can be sure of in this budget, and that is that the government's asset sales forecasts are bound to be wrong. This government is asking us to believe that it can increase its asset sales from the $55 million of last year when it forecast it would sell $2.4 billion. This year it has budgeted for $5.3 billion. Why should we believe it this year, any more than we could believe it any other year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past few years there have been shortfalls in the realisation of budget forecasts every year, from 1988-89 when it was $172 million down to last year when I said that $2.4 billion was forecast. There is a combined shortfall over that period of some $5 billion. So there is no reason to believe that this year it should be any different. The bottom line is that this budget does nothing to stem the fundamental problem. The Commonwealth government's current outlays are continually above recurrent revenue, which means it has been dis-saving, calling on domestic and foreign savings to pay for recruitment expenditure. The asset sales program has been used to try to camouflage the government's failure to address this fundamental problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians are appalled that their taxes have risen dramatically but the rate of spending by this federal government has increased even more rapidly. The result is that national savings have fallen to an all-time low, whether expressed on a per head basis or as a percentage of GDP. This budget fails the national interest test. This very day, Australian's foreign debt has risen another $3.7 billion. We will hear some excuse and we will see it written but perhaps we should just be grateful&mdash;it could have been worse. What sort of mentality is it that does not attack the reality?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So my final words to the Prime Minister are these: if the  Prime Minister really cares about this country at all and it is not just a stopover on the way to Paris, he should take his millions and his antiques, multiply them by 10 if he must but resign, so that once again this country and its people can enjoy the high standard of living to which they are entitled. I say what I said when I began this speech in the course of last week: it is the people who should be rich and the government which should be poor. The Prime Minister laughed when I said that, if the Prime Minister cares for this country at all, he should resign so that we can get on with bringing prosperity back to the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the very short time which is available to me, I will comment on the 1995 budget. The budget is an indication that this government is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. Since 1983, personal taxation has risen by a whopping 136 per cent; company tax has risen by a massive 370 per cent; indirect tax has risen by 149 per cent; and sales tax, the government's GST, has risen by 305 per cent. The total tax revenue is due to rise by 189.8 per cent, which is a very clear indication of what this government is on about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 10 May, the day after the budget was released, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But make no mistake, this is a taxing Budget. The new tax measures will add $6 billion to the Government coffers over the next two years. The increase in the company tax rate from 33 per cent to 36 per cent highlights Labor's ad hoc approach to repairing the revenue base and breaking election commitments.</PARA>
<PARA>Six billion dollars! The editorial gives an indication of the low regard in which this budget is held and it indicates to me and to the community to what lengths the government will go to achieve election success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the contents of the budget, I find it quite remarkable how many untimely messages the budget communicates to the community. At a time when the housing industry is beginning to recover, the government has decided to make home building, improvements and renovations cost more, and, in addition, the family car will cost more; every product that you buy will cost you more because of the flow-on effects of the 1993 budget. In the 1993 budget, there is a forward estimate of a one per cent increase on 1 July 1994 and of another increase on 1 July 1995. Every product will have additional sales tax added to it. Company tax will increase, we will pay more for the Medicare levy and contractors will have to pay more because they will be taken into the pay-as-you-earn situation. The bottom line, of course, is that the l-a-w tax cuts are not provided to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major issues to come out of the budget for the Labor Party and for this government is the decision to sell the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the icon of the Australian Labor Party. If the history of the Commonwealth Bank is traced, it is apparent that there are many commitments from the Labor Party that the bank would not be sold. There have been comments such as `John Curtin and Ben Chifley would turn in their graves if they knew that the government is selling the Commonwealth Bank'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To trace history back a little bit further so as to look at what has happened with a state Labor government in power in Victoria, that government said that the State Bank of Victoria&mdash;another icon&mdash;would never be sold. However, the bank was sold. The state government gave in to the pressure put on it by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Commonwealth took over the State Bank of Victoria at a bargain basement price, and now, of course, the Commonwealth will sell it off. In the interim period, staff numbers have been reduced from 55,000 to 35,000, which means that a total of 20,000 people have lost their jobs within the Commonwealth Bank! A big percentage of those people are ex-State Bank of Victoria employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian government was forced into allowing the Commonwealth to have the State Bank of Victoria, a situation which is, in the main, as a result of the incompetence and appalling financial management of the Cain-Kirner years. Since then, at election time, members of the Labor Party have repeatedly said that the Labor Party would never sell the Commonwealth Bank of Australia&mdash;the people's bank&mdash;and yet it is now selling it off! Obviously, in the lead-up to an election, the promises of members of the Labor Party cannot be believed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They did not tell caucus. They did not tell ALP members. They did not tell cabinet. Even the shareholders were ignored. Those shareholders had put their money up in good faith. The Treasurer of this country had told them that the Commonwealth Bank would not be sold, that it would be there for all time, and that the government would maintain its interest in it. A lot of people saw that as a safe, secure, and sound investment. Those people invested their hard-earned savings to prepare for their retirement. The members of the Labor Party have now decided to sell the bank without even consulting those shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank wrote to the shareholders. He said that the legislation had to be amended and, if the act for the Commonwealth Bank was amended, that it did not require the shareholders' approval. That is the sort of treatment that the ordinary shareholder has been given in this very sordid and tawdry deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue that comes from the sale of the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;and it is one that has not been considered to any great extent&mdash;is the future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank, which is a separate entity within the Commonwealth Bank. Over the years that bank has been a lender of last resort. Most of the money from the development bank has been made available to primary industry&mdash;small farms and small businesses in rural communities&mdash;as a lender of last resort in situations where perhaps the farming enterprise or the rural business need a bit of a helping hand to be viable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Development Bank primarily had regard for the prospects of success rather than for security. It also had an advice bureau which provided advice and assistance to promote small business efficiency. That bank had its own separate banking licence and operated as an individual entity. The future of the Commonwealth Development Bank is now uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That bank was in receipt of a $20 million taxable subsidy from the Commonwealth of Australia. That subsidy enabled the Commonwealth Development Bank to provide concessional loans to farming enterprises and rural businesses to ensure that they would be able to survive, particularly in times like those we have just come through, where we have had one of the worst droughts in Victoria's history. A lot of farmers have not only had no drought relief from the government, but now it appears that their avenue of finance will be taken away from them as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made no statement about this situation at all. What it has said is that it will sell the Commonwealth Bank. There has been no indication at all of whether the development bank will still be able to make additional finance available to rural industry and small business. The Commonwealth Development Bank, operating Australia-wide&mdash;and particularly in Victoria where it operates in conjunction with Rural Finance Victoria&mdash;has been very important in providing finance to farmers to develop their industry and their farms. We do not know what the future of that bank is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the government has not considered the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank. There is certainly nothing in the budget statement about the future of this bank. I am greatly concerned, not only about the access to finance but also about the employees of the development bank. It is quite obvious that if the Commonwealth Bank is sold the subsidy will not be available. What will happen to the employees? Will there be further reductions? As I indicated to you earlier, the bank has already reduced its staff from 55,000 to 35,000, and a lot of those people are former employees of the State Bank of Victoria. Are the employees of the Commonwealth Development Bank also at risk?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, my time has run out, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think it is appalling that the government has made so little time available for members to comment on this very important bill when it is before the parliament during this session. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to follow the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and support his well chosen comments. I represent an electorate which is in the bottom 10 per cent of Australia by income. It gives me no pleasure to say that, but it is typical of a changing Australia which has forgotten where its real strength lies. My electorate is also one which has a higher percentage than the national average of people who are either self-employed or involved in a small business. So we have a high percentage of self-employed people and those people in small business, and we have some of the least well-off people in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fudge-it budget, as it has become known, simply ignores regional Australia. It has become a habit for this government, and in an urban dominant society it is not hard to understand why that has occurred. But the reality is that 80 per cent of our export wealth is generated in regional Australia. When we look at the budget figures, we see that $17 million is allocated to support regional development in regional Australia; yet $245 million is given to cities, to the urban centres of Australia. It is $17 million for regional development and $19 million for regional strategic infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the program of $160 million over four years, that much quoted figure, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) was able to stretch it so far as to quadruple it the other day at a meeting at Port Augusta when he said it was $160 million per year over four years. I do not think the Treasurer (Mr Willis) knew about that and I guess the Treasurer ignored him anyway. But, given that the actual amount is $200,000 or $300,000 per electorate and that the extra taxation taken is millions of dollars per month out of each electorate, particularly regional electorates, we get a perspective of the imbalance that this government insists on inflicting not only on regional Australia but throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what does the government offer us? It offers more punishment for those people who are employed, by taxing them more on their houses and on their cars, et cetera, and it offers more paperwork and more tax for small business. What does it offer those areas in regional Australia which have higher than the national average of unemployment? People would be familiar with the upper Spencer Gulf regions, Whyalla, Port Augusta and Port Pirie, and Port Lincoln at the bottom of the Eyre Peninsula, the bottom of Spencer Gulf. Those cities combined have high numbers of people on Department of Social Security benefit. So we have very little money spent, much more money spent in the cities, more tax on regional Australia and just that constant grind of the dole queue for those people living particularly in those regional cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather ironic that today we had the One Nation train going into Adelaide, with joy abounding, no doubt, with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at the controls and in control of all the levers, selling the benefits of his wonderful Labor team. That train will go on to Port Augusta minus the Prime Minister and will be in Port August at 4.30 this afternoon. At the same time the head of National Rail will be asked why there are going to be job losses in the hundreds in Port Augusta over the next few months as a result of the rationalisation of rail throughout Australia. Not only do we have job losses but we have this constant theme of a misunderstanding that people are looking for stable jobs, not just to rely on the welfare state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been claiming for some time that it had these long-term unemployment queues cured. It was pleasing although saddening to at least get the admission last week that those people were being recycled. Up to 50 per cent of those people were coming straight back out of their long-term unemployment category on to short-term unemployment. I have been searching for those figures for many months and at last we have the admission that those unemployment numbers are nowhere near as attractive as the government would have us believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will talk briefly about the Commonwealth Bank. I have some emotional attachment to this topic because my first job was as a bank clerk in the humble old Bank of Adelaide, which had its demise some time ago. Having worked in that bank as a bank clerk at 15 years of age, I have always been a believer in a mixed economy. I had a strong belief that there was a strong role for private enterprise and for government. Oh, how that has suffered! Along with most South Australians, I suffered the indignity of seeing our State Bank absolutely wrecked. I accept that was not the direct responsibility of this government; the former Labor state government has to accept significant responsibility for that demise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this whole new deregulated financial system, I have seen many of the cornerstones of my beliefs in this society smashed to smithereens. So it is with the Commonwealth Bank. I guess, like billions of Australians, I had my little money box and, from time to time, in went those few pennies. The frugal amount accumulated into modest savings in that little blue book at the post office. Yet, that is sacrificed in the name of balancing the budget. The honourable member for Bendigo has spoken about the fact that the Labor caucus was not even consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at that $4 billion; let us think about what the former Senator Peter Walsh recently said about asset sales. He regarded it as fraudulent to sell these assets to other people who simply use their savings to buy those assets from the government. All that has been done is to shift an asset from a government balance sheet to somebody else's balance sheet. It has done nothing to make the total amount of savings available throughout our country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely, as the honourable member says. There is considerable understanding of the accounting system and we know exactly what this national government is doing. So, we have the $4 billion there and we have the $4 billion l-a-w tax cuts that were not granted. Allegedly, three years down the track the money will be put into superannuation, or whatever. It really is quite a remarkable act of absolute effrontery to suggest that the government can have l-a-w tax cuts, sell the Commonwealth Bank and then claim that somehow or other, in that jumble, the money is going to be put into national savings three years down the track. It could just as easily be argued that we are going to have tax increases in three years time to pay for that $4 billion that we did not get this time or to pay for the $4 billion from the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. It is absolute folly to talk in these terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with a few comments about regional people and regional economy. I think it is too easy for us as a national parliament to give up on full employment. It is too easy for us to ignore regional Australia. I think most people concede this now. It is not just the political imperative of winning those half a dozen seats in central New South Wales. Regional Australia has been more severely damaged and suffers more severe disadvantage than urban Australia because of the policies of centralism and because of the indirect tax system. I think there is enough evidence&mdash;whether it is from EPAC, from Professor Gregory or whatever&mdash;to establish that many of the people living in regional Australia are amongst our poorest and most disadvantaged even though they provide 80 per cent of our exports. </PARA>

We will get back to full employment levels&mdash;that is, something like three per cent. This has been ignored and neglected by this government. This has got to be our aim. It is an aim that this government has given up and that is the great tragedy of this fudge-it budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to draw attention to the speaking list that we have today for this Appropriation Bill (No. 1). There are 26 opposition members but no government members. It goes to show that members of the government are too ashamed to come in here and try to defend the budget. It is indefensible. Also, our time to do this has been cut quite considerably. In the meantime, government members are not here, and they talk about lack of policies. I want to talk about the lack of truth and the political process around the 1993 elections. We were promised tax cuts. We were promised that there would be a permanent reduction in the sales tax on motor vehicles; that the Commonwealth Bank would not be sold and that the government would not have a lesser amount of equity in it than what it had at that stage; that the company rate of tax would be reduced; and, of course, that the Medicare levy would stay as it was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at all of those promises in the light of what we are seeing today. The tax cuts have been forsaken and the company tax rate has increased, to the disadvantage of Australian companies trading against the Asian nations and against the New Zealand nation. We have been put at a severe disadvantage. The Commonwealth Bank&mdash;lo and behold!&mdash;is now for sale, unbeknown to the caucus and known only to the Treasurer (Mr Willis). What you see in the whole thing is a massive corruption of the political system. It is no wonder that people out there are wondering whether they can ever trust politicians again. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is a specialist in this corruption. People must be asking: who would trust him?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the opposition are accused of not having policies. I go on record as saying that never was a more comprehensive lot of policies placed before the people of Australia than at the last election. However, these have been corrupted for the sake of dishonesty and political advertising. I think Australia has lost a great opportunity. It has been hoodwinked. If I were going to the next election&mdash;I will not be&mdash;I would be saying that the only policy we want is to get rid of Keating and this corrupt government so that we can get on with the job of defending the Australian nation, defending the Australian character. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the distortion that has come out of this budget as far as the deficit is concerned. I will start with the real deficit and how the government has fudged the issues to bring in what it has called an `implied surplus'. We start with a deficit of $8.23 billion. This is reduced by asset sales of $5.35 billion&mdash;selling off the public assets to reduce the deficit&mdash;$2.222 billion for repayment of the state debt, to which agreement my own state of Queensland was a willing partner, and the ABS adjustment of $1.378 billion. So we get the implied surplus of $718 million. What a hoodwink! It is no wonder that the people of Australia do not believe in politicians and parliaments. I believe that this has discredited us even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget, in its implication, was actually a spending spree, especially when we take into account the fact that the budget papers show an increase in taxation of 13.4 per cent. Yes, the Medicare levy went up; yes, the company tax rates went up; yes, the sales tax on motor vehicles went up; and, yes, a whole stack of other things went up. There has been a 13.4 per cent increase in total indirect and direct taxation and a spending spree which sees the government spending 5.3 per cent more than it did last year. Anybody who talks about restraint ought to have a look at those figures. Of course, this has all been done at the expense of selling off the family silver and the Australian assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pay particular attention to what has happened with the public debt interest bill. It has increased by some 23 per cent, from $8,134 million last year to $10,077 million this year. The payment of interest on the public debt accounts for 8.9 per cent of all the spending. If Australians appreciated how this country has been put into hock, they would quite determinedly shift this government next time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Small business will never have it so good again,' is one statement which has been made. We must consider small businesses and how they took that statement. I know the manner in which it has been taken in my electorate. I know the constraints under which small businesses have been operating in the last six months. I would say they have had some of the leanest years ever, and I think we will have to take those words as a threat, because perhaps the Prime Minister meant that it is not as good as people would want it to be but it is as good as it will get under Paul Keating as the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own city, shops are closing and people for the first time are borrowing just to carry on. The impact of the fringe benefits tax is massive. The impact of that tax and the superannuation guarantee charge has meant that in my area there are now fewer people working in small business than before. There is just no encouragement. I was speaking to a farmer the other day who can grow 11,000 to 12,000 tonnes of cane and manage it himself. Provided he gets contract harvesting and planting done, he can look after 11,000 tonnes of cane. That is where the employment has gone; it is because of the impact of the fringe benefits tax and the superannuation guarantee charge now facing small business at four to five per cent, rising to nine per cent. As for the sales tax increases, the Prime Minister at the last election painted the GST as being a 15 per cent increase on everything. What is happening? We are getting those increases bit by bit through sales tax. That is the worst form of indirect taxation that business can suffer. No wonder they are going under at such a rapid rate of knots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The foreign debt figure that I have, and it has probably increased since then, is $162 billion, yet the Prime Minister tries to explain that there are overseas deposits in reserve. Surely, when you talk about a net debt, that is net after the overseas reserves have been taken into consideration. This has risen from the 1983 figure of $23 billion to $162 billion now. When the Prime Minister talks about the overseas reserves, it is not only selling off the public assets such as Qantas and the bank to shore up his expenditure, but we are also seeing companies sold to overseas interests, including Arnotts biscuits; that parrot was as Australian as you could get. I understand that Nanna pies are now going overseas. The Australian meat pie is now going to be produced overseas and probably imported back into Australia so that we can have the typical Australian meat pie. Speedo, Edgell, ARC and all of those companies are the ones that are supplying the overseas reserves and the deposits because we are selling off not only the public assets but the private assets as well. I think this is something that should be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could I talk about housing? I know that throughout my electorate, and in other electorates in Queensland, there is a massive halt in the housing industry at the moment. Since Christmas there are people who have just put off their employees and are sitting down to wait. Why? Because they and the people who are buying houses have felt in the past the impact of high interest rates of this government and of the Prime Minister, and there is a great uncertainty about interest rates. There will continue to be an uncertainty about interest rates no matter how hard the Prime Minister tries to push them down, because the budget itself is not a real budget. It has implications of borrowing, it has implications that targets will not be met, and we will be in a worse situation, probably facing higher taxes in 12 months time than we are at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade deficit, estimated to come in at $27 billion, will have a massive impact not only on the foreign debt but on interest rates. Once the foreign exchange rate starts dropping a bit, there will be a decision made&mdash;probably not this side of an election but certainly the other side of the election&mdash;to push up interest rates to manage that. We have in addition a Prime Minister that no-one trusted in connection with interest rates when he was Treasurer, nor now as Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales tax additions, as I said before, are a de facto GST. This is just an outright grab for more taxes to cover the hole that could have been covered with a GST. I went looking for some details on the sales tax increases and I found no information available. They may be available by the end of June. The housing industry is going to have problems again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention the drought in my area. We talk about the battlers of Australia. Primary industry people, particularly those in the bush who have suffered five years of drought, are not only battlers, they are also forgotten people. They have been forgotten by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural adjustment scheme is a scandal. It does not apply itself to redressing the problems in the bush. The effects of this drought on the underground water supplies are being felt right along the Queensland coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget is a sham. The government is ashamed to bring its own members in here to speak to it. I believe the people of Australia ought to bear this in mind when they come to the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to follow my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). I agree with a great deal of what he has said, particularly in regard to the small business sector. It is in that area that I would like to concentrate my comments this afternoon. Last week in my electorate the annual Logan City Chamber of Commerce small business awards were presented at a function which was attended by more than 500 local businessmen and women. It was a sell-out, as it usually is. It is one of the highlights of the Logan City business year. It pays tribute to and recognises the great contribution of local businesses to the economy of the city, to employment for the local community and, indeed, to the contribution that these organisations make to the nation. Export achievements are high on the recognition agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The awards night is always attended by local political and community leaders, as it should be. After all, Logan City is Queensland's second or third biggest city. With more than 6,000 businesses registered there, it has one of the highest concentrations of small businesses in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the awards, the president of the chamber, Mr Kenneth Wong, gave his annual address, prefixing it with a statement that the chamber was non-political and did not play partisan politics. Mr Wong then launched into a tirade against the 1995-96 federal budget, especially the statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) regarding the state of the economy and his gratuitous advice to small businessmen about going out and getting a job. Mr Wong expressed the frustration of his local small business community with the never-ending actions of the federal government penalising small business. His comments were met with resounding applause, much to the horror of the ALP state and federal parliamentarians presents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the government seems genuinely surprised that the 1995-96 budget has gone over like a lead balloon in the electorate. That surprise demonstrates just how out of touch the Prime Minister and his ministers are with mainstream Australia. In my electorate, which is very representative of mainstream Australia, this is a bad news budget. It is especially bad news for small business. Small business is increasingly the backbone of the Australian economy and of the economy of electorates such as mine. There is nothing in this budget for small business, that is, nothing positive or constructive. There is plenty in the budget which penalises small business and will make it even tougher for the small business sector to survive, let alone expand and create jobs for young Australians. Small business has rightly reacted with anger to the budget tax hikes which directly impact on small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the Prime Minister's reaction to the concern and anger expressed by small business? With breathtaking arrogance he said, `This is as good as it's going to get for small business.' That statement will rank alongside the comment of the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, when he said, `Silly old b' to a pensioner in Adelaide some years ago, both in terms of arrogance and insensitivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the budget and a whole range of federal, state and local taxes and charges imposed on business, particularly on small business, it is little wonder that small business is doing it very tough. Yet the Prime Minister's only response is to say that things will not get any better and that small business ought to be grateful for what it got. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst affected area of small business as a result of the budget is the building industry. It has been one of the great bastions of small business and individual entrepreneurs in Australia for generations. Already hard hit by the impact of high interest rates, the building and housing industries have been dealt a cruel and, for many, a fatal blow in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time, the budget introduces a sales tax on building materials, including materials used in home building. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) described the 12 per cent new tax as being `a concessional rate'. I can assure him that neither the building industry nor home buyers and people constructing buildings regard a 12 per cent tax as a concessional rate. This tax is a cruel and heartless body blow for the building and housing sectors, coming at a time when there is already a major downturn in housing construction and building activity, as the figures that were released last week confirm. By forcing up interest rates through bad fiscal and economic management, the government is proving that it could not care less about small business and about the housing and building sectors in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget is even further proof of the willingness of this government to sacrifice small business so that it does not have to make the decisions that are tough on government rather than tough on business. Every small businessman or businesswoman needs one or more motor vehicles to conduct their business. Again, in this area, small business has been hardest hit of all, with the increase in the sales tax on motor vehicles&mdash;something that will cost the average car buyer about $1,000 per vehicle. We all would know in our electorates how flat the sales of new cars have been since about the end of January. This hike also hits motor dealers, many of whom are small businessmen operating in the suburbs, provincial towns and small towns. The downturn in housing and building will flow on to motor vehicle sales, if it does not do so already, because of the higher interest rates and the general slowing down in economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government dealt yet another blow to small business with the three per cent income tax hike for company taxpayers. For a whole variety of legitimate reasons, many small businesses are structured as companies and pay company tax. For those still making a profit, this government has put its hand back into their pockets, and yet another 1993 federal election promise has been shamelessly broken. The small businessman paying tax on a PAYE basis will lose out, as well, with the second stage of the l-a-w tax cuts being abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that small business and even big business have reacted most negatively to the budget? Is it any wonder that mainstream Australia has given the budget the thumbs down, as well? The electorate has basically turned off the Prime Minister and the government, simply because they cannot be believed any longer. The electorate does not trust the government: it believes the government's promises are not worth a pinch of salt. Small business&mdash;which, as I said, is the backbone of the private sector&mdash;is turned off, first of all; and, increasingly, the whole electorate is doing so because of broken promises and bad government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My particular electorate runs from the outskirts of Brisbane to the top of the Gold Coast. It encompasses the fastest growing part not only of Queensland but, indeed, of the whole nation. Small business is at the heart and soul of any electorate, serving population growth. I do not have dozens of large factories, but I do have hundreds and hundreds of small to medium-sized businesses, and many of them are doing it very tough indeed. Tragically, as a result of this budget, they will be joined by more, especially by those drawn from the building services, housing construction and retailing areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As long as the VIP jet is on stand-by, and as long as the French clocks and antiques are still selling well, the Prime Minister seems to be happy. I do not think that in this particular budget we have very much to be proud of at all. In actual fact, as the honourable member for Dawson mentioned, if it were not for asset sales, this budget would be an absolute disaster. It is indeed a smoke and mirrors trick. It is one that has been recognised by the Australian people as a fraud, and I basically believe that this government should be condemned by every Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and to also make the point, which some other members have made, that government members are not in here debating the budget. They are obviously not prepared today to defend the budget which the government has brought forward for the Australian people. That is an indication of the government's actual lack of confidence. Of course, that situation is underscored by the very fact that two or three of the main items were brought into the budget on the Sunday or Monday night prior to the budget, and government members did not even know anything about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members had no idea whatsoever, particularly in regard to the selling off of the Commonwealth Bank. The only reason that the government actually brought in the sale of the Commonwealth Bank was to try to get a positive effect out there. There was no other reason: there was no real logic to it, and no real consideration of what was good for Australia, or anything like that. It was just a matter of having a glossy effect. That decision underlies the way in which this budget has been put together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some comparisons between when this government came into power and what it is like now. It is interesting that since 1983, over a period of about 12 years, the average weekly earnings of Australians have gone up by 90 per cent. But if you then have a look at the sort of management which this country has been under in regard to taxation, you will find this figure: individual taxation has increased by 136.8 per cent. So wages go up 90 per cent;  individual taxation by 136.8 per cent. Is that what is helpful to the battler in Australia? Is that what is helpful to regional Australia? Is that what is helpful to working mums and dads who are trying to feed and clothe and provide educational facilities for their children? It certainly is not. Yet this government claims that this is a good budget. But we know that they are fudging figures, they are doing U-turns on promises, and least of all are they helping the ordinary, average Australian out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you have a look at the company tax increase, the take is 370 per cent. Indirect tax is up 149.8 per cent. And listen to this one, the one that nobody really knows about, does not want to be involved with and that the government really canned in regard to the GST: sales tax in Australia is up 305.7 per cent. So this government is all the time spending big and the people who really pay for it and who are getting it in the back of the neck are the hard working, average income families in Australia. In 1983, average weekly earnings were $338 and last year the average was up to $642. As I said, average weekly earnings have gone up only by 90 per cent, but all of those taxation measures have gone up by more than 136 per cent in the same period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you have a look at, say, the state governments and how they are controlling their budgets, what you find is that in the last few years state budgets have been cut back and the states have cut their expenditure while the federal government is increasing its expenditure&mdash;and it is not just increasing, but increasing in real terms. Yet average Australians have gone through a time of belt tightening. And what do we find the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) doing in this budget? He says, `We can expand the Commonwealth's belt and we can off-load our expenditure onto ordinary Australians. They are the ones who can cop it. They can wear it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is high time that this government was held to account and I say to the honourable member opposite, including the member for Calare (Mr Simmons), and the government that they ought to go to the people. Let the people have a say about this. The people are not happy with effectively having a new tax of 12 per cent on the family home. They are not happy with that, particularly after the government so heavily criticised, up hill and down dale, a goods and services tax. This really is a goods and services tax, for want of a better name; it is just that it is only on building supplies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then they want to increase the motor vehicle sales tax. We had a promise: to bring it down to 15 per cent. Of course, we all know there is a one per cent increase coming in about three weeks time, in July, quite apart from the five per cent. Yet this government promised tax cuts. Now they have done what is really a mirrors trick in regard to superannuation and tax cuts, holding out the benefit to Australian people by saying, `If you re-elect us, then the superannuation scheme and benefits which we are going to contribute to you in 1997-98, and which you will receive in the year 2025, are going to be of tremendous benefit. So save up for the nation. We are going to take it out of your pocket and we are going to give it back to you in 2025.' I say to the Australian people that in 1993 the Prime Minister promised tax cuts and by 1995 they were gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the government really expect the Australian people out there to believe that the Prime Minister can make a promise in 1995 about what is going to happen in regard to superannuation in 1998 and that that is going to be delivered in the year 2025? Of course not. Why should they? He has done a U-turn in regard to tax cuts and, as far as my electorate is concerned, he has done a U-turn in regard to the forest industries. We had an absolute debacle in that area in regard to the honesty of the Prime Minister and this government. They talk about having things done in a systematic, rational way in this country and say that everything is being scientifically decided in regard to the forest industries. So many small business people in Tasmania in my electorate are dependent on forest industries and the various businesses which grow up around those industries. Here we see small business in this budget being heavily attacked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forest industries are very important. I bring to the attention of people who are listening to this debate today that our overseas debt in the last quarter has gone up by $3.6 billion. That is over $200 per man, woman and child in the last three months. The government has the hide to tell us that the economy is going great, yet our debt overseas is going up! At the same time, in regard to the forest industries, one of the industries where we ought to be exporting product, we are actually importing $1.7 billion to $2 billion worth of product. It is just creating overseas debt. Why? Because this government procrastinates in regard to the second largest manufacturing business in Australia, the forest industries. It procrastinates; it changes. I think we have had five or six plans in the last seven years from this government. Now I understand they are looking at what they call a timber plan. Their backbenchers and other people are involved in discussing, not the forest industries strategy which they brought out in 1992, but some new timber plan for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the government why it does not stick to its word. No matter what it does&mdash;in the last two or three years, in particular&mdash;it cannot be trusted. This budget is a clear example of a government that cannot be trusted. I believe that, as time goes on, the Australian people are not going to trust this government no matter what the Prime Minister says, or what the ministers of this government say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter what one looks at. In education, down our way in Tasmania, we deserve to have an extra 2,000 places in our university and the government will not even give us 20. In regard to health insurance and Medicare in our area, it says there will be no increase in Medicare. What does it do? It puts Medicare up. And so it goes on. No matter what this government says, there is no reason for any Australian out there to believe it, particularly when it expands its belt, its budget, its spending and then expects everybody else to pull their belts in. I just hope that the Prime Minister will go to the election as soon as possible so that the Australian people can pass judgment on what I believe is a rotten budget. </PARA>

As a sergeant major, he seized power in 1980, and ruled from 1980 to 1988. In this period he sought to align Suriname with Libya, Cuba and Grenada. After the invasion of Grenada by the United States in 1983, Bouterse turned to civilian rule, although he maintained the constitutional right to intervene in political affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986 Bouterse allegedly deposited several million dollars in the notorious and now defunct BCCI Bank in Miami. A contract written in Dutch and signed by Hank Goedschalk, the then governor of the Suriname Central Bank and a close associate of Bouterse, called for the Camari Corporation, based in the Netherlands Antilles, to lend the Surinese government $US200 million in cash. In the same year, 1991, the Dutch foreign intelligence agency, the IDB and the Dutch intelligence agency, the BVD, began investigating drug trafficking, especially cocaine coming from Colombia to Suriname and going on to Holland and the United States. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the partners in the conspiracy claimed that Bouterse and Boerenveen intended to channel the profits into the country's economy and split the balance. Boerenveen was sentenced to 12 years in prison and released early in 1991. On his release, he was promoted by Bouterse from captain to commandant and appointed commander of the military police and central intelligence services of Suriname's armed forces. In 1990, the Netherlands, faced with a growing drug problem arising from drugs from Suriname, expelled two diplomats, who had ties to Bouterse, for drug related activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Desi Bouterse resigned as Suriname's army chief in November 1992. He established himself as an international businessman and went on to form the National Democratic Party, the NDP. Despite his formal departure from the military, Bouterse has maintained a well-armed private army and still has a significant number of sympathisers in the armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As head of the NDP, Bouterse has used his position to run a populist campaign against the unpopular economic austerity programs foisted on President Ronald Venetiaan by the IMF and the World Bank. His political rhetoric is characterised by a `narco-nationalist' style, mainly directed against the Dutch. Regrettably, Bouterse has indeed increased his power after the death, in December 1993, of Pablo Escobar Gaviria, who was the head of Colombia's notorious Medellin cartel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The political power base of Bouterse is not to be underestimated. His money, which is derived from the drug trade, keeps many followers loyal, especially in the local police force. The Medellin cartel was already in decline prior to Escobar's death. Its operations have diminished or collapsed into the business network of the Cali cartel. Escobar had been a regular visitor to Suriname from 1987 to 1989, and there were several meetings between Bouterse and Escobar. Bouterse continues to control the jungle infrastructure which facilitates the transhipment of narcotics. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the 1994 US Department of State <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on international strategy to combat narcotics trafficking</EMPHASIS>, Suriname is not itself a money laundering centre. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The non-convertibility of Suriname's currency and its limited financial market steer money launderers elsewhere.</PARA>

It was eventually granted 375,000 acres near the Guyana border, where Bouterse allegedly plays a major role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing these comments about Desi Bouterse, his associates and networks in mind, I turn now to the documents I am specifically dealing with today. In this context, the following questions arise. First, why is Mr Mark Leibler, a prominent Melbourne tax lawyer who at one stage served on three separate advisory committees to the Commissioner of Taxation and who was a major witness before the Public Accounts Committee inquiry into the Australian Taxation Office which took place from 1991 to 93, acting as an agent in a major financial transaction involving the Israeli intelligence service, the Mossad, and the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Michael Costello?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, what is the `distribution schedule' held by Mr Costello and referred to in the two copies of the letter, and who is on it? Third, was any of the $US640,000 paid to Mr Costello for his personal use, and if so, why? Fourth, was any of the $US640,000 paid to Mr Costello acting as an agent for the Labor Party for election or other purposes? Fifth, and alternatively, was any of this money paid to Mr Costello for services rendered to any foreign government or foreign intelligence service? Sixth, was any of the money derived from the proceeds of crime, most especially drug trafficking, as Suriname is well known as a drug source? Finally, is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade aware of the involvement of his permanent head in this transaction, and if not, why not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 10 August 1993 described Mr Costello as an `unusual diplomat'. He certainly is. He is allegedly the architect of the unfulfilled Cambodian peace plan, yet he has served only 3 1/2 years abroad as a diplomat. Costello has no experience in Cambodian affairs and has not lived in Asia. He speaks no Asian language. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 26 January 1990 cited a journalist as commenting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He [Costello] is Asia illiterate. And yet he is supposed to bring peace to Cambodia. I find it very odd.'</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed. The truth is that Mr Costello is a monument to mafia mateship. The government's reaction to the public disclosure of Costello's relationship with Valeriy Zemskov, an officer of the KGB's elite special reserve, with whom Costello shared many long lunches, dinners and animated conversations, was a typical case of mafia mateship. The government reached for the whitewash brush to paint over the truth of the Costello-Zemskov relationship, yet a cabinet in-confidence minute to the then foreign minister, Mr Hayden, of 11 March 1986, clearly showed that MI5 had warned ASIO of Zemskov's real status in January 1985. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Costello's unprecedented promotion to the position of secretary, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has leaked so much it is in danger of becoming incontinent. In the second half of 1994, we saw the leaking of the most sensitive Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade documents in relation to the Cambodia crisis. Costello himself has been suspected and interviewed, on previous occasions, by the Australian Federal Police in relation to the disclosure of official information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASIO and ASIS have undergone serious inquiries and reports of both inquiries are most disturbing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that I am seeking to table these documents in the national interest.

The Australian people have a right to know the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minimal response the government should make is to ensure that Mr Costello is immediately stood down as the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, pending non-partisan investigation into the serious issues I have raised today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's budget, which we are debating, is now at an interesting stage. We have the national account figures for the last quarter, we have had the April unemployment figures and, this Thursday, the May unemployment figure will be released. We have just had the OECD report on Australia, and the trade figures have just come in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in total, we now have quite a range of indicators in relation to the state of the economy and just how good the government's budget and its forecasts are, in relation to the budget surplus, interest rates, employment levels, the balance of payments and the value of the dollar, and in relation to just how sustainable our economic growth is and at what level that sustainability is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government tries to give the impression that this is a country that is doing well, and to confirm its projection it then makes some comfortable comparisons. It uses its previous record&mdash;which included the `recession that we had to have'&mdash;of past mismanagement of this government and what that has meant for this country. It uses selective comparisons with the OECD. It refers to the broad GDP growth, where one has to take into account that Australia is one of the few countries in the world that still has a significant migration program and therefore our growth rate has to be higher than that of most of our competitors if we are to be able to sustain real growth on a per capita basis. That partly explains the paradox that we consistently have higher unemployment figures than many other comparable countries, yet it is claimed that our growth rate is also higher. But the comparison is never made with the east Asian countries, the ones with which we have to compete, whether it be on growth rates, on employment levels or on savings and investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One little element that comes out of the budget is the increase in the company tax rate by nine per cent from 33 to 36 per cent. There have already been a number of statements from Asian business and government people that any chance Australia might have had of making itself a regional business centre as an alternative to an Asian country is now gone, both because of the higher company tax rate and because of the uncertainty as to what Australia's policies long term are&mdash;it is only a couple of years since it was stated that this would be the appropriate rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then people would say that that is an unfair comparison with our Asian neighbours because they are in an earlier phase of economic growth and therefore we should be looking at more mature economies, similar to ours. One can look at the other Anglo countries, perhaps, because it is generally considered that these are not at the forefront of economic development at the present time. One can look at the OECD and also quote comparisons and averages on interest rates, unemployment levels and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, however, one can look at New Zealand. New Zealand is even more an Anglo country than we are and New Zealand had its budget last Thursday. Any comparison with New Zealand should be very comfortable indeed, because with the exception of some gas New Zealand does not have the mineral wealth that Australia does; that is our major source of export income. It has a far narrower range of agricultural products than we do; it does not have any real grains industry or subtropical agriculture. Because of the small population it has no real economy of scale for its manufacturing industries. In fact, New Zealand, it has been stated, would be the first country to slide from being a developed country into being a developing country again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One may compare the New Zealand budget of last Thursday night with our budget. This affords a very fascinating comparison between a country that really is doing well and a country&mdash;Australia&mdash;that is sliding, to the detriment of its people and its economy generally. It has been stated in this budget that there will be a budget surplus, after allowing for asset sales, of $718 million. Elsewhere in the budget documents the deficit is classed as $8.2 billion, as a more real deficit. If we read elsewhere we find that the economics section of the New South Wales Farmers Federation, for example, would put the budget deficit at $12.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at New Zealand. Its budget surplus for 1995-96 will be $3.3 billion. There are no asset sales&mdash;no Qantas being put up for sale for the umpteenth time. The New Zealanders can quote very accurately, because of the procedures they now adopt in their country and their policies, that that budget surplus will increase significantly to $7.8 billion by 1997-98. They will be able to have some tax cuts as well; those, obviously, will be coming in the next few months, getting closer to their election. They will be able to be financed from the future surpluses, and those surpluses will still be there. If one compares that $3.3 billion budget surplus and Australia's $718 million surplus, at the best&mdash;or, at the worst, $12.5 billion deficit&mdash;then those figures become even more alarming from an Australian point of view in view of the size of the New Zealand economy relative to the Australian economy. It would probably be only about one-sixth or one-seventh of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, comparing the budgets in another way, in the Australian budget of 1983-84 nine per cent of total budget outlays were for capital expenditure. Total budget outlays for capital works in this coming year in Australia will be negative. They will move into a position of disinvestment. Yet New Zealand is still able to provide real investment capital and have a budget surplus in that country, for example, several hundred million dollars extra for roadworks plus extra money for research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at taxation levels, the highest personal income tax level in New Zealand is 33 per cent. Australia's tax level is about 15 per cent higher and New Zealand is talking about tax cuts in the next few months. In both countries growth rate forecasts for this coming financial year are less than the current year. New Zealand has had a growth rate of 5.3 per cent for the current year and it is claiming in its budget documents that it will come down to three per cent. Depending on whether or not we believe that the March quarter figure is the real figure for the next 12 months, we have already slipped to 3.75 per cent for the last quarter on an annualised basis. The projection in the budget was that we would be at 3.75 per cent for all of the next financial year, but the reality or the trend is that that last quarter increase is now so low that, if it continues, our real growth rate for the next 12 months in this country is going to be 2.25 per cent, not 3.75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That carries with it very severe implications for the level of the budget deficit because taxation income will be down, welfare payments will be up and unemployment must start to increase. To maintain the unemployment level at the current rate, Australia needs growth of at least 3 1/2 per cent in the economy. It means that when New Zealand looks ahead it is able to claim, I believe fairly consistently, that it will average a four per cent growth rate over the next few years. Australia is certainly not able to claim that. That is the difference in the growth rates between the two countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has already had an impact on unemployment levels. If we compare Australia with the OECD generally, we have averaged two per cent higher for the last calendar year, we are 1 1/2 per cent higher so far this year on projections and we are three to four per cent ahead of the United States. Even if the United States has a falling employment level at the present time, it has a lot of surplus ahead of us. New Zealand has about a two per cent lower level of unemployment or higher employment figures than we have. Many would say that countries such as the United States and New Zealand have far more genuine figures for employment levels than Australia because it is calculated that up to two per cent of our people in employment in Australia are on make-work schemes, training schemes and so forth, whereas New Zealand and the United States do not have anywhere near the same degree of those programs. Also, our definition of employment is a very unrealistic one because anyone who does any paid work at all is classed as being employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's real level of unemployment is about four per cent higher than that of New Zealand at the present time. In order to look at what that means, I would like to quote Max Walsh from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> last Friday. Referring to the OECD report, he made the point that our investment has been very low and that New Zealand, the United States and other countries have higher levels of investment than we do. Then in the last paragraph he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the OECD report did not say, but which is central to the whole issue of business investment is that if the lower level of increase in our net capital stock condemns us to a growth limit of `a little over three per cent', then unemployment by 2000 will not be reduced, as the Government claims, to a 5 per cent figure, but be permanently stuck at double that figure.</PARA>
<PARA>That is at about 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at interest rates, New Zealand is currently about two per cent less than Australia and that has been consistently the case for the last four years. The United States is even lower: it is about 2 1/2 per cent lower than Australia. We have to look at what that means regarding encouragement for investment. If we look at what the rest of the world thinks of us and our future compared with New Zealand, a few years ago the Australian dollar was worth 20c more than the New Zealand dollar, today it is worth 7c more than the New Zealand dollar and the New Zealanders are confident that, within the next few years, we will be trading at par, something that has never happened in the relative growth rates, outlooks or prospects for our two countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not necessarily help our exports. What it does mean is that it condemns us to a declining standard of living relative to other countries. As we buy more and more of our inputs from overseas&mdash;and we are doing that and it is one of the problems we have with our balance of trade figures&mdash;it means that they become more and more expensive. I believe in the long term&mdash;and you may feel that is a surprising thing for a National Party person to say&mdash;that a weak dollar indicates a declining standard of living, not an ability to help exports. If I had more time, I could go into the detail of what this means&mdash;for example, with imported inputs that are necessary for some of our agricultural and other exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the Australian dollar and its volatility we should also look at our trade balance. New Zealand's current account deficit is about 2.2 per cent of its GDP and improving; ours is almost down to our worst figure, about six per cent of GDP. That is a $27 billion current account deficit for the 12 months. One of the little ironies is that, because of the wool stockpile and because we are able to sell from the stockpile partly due to the drought and the reduced wool production, the increased wool exports so far this calendar year have increased by half our merchandise trade for this year. It is one of those ironic things: what was a negative is now a real positive for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it does raise the question of a run on the dollar. It raises the question of high interest rates and, in comparing the two countries, it comes back to how much further ahead New Zealand is with its fiscal responsibility act. It means it has far greater transparency, accuracy and accountability in the presentation of its figures. It means that its reserve bank act, which must concentrate on lower levels of inflation, is having its impact. If one argues that New Zealand has been hard on welfare for some of its people, there is nothing worse in welfare than people without a job.

As my colleague the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who spoke before me, said, the figures released by the government in relation to unemployment are not genuine. The only people who are, in fact, recorded as being unemployed are those receiving jobstart, newstart or youth training allowances, and those people who work even some small number of hours per week are not deemed to be in the system. Indeed, if a person is not in receipt of social security, that person is deemed to be employed. Of course, people who are in training programs are also deemed to be employed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by expressing dismay at the processes of the debate surrounding this budget. It is a classical demonstration of the contempt with which the Labor government now holds the parliament that this budget debate has been moved off to the Main Committee, that speakers are restricted in their time and that, when the consideration in detail comes on later today, the amount of time available for debate will be almost nil. The speakers list for today's debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) shows 26 members from the opposition but not a single government member. That says something about where the budget stands: 26 opposition members have plenty of things to say but not one government member is here prepared to defend the budget. There is no economic minister present to listen to the words of the elected representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the presence of the chairman of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore)&mdash;no doubt the environment is an important element of this budget. However, I hope that his voice can be heard loud and clear in portraying back to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) the anger in the speeches that are being made and the condemnation of so many aspects of this budget. The Treasurer himself should be here to listen: he should be participating in this debate; and I think it is appalling that he is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look to the consideration of the bill in detail tonight, 10 minutes are allowed for the consideration in detail of groups of three or four departments at a time. What a mockery of the words `consideration in detail'&mdash;10 minutes for three departments! In fact, my own area of interest, consumer affairs, is not listed at all and presumably has got to be dealt with under the estimates for Attorney-General's, along with two or three other portfolios&mdash;a total of 10 minutes allocated. That is not consideration in detail. That is contempt for the parliamentary process; that is contempt for democracy. That is the very sound reason why this government will be thrown out of office at the very first available opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, as a result of this budget, consumers will pay more for almost every single thing that they buy. There will be increased taxes on a whole range of merchandise and goods. There will be the obvious increases in tax on motor vehicles and building materials and tobacco, which will be passed directly onto consumers, but the higher taxes applying to business will also be reflected in higher prices charged for goods and services as business naturally seeks to recover the extra cost of these tax slugs. The higher Medicare levy is just another tax increase. Labor's election promised tax cuts have become record tax increases. The five per cent sales tax on the family car, which will increase to six per cent on 1 July, will alone add 0.3 per cent to the consumer price index. Ironically, the budget will not affect luxury cars except, of course, for the one per cent increase that has been put in place from a previous budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general sales taxes that were foreshadowed in earlier budgets, but which take effect on 1 July 1995, will certainly have an effect on the price of every item in every store. In fact, one of the big increases in budget revenue for the government is in this area of sales tax receipts, which will go up from $11.6 billion to $14.2 billion, an increase of 22.3 per cent. This is a big taxing budget&mdash;indeed, the biggest taxing budget in our history. When one looks at the increase in government revenues from $110 billion to $125.5 billion, it is only two budgets ago that $100 billion was collected for the first time. Now we are already up to $125 billion. The government's tax revenue share of GDP goes from 24.1 per cent to 25.3 per cent&mdash;and that figure comes directly from the government's own budget statements. The growth in revenue was up 7.9 per cent in the last budget. That was bad enough, but it is up another 8.9 per cent in this budget. So this is indeed a big taxing budget and it is ordinary Australians who will pay these taxes every time they go to the store, every time they want to buy something. That clearly has an impact on the whole way in which business is done in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Labor is developing a well deserved reputation for the centrality of taxes in its economic policy. No matter what the economic problem, Labor's solution is always higher taxes. The government was concerned about the recession five years ago, the recession that it would not let happen. Then it was a recession for which it pulled the levers, and it had to come. The solution in those times was mini-statements and the like to impose higher taxes. The government said that it needed higher taxes at that stage so that it could stimulate the economy, forgetting that those taxes are paid by those who could create the enthusiasm and initiative to get the economy moving again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Australian Labor Party, the solution to the recession was higher taxes. Then, when rapid growth became the problem&mdash;exactly the opposite to a recession&mdash;the solution yet again was higher taxes because the government needed to tax people more to slow the economy. It was the opposite problem, with exactly the same solution&mdash;higher taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the problem was one million unemployed, again it was said that we needed higher taxes so that the government could fund job creation schemes. It forgot that those taxes would be paid by the very businesses which could have created the jobs which would have provided long-term, lasting employment. Again the government had turned to the same solution&mdash;higher taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the problem was a record current account deficit&mdash;which is still a problem&mdash;yet again the government's solution was higher taxes, this time to depress demand. It forgot that those higher taxes would be paid by the very people who could be exporting more and thus improving our balance of payments through greater overseas sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the problem was a massive budget deficit, again the solution was higher taxes because the government simply could not afford its wild spending programs. It has forgotten that, instead of higher taxes, one solution would be to cut its own expenditure levels. If the government were to take that sort of action it would easily achieve the kind of balanced budget which is so essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intellectual dexterity that the government manages to produce to justify each new round of tax increases is amazing. No matter what the problem, it has exactly the same solution&mdash;the people will have higher taxes imposed upon them. Only the current government could hold the view that the country is better off when it pays more and more taxes to a central government to do things which, more often than not, the people of this country could do so much better themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget is noted for its so-called `surplus', which was meant to surprise the community. However, the effect of that surplus was to lead the public to the very justifiable view that the whole budget is based on fudged figures&mdash;smoke and mirrors and the like&mdash;because in reality no-one believes that the government is capable of balancing its budget and no-one believes the figures that are in this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget has been balanced in two ways. Firstly, massive tax hikes are included in the budget. I have already mentioned the 22.3 per cent increase in sales tax, but other taxes are going up as well. Individual income tax is up by 13.6 per cent. The Medicare levy is up by 18.4 per cent. Company tax is up by 15.4 per cent. The superannuation funds tax is up by 13.2 per cent. The fringe benefits tax is up another 4.4 per cent, after it went up by over 100 per cent in last year's budget. The fuel excise&mdash;that great milch cow of Labor governments&mdash;is up another 7.7 per cent. Other excise duties are up 8.8 per cent. There are massive tax increases right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other element that has created this artificial surplus is the big sell-off of government assets. Each year the federal Labor government attempts to balance its budget by selling off more and more of our national assets. Over recent years Labor has budgeted to sell the Australian National Line, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, the Commonwealth uranium stockpile, the war service land settlement scheme, the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline system, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the Commonwealth phosphate rock stockpile, overseas embassy buildings&mdash;including those in Tokyo and Paris&mdash;the defence service home loans scheme, the Avalon airfield, the ACT housing loan assistance scheme, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, repatriation hospitals, Brisbane airport land, Australian Airlines, Qantas, the Commonwealth accommodation and catering services, Williamstown dockyard, government buildings in Sydney and Melbourne, the Commonwealth Bank, Cockatoo Island, the Anzac rifle range, Australian Industry Development Corporation, Aerospace Technologies of Australia, Newington Armament Depot, and this time 18,200 cars as well. The list goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is selling off the family silver. It would not necessarily be a major issue if that money were then being used for some constructive purpose such as to retire debt, or if it were being used to re-position our economy to be more aggressive and more competitive in the years ahead. Sadly, all of these sales have been budgeted to pay for this year's unemployment benefits and this year's welfare bills. The proceeds of all those sales are being used to keep the budget alive. They are not being used to positively restructure our national economy to make our country profitable in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the government has been a dreadful salesman. It has not been able to sell many of the things it has on the list. It has not even been able to give some of them away, as the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) said on one occasion. The government has an appalling record in this area and, in fact, Qantas is being sold for the fourth time in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the government's sale record, it has only once in the last seven years achieved anything like its targeted budget estimates. In 1990-91, it managed $162 million out of a billion dollars worth of budgeted sales; in 1991-92, $311 million out of $625 million; in 1992-93, $811 million out of $1,600 million. In 1993-94, it actually sold $2.4 billion and budgeted to receive $2.4 billion. Last year, the classic of them all, $55 million was all that was achieved in asset sales, despite budgeting to receive $2.45 billion. So who believes the government when it claims it is going to sell $5.25 billion worth of assets this year? It simply will not happen, the budget will not be balanced, and so its only redeeming feature, the element that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) boasted of so proudly on budget night, will again be a dismal failure, and with it the whole basic structure of this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few days ago, the Prime Minister told small business that it does not get any better than this. The small businessmen in my electorate would say that they have known plenty of times in their life when it has been very much better than this. It may well be true to say that this Prime Minister and this government cannot get it any better than this, but that is not good enough for Australia. If this is the best they can do, it is high time they gave it away and passed government to people who can achieve better things for our country.</PARA>

Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, as you would know and others would know, I have taken a deep interest in this particular issue for some time. One of the reasons that I first took an interest in this particular issue is because, in the recent political history of Europe, particularly from the 1970s onwards, the break-up of the Yugoslavian federation and the ensuing problems that this may have caused obviously would have been a consideration in any particular study of eastern European strategy and developments.</PARA></TALK.START>

He predicted, as some others have predicted, that you would see virtually a continuation of what was occurring in the late 19th century with the nationalist revolutions, which were effectively forestalled by the First World War and then the Bolshevik revolution in Russia in 1917. Following that, there was the imposition of totalitarian regimes in some of those nations. This was seen as a future trend by commentators such as Toffler and others, but unfortunately it seems not to have been seen by those who had the responsibility for devising strategy and foreign policy on the part of many of the Western powers, in whose interest it would have been to take a greater interest in what is now occurring in the Balkans, but what could have been foreseen some time ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is widely recognised that what we need in Australia is a strong and sustained lift in savings both public and private. In his budget speech on 9 May 1995, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the principal objectives of this budget is to meet the medium term imperative of improving national saving to maintain investment and employment through the 1990s and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is the case, this budget, on the government's own terms, has been a signal failure. Dr Vince FitzGerald observed in his national saving report to the Treasurer in June 1993 that our national savings level has fallen to 16 per cent of GDP, lower than it has been since Federation, except during the two world wars and during the Great Depression. This is cause for concern in itself, since we already have a very high foreign debt and a high current account deficit adding constantly to it. Dr FitzGerald concluded that, if we do not save more, the investment necessary to ensure higher growth and more employment will only be funded by even greater recourse to foreign savings and a further build-up of foreign debt. We also need to save more because of the rapid ageing of the population which we face in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even with a relatively robust recovery from the recession of the 1980s, saving will recover only modestly. In Dr FitzGerald's words, `It is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">structurally</EMPHASIS>, not just <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">cyclically</EMPHASIS>, low.' Our underlying <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">structural</EMPHASIS> rate of national saving has fallen to around 18 per cent of GDP, five percentage points of GDP below the average of the past three decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FitzGerald report found that, while both public and private saving have fallen, the major structural decline is in public sector saving. Dr FitzGerald advocated a national savings policy that would ensure the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">sustainability</EMPHASIS> of strong ongoing growth rather than generating that growth. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stronger national saving is an essential ingredient of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">any</EMPHASIS> sustainable approach for pursuing <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ongoing</EMPHASIS> healthy growth in the economy over the mid and late 1990s and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA>He suggested that a minimum requirement for a national saving strategy is to raise national savings structurally by several per cent of GDP. But the national saving goal should be higher&mdash;to restore the underlying national saving rate over the coming decade to around the average of the past three decades, 22 to 23 per cent of GDP&mdash;that is to lift it by about five per cent of GDP&mdash;and to lift the efficiency of our investment to best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr FitzGerald said that a national saving strategy to carry out the task of reaching the goal set could comprise several broad elements. In the area of public saving, at each level of government, the general government sector should seek to move to a position of persistent significant surpluses on current transactions so as to generate positive saving and finance internally at least some government investment. The Commonwealth should seek to return its general government overall deficit to persistent surplus. Substantial reductions in outlays could be sought by moving all government service delivery programs to best practice efficiency. Cuts could also be achieved by re-ordering priorities and by means such as increased use of user charges. For Australia's public trading enterprises, the imperative is to ensure efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the strategy Dr FitzGerald recommended would include measures to address the eroding revenue base at all levels of government, including increased taxes and increased rates of taxes. The coalition does not support this as a part of a national saving strategy designed to increase national savings. To some extent, tax increases simply effect a transfer from private sector savings to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To promote private saving, low and stable inflation have to be maintained and sustained healthy growth are basic to that objective. For households, which provide the bulk of private saving, it is necessary to settle the superannuation guarantee system and ensure optimal interaction with the age pension over the years ahead. Voluntary superannuation should be promoted by shifting the balance of tax concessions from compulsory employer contributions to voluntary individual contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from this that in the budget the Government should have taken action structurally to reduce the deficit by cutting spending. The latest current account deficit of $2.252 billion is a consequence of the failure of the government to take action to address its out of control spending in previous budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On budget night, the Treasurer announced that the government would be paying the tax cuts it promised in One Nation into employees' superannuation accounts. He claimed that in doing so the government was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . delivering them in a way that significantly improves national saving.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a claim that has subsequently been debunked decisively by the experts. Additional contributions will add six per cent of wages to the superannuation of people earning around average incomes. As a result, claims the Treasurer, by the year 2002 this will build on the nine per cent contribution from employers under the superannuation guarantee arrangements, lifting the superannuation savings for a person on around average earnings to a minimum of 15 per cent of their wages. Mr Willis claimed that the government's superannuation plan:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will give Australia a comprehensive long-term private savings plan</PARA>
<PARA>and that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for a couple on average earnings, now in their mid-30s, the Government's initiatives deliver retirement incomes 75 per cent higher than the age pension.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Together with our earlier reforms, the initiatives are estimated to further increase national saving progressively by around 2 per cent of GDP per year by the end of the decade. When fully implemented, they will add 4 per cent of GDP per year to national saving. In today's values that means an increase in saving in the order of $18 billion per annum.</PARA>
<PARA>In addressing the National Press Club in Canberra on 10 May 1995, the Treasurer said of the government's superannuation plan:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also means that over and above what [a person on average weekly earnings] would otherwise have been receiving through the pension and the superannuation guarantee, [they would have] a 22 per cent increase in their retirement income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"> The government is in effect claiming that the benefits from its scheme will be: a substantial boost to national savings; higher incomes for retirees; and a more equitable distribution of superannuation benefits towards the lower paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, these claims are wrong. Employee superannuation contributions will of course raise national savings, but not by anything like three per cent of total earnings, according to an analysis of the budget by the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Many employees already contribute to their own superannuation plans, and will pay nothing more under the proposals. Not all employees will contribute. The three per cent payment is not universal, but will be introduced through awards and enterprise agreements. There will be no direct Commonwealth legislation making contributions compulsory. If employees are compelled, it will only be through changes in the terms and conditions affecting their award or enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, when employees' superannuation increases, they tend to cut back on other forms of saving. The government estimates that for each dollar put into an employee's super fund, other private savings fall by around 30c. So employee contributions will raise national savings by an amount significantly less than three per cent of earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government contributions will not lift national savings at all. The increase in superannuation savings is offset by an equal reduction in government savings and, in fact, government contributions tend to reduce national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the 30 per cent leakage from private savings, some 30 per cent of government contributions are also leaked through reductions in other savings. In the first year of maximum contributions, 2001-2002, the combination of employee and government payments will mean a net increase in new superannuation contributions of around $7.7 billion. With about $2.3 billion of that leaked away in reductions in private savings and a drop in the government's surplus of about $4.5 billion equivalent to contributions, the net gain to national savings will be around $900 million or 0.1 per cent of GDP&mdash;a far cry from the kinds of savings claimed in the budget papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The massive reported savings claimed by the government are not based on a comparison between national saving under the employee-government contributions scheme and national saving without the scheme. Instead, the budget papers misleadingly compare the effect of the proposals to what would happen if the government implemented the promised second tranche of the One Nation l-a-w law tax cuts. This is not the appropriate comparison to make. Without any corresponding cuts in government outlays, the net effect on national savings of the government's promised tax cuts would have been a loss of $5 billion. Compared to this, it is not surprising that even the very small but positive effect on national savings as a result of the government's superannuation proposals looks acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the government's own earnings projections present mixed evidence on employee benefits. From the year 2002, most employees' total super contributions will be at 15 per cent of earnings, 75 per cent higher than the previous plan for only a nine per cent employer contribution. As a result, lump sums on retirement will also be around 75 per cent higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But gross earnings are only part of the story. Since own-source income is higher, pension entitlements are reduced, and since income is higher, so is income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Treasury's estimates, under the new arrangements a male employee on average earnings who is retiring after 40 years of contributions at 15 per cent would receive an annuity worth $12,625 more than from the nine per cent employer contribution alone. But his pension entitlement would then fall by over $6,000 and his tax bill would increase by nearly $900. Of the total $12,625 increase in annuity, he is left with a net gain of $5,600. Leakage is even greater for the low paid, because the withdrawal of pension benefits has proportionally more effect. Both an employee on average weekly earnings and an employee on only 75 per cent of average earnings will be better off, in retirement, with the government and employee contributions than with employer contributions alone, but by only 22 per cent for the average income earner and 16 per cent for the lower paid worker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While employees might gladly sacrifice three per cent of earnings over 40 years for the prospect of a 75 per cent higher income in retirement, the same might not be the case when those employees realise that the real gain in income is only 16 or 22 per cent. This is especially true of low income earners, who have least to gain in retirement and who are the most likely to miss their three per cent contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government were serious about making a real contribution to national savings, it would make much greater inroads into its own underlying deficit and stop pretending that it will implement big tax cuts. If employees want to ensure a comfortable retirement, they should increase their own savings. </PARA>

Investment in a number of other areas necessarily followed, as I am particularly aware, as a representative of the Gold Coast electorate since 1984. I welcome foreign investment in my electorate for the growth in jobs in the local economy that it has provided. However, I do not welcome the source of some of that investment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not news, of course.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of us has a monopoly on what is right for the country. Each of us represents a mean figure of about 80,000 electors, who depend on us to be their voice in this parliament. Whether they voted for us or not is relatively unimportant, in terms of the appropriation debate. They are the people who expect us to represent what we see as a realistic point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I come into this debate, year in and year out, with a particular point of view&mdash;a point of view that I believe I am entitled to be heard on. I am confident&mdash;without being egotistical about this&mdash;that that general view is shared by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find most unhelpful in budget debates is not the fact that people disagree with what I am saying, but the fact that a view that is expressed by anyone is greeted with scorn and derision rather than with polite assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the problem we face as parliamentarians, particularly in an appropriation debate, is that, because the debate allows people to range over a broad width of opinion, people taking particular points of view are often being greeted by scorn and derision, rather than by objective analysis. And while that is a difficulty we all face, it tends in itself to further reduce the credibility of the parliament and the enthusiasm that people have for witnessing the debate, listening to it or, frankly, participating in it. It is fair to say, I think&mdash;and I do not intend to be unfair in my expression&mdash;that it is a characteristic that is generally enhanced by the style of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I am not suggesting by that comment that the government has a monopoly on this. But the present Prime Minister's confrontationist style tends to enhance this level where we come into these debates, put a point of view and are greeted with scorn and derision, rather than by people who are prepared to first analyse what is being said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I want to say that I come into this debate a bit distressed by the fact that, over and over again, government members have suggested that the opposition was in some way coming into the budget from a point of view that suggested that it was committed to a goods and services tax. In spite of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) could not have done more to distance himself from that policy, government members still want to run the line that the opposition is in some way married to the concept of a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the government runs that line becomes even more irritating when the government itself, in this budget, introduces something akin to a goods and services tax through the way it deals with the building industry. So opposition members find themselves very irritated by the fact that, having expressed an enthusiasm for disowning the goods and services tax, they are both branded with it and then expected to endorse legislation that introduces a broader tax base for the building industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area in which there seems to be perpetual confrontation between government and opposition is the whole question of industrial relations. I find it particularly galling to be branded with a party that is allegedly advocating a youth wage and allegedly advocating a $3-an-hour wage structure when all of this has been totally disowned by the opposition. This perception is further reinforced by the Prime Minister's constant reference to the opposition as people who do not know what it is like to represent and to work side by side with working people. The emphasis, particularly in the House of Representatives during this budget debate, on the enthusiasm of the opposition to be representing the battlers of Australia has been further eroded by the Prime Minister and those opposite who have wanted to pour scorn and derision on the opposition every time the word `battler' is mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without in any sense claiming a monopoly on the capacity we have to speak for working people, I would like to say that all of us who represent electorates that have a broad profile of Australian people, and particularly those of us who represent rural electorates, know what it is to be speaking for working people. There are few people who are marked out as battlers as much as those employed on the land in Australia. You would know that, Mr Deputy Speaker Snow, from your own experience and your own involvement as a farmer. I think it is fair for the opposition to stand up and, while not claiming a monopoly on representing battlers, to claim to be speaking for those who, frankly, cannot live on their present remuneration. Far from the opposition seeking to reduce that remuneration through its industrial relations policy, the intention is quite the contrary. The intention is to allow them to have greater remuneration as productivity increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, what does this budget do for Australians and particularly for my constituency? There are certainly those in my constituency who, I must say, welcomed the fact that the government avoided the Industry Commission interim report which recommended a change in the tax status for the Australian wine industry. The government, obviously recognising that here is an industry facing real opportunity for export growth and for generating additional export income, has not heeded the interim report. It has, in fact, been responsible in the way it has dealt with that report. We, as a parliament, now face the challenge of waiting for what this particular committee of inquiry recommends in its final report and then responsibly dealing with it so as not in any way to thwart the export growth of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has taken a number of initiatives that, frankly, have been in Australia's interests. Government and opposition have mutually stood, for example, for the reduction in tariff walls and protection in order to make this a more competitive country. What we have seen, particularly as it appears that the drought now shows signs of breaking&mdash;in some areas, I concede; I said that it shows signs&mdash;and as the opportunity for rural productivity goes up, is that in fact this has mercifully coincided with rising commodity prices, particularly in the case of the wool industry, and to a lesser extent the grain industry, as the combined efforts of the government and the opposition, through the World Trade Organisation, have allowed us greater opportunity to keep out of the markets that are traditionally ours those who have produced subsidised grain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in the wheat industry, the wool industry, the wine industry, the sugar industry, the dairy industry and even the beleaguered citrus industry, there are opportunities for export growth. I recognise that those opportunities exist because of the way in which the government has gone about its negotiations with tariffs, the GATT arrangements and now the World Trade Organisation over the last decade, but that does not alter the fact that the budget does not do what it could do to encourage productive Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget claims to be balanced when the balance, as previous speakers have said, is largely the result of asset sales. In fact the budget claims that it is likely to bring in a surplus when that surplus is largely masked by the impact of those asset sales. In my view what the budget fails to do is reduce the tax burden currently being carried by Australians so that they are themselves encouraged to be more productive. As previous speakers have indicated, and I will simply refer to these figures briefly, the reality is that during the period of this government, while wages have risen in real terms by 90 per cent, the individual tax take has gone up by 136 per cent and the sales tax burden borne by Australians has gone up by 305 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have said, `This additional revenue has allowed us effectively to develop social programs to improve the lifestyle in Australia,' but this additional revenue has also come at the expense of every productive Australian. The chasm that exists between government and opposition is such that we would say that productive Australians need to be encouraged to be more productive in order to relieve the debt and to provide a larger pie that can effectively be carved up to aid all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are facing right now is a situation in which our productivity has not gone up in sufficient measure to meet the demand of this increasing social wage. What the opposition stands for is not pruning the capacity of Australians to earn a real income but for improving their opportunity to be productive and to generate more export income for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As opposition members we are appalled at a budget that effectively leaves in place the debt. If you take away the asset sales the nation is still substantially in debt. We have in fact lost the opportunity to sell those assets again. There are members opposite who are clearly unhappy about the decision to sell the Commonwealth Bank. I cannot say that runs counter to the things that I as an opposition member believe in, but I can say that it represents an asset that the government has sold and not used of itself to generate additional productive income. It is this inconsistency between what the budget purports to deliver and what the budget effectively delivers that leaves the opposition so concerned about these appropriation bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) I would like to start with a well-known story from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aesop's fables</EMPHASIS>. The story goes like this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A shepherd's boy had gotten a roguish trick of crying; A wolf! A wolf! when there was no such matter, and fooling the country people with false alarms. He had been at this sport so many times in jest, that they would not believe him at last, when he was in earnest; and so the wolves broke in upon the flock, and worried the sheep without resistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The moral of this tale, which is age-old, is said to be that there are dangerous consequences of an improper and unseasonable fooling. The old moral observes that a common liar shall not be believed even when he speaks true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Judicious lying has always been considered part of statecraft. According to that master political tactician, Nicolo Machiavelli, a leader must:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . know well how to disguise [faithlessness]. . . and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest it is the Australian people who have been monumentally deceived by the Keating government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine a few of the government's grand statements. In the 1985 budget speech the then Treasurer, now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), said, `I've outlined the government's strategy for the new financial year. It's a strategy that builds upon our very significant success and puts further behind us the despair and economic failure of the former government.' What happened? Within months Australia was in the middle of the infamous banana republic current account crisis. In the following July, the Australian dollar collapsed to less than 60c, the lowest level on record. Since Labor came into power, the Australian currency has in fact lost almost 40 per cent of its value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1987 budget speech the current Prime Minister told us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding the enormity of the trade difficulties we have faced, our economic strategy is now bearing fruit.</PARA>
<PARA>That fruit turned out to be more like poison ivy. Within two years Australia was experiencing the largest current account blow-out on record. In the 1988 budget the current Prime Minister promised, `The nation is successfully emerging from its most severe economic crisis in a generation. This is the one that brings home the bacon. Our foreign debt burden has already stabilised and begun to fall.' What really happened? Over the following year net foreign debt rose by 22 per cent. In August 1988 the Prime Minister again declared, `Now we are well on our way back to prosperity.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1989 budget speech he promised, `As a result of the government's economic policies Australia will emerge from the recent high level of spending without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving.' But by 1990 Australia had entered the worst recession in 60 years. Never one to be daunted for long by grim reality, the Prime Minister then declared, `This is a recession, a slow-down, Australia had to have.' Still, we were assured, `Nobody's going to get hurt; it's going to be a soft landing.' Some soft landing for the million unemployed or for the 700,000 Australians who are still today out of work. What we had had, according to the Prime Minister, was too much of a good thing. He said insightfully, in his usual elegant English, in January 1990, `Too much of a good thing can still be too much of a good thing. I mean, basically the glass is too full and the effervescence is spilling over the sides, and that effervescence is the current account and inflation.' He seemed to be confusing the Australian economy with the soluble Disprin, although the analogy is not far wrong because the economy has been heavily sedated by this government, as well as the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is more. The current Prime Minister claimed at another press conference in the same period, `In three years there will be no government debt, domestic or external. It is an enormous claim that I can make on behalf of the government of Australia. I'd doubt there is any other OECD economy that will not have any bonds on issue at all.' The only thing the Prime Minister was right about, as usual, was that it was an enormous claim. It was also an utterly fraudulent claim, because the current account deficit now stands at $27 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A little later, in February 1993, Prime Minister Keating announced, `I think Australia has already crossed the Rubicon. Exports are still going gang busters. I mean, it's been a revolution. This is a much more productive country. It's now enmeshed truly with the rest of the world economy as it never was before 1983.' The allusion to the Rubicon was a little classical for the member for Blaxland. Talking about squashing things with his fist or his boot when they prove recalcitrant or pesky is more his post-Weimar Republic style. The thing he omitted from this pronouncement was that, if exports were doing all right, imports were doing even better, more than cancelling out the effect of the exports on our trade balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remark about being enmeshed with the world is, too, not so good as it might portend. Basically, what it means is that, while we are playing the trade game according to the rules of the level playing field, other nations are playing according to the rules of a bumpy, if not downright mountainous, playing field. When there is a lot of foreign debt because people are so taxed and incentives for saving have been taken away, we end up extremely enmeshed in the rest of the world and vulnerable to every ill wind that blows upon our shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, in the full flight of an election campaign, this Labor government promised tax cuts. These were to compete with what was offered by the coalition but Labor's tax cuts were advertised as all gain and no pain. In fact, as it has turned out, it would have been truthful to say that they would be all pain and no gain. Prime Minister Keating told us that he would deliver tax cuts in two rounds, costing about $3.5 billion each. There were impeccable reasons for reducing marginal tax rates which have succoured the bulk of Australian workers. To pay Australia's top rate of marginal income tax, which is almost 50 per cent in Australia, people only have to earn $35,000. In Japan, for example, people have to earn $250,000 to incur the top rate of tax. So the Prime Minister announced that new tax scales would be introduced in two stages on 1 July 1994 and 1 January 1996. He said that the fundamental objectives of these tax scales were to reduce the marginal rate facing the great majority of the full-time work force, including those on medium and average wages, from 38 per cent to 30 per cent and to reduce the marginal tax rate for those earning up to $50,000 per year, including, for example, those who derive such income through overtime or shift loadings, from 46 per cent to 44 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister later declared in the face of criticism that tax cuts were pie in the sky: they are a promise; they are law, l-a-w law. Of course, the l-a-w law is more like a l-i-e lie as the shadow Treasurer has pointed out. The first round for people earning less than $700 a week took place but only by raising taxes by almost as much. Since the 1993 federal election, Prime Minister Keating has jacked up taxes by around $3 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the most recent budget, we have been told what we had always suspected, that the tax cuts for the bulk of the population have been relegated to the land of the never-never. They were never-never going to happen. They were a convenient fiction, the rabbit in the hat. We are now regaled with a new trick. This is called `super super on the never-never.' It does not start until July 1997, 18 months after the second round of tax cuts were due, and the government's full three per cent contribution, which is only for earners under $46,000 a year, does not come into effect until July 1999. But, of course, any real benefits of this total scheme do not come until the year 2042. This is government on the never-never. By then the member for Blaxland will either be dead or in a very expensive nursing home somewhere like Monte Carlo. As the shadow Treasurer said, it is all very surreal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The super is being sold as very super, with the government telling the people on its pre-election road show that they will get golden handshakes of over $400,000 just like top executives. People are, of course, thrilled because they really do want to believe their government is doing the best for them. But, as super analysts are saying, if super funds yield a long-term yearly average of four per cent, which is realistic on past performance in this country, a 40-year participant would retire in 2042 with just over $153,000, which is not quite enough to buy an annuity equivalent to the current old age pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should we believe this government? On the basis of its past record, `super' super will never eventuate in the form which it is advertised. The likelihood is that the government contributions will never materialise. There will always be some good reason to resist honouring that pledge. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the original pre-selection of the member for Blaxland is straight out of Machiavelli. It was doubtful that he would win pre-selection, and his mate, the current Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), drove off with the ballot boxes on the pillion of his motorbike. When he returned with them, it was found that the present member for Blaxland had the votes&mdash;he had the votes in the box. There is a pertinent passage, on which I wish to conclude, in Machiavelli's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Prince</EMPHASIS>, which tells how a military commander, the crafty son of a potter, one morning assembled the people and the senate of Syracuse:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the republic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators and the richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held the princedom of that city without any civil commotion.</PARA>
<PARA>The talking up of a republic, as with everything else in this government's bandbox, is not what it seems. We should be prepared  for more truths of the l-a-w law variety in the Prime Minister's statement this week. We will accept them at this country's peril. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On every occasion that I rise in this place I find there is cause for concern about this procedure. This afternoon I have two concerns. Firstly, I think it is totally inappropriate for the appropriation bills to be debated in this Main Committee. As far as I am concerned, there is nothing more important in the deliberations that affect Australians than the annual presentation of the general government direction, as outlined within the budget. Although there is continuity, as a result of the arrangements with the states, and in salaries, wages and in ongoing commitments at a federal level, the budget is the most important parameter by which the public at large can get some idea of just what the government is up to, where they are going to be called on to fund its services, and the way in which their own lives and economic and social conditions will be affected or prejudiced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most inappropriate that this Main Committee should be the place where that document is discussed. It is even more so this afternoon, when there is a matter of prime importance going on in the main chamber. Yet this chamber continues: it is irrelevant. It is important that the people of Australia understand that under Labor, sadly, the parameters of parliamentary discussion and the importance of parliament are progressively being eroded. I do not agree with this trend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this chamber should be adjourned, so that we can all go and participate in the debate in the main chamber. It is no use saying that members will not be able to participate in the appropriation debate unless they take the opportunity to speak now. The only reason that is so is through government maladministration, expressing exactly the same incompetence in matters of the administration of the parliament as in administering the country. It is really a farce that we are up here, a few of us talking in isolation, albeit that it is telecast within parliament. The parliament and the nature of our democracy are too important for the main chamber to be seen to be other than the place where we all should be, and where matters of prime importance should be discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I want to say a few things about the Appropriation Bill No. 1 1995-96 and a few things generally about government administration. The first thing that concerns me about the bill is that there seems to be a total lack of understanding by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) as to what is happening out there in rural Australia. I know that on other occasions I have spoken about the extent to which there has been a decline in the terms of trade affecting Australia's commodity producers. If one had a look at the Dresner commodity index one would see that, apart from the odd exception, prices are falling significantly. Indeed, only today we learnt of the collapse of sugar prices and the impact that this will have on the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years that Labor has been in office, first under Prime Minister Hawke and now under Prime Minister Keating, there has been a tendency to look only to what are called the new industries, the so called `smart' industries, the elaborately transformed manufactures, or ETMs as they are known in the jargon of the people in trade. But they are not the only basis on which this country lives and survives. Indeed, were it not for our commodity exports, this country would be in an even worse financial state, and be indebted to an even greater degree than it is today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just an economic cost but a social and educational cost that this government ignores, and ignores at Australia's peril. I mentioned educational cost last in that trilogy but really it is in education that more and more I am seeing the consequences of the drought and the recession we had to have. The drought has certainly eroded the incomes of small business people and the family farmers. Farmers generally, and people in small communities, have the same right to the educational process as everybody else in this community. Indeed, in the rhetoric of these days, one rather expects that, unless you are a minority, and a vocal one at that, you have no chance of attracting government's attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, there are many people who are deprived of an ordinary educational opportunity simply because of the drought and economic recession. It is no use the government saying, `We have modified the conditions of our aid program for students so that those who have capital but no income are not disadvantaged.' It is true that there have been modifications within the aid to students, but they do not address the fundamentals of those who are forced to leave their education and go back to run the farm; they do not address the fundamentals of those who find they cannot stay on at university or receive a tertiary or even a secondary education simply because they know they have got to go out into the work force to try to keep the family going. That is happening in far too many cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been the case in this country that those who live in remote areas are to a greater degree disadvantaged more than those in the closer areas. But today both share in the disadvantages of the educational system as it affects people through the assistance that the government provides and generally in the opportunities they have for equality with those in the city. It applies as much as anything from the long since introduced Dawkins reduction in assistance for residential accommodation in universities. If you live a long way from a university, you cannot go and get education on the same basis as everybody else, and yet the assistance that used to be provided for halls of residence has been removed and there is a fundamental problem in the inequalities of education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To highlight that problem, I have looked at some figures that the manufacturers have produced. When we look at the extent to which they see things changing, we note that they are in a not much different position, particularly the small business people, who really are the life blood of this country. The Prime Minister the other day dismissed them as never having had it so good. If anything, that statement yet again underlined the trauma that there is for people out there totally ignored by the principal ministers of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In manufacturing we have real problems because, quite contrary to the Prime Minister's statement, according to a survey by the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales and a State Bank of New South Wales quarterly survey, business conditions, sales and profitability have fallen to levels that have not been seen since March 1993. When we look through the performance generally and we see why that is so, we find that, just as in primary industry, to quote from that survey:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary factors inhibiting small manufacturers from investing are government taxes and charges and the rise in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>I wanted to set that climate because there seems at the moment to be a bit of a tendency to suggest that interest rates have now peaked and are going to fall. I noticed a particularly optimistic statement from the National Farmers Federation the other day suggesting that was so. I do not know whether it has any better reason than anybody else for making a suggestion of that character but there have already been three interest rate increases. There has already been an increased burden on those who are self-employed, the family farmers and the small business sector, and they are now being saddled with a plethora of additional charges that this budget produces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget comes on top of those three increased interest rates. Even if interest rates fall, nobody is suggesting that they will go back to where they were. With our overseas debt as it is and with our chronic adverse balance of payments deficit, there is certainly no suggestion that we are going to get our economy to a position where once again we might be able to expect that our interest rates will be competitive with the United States or with any of those other OECD countries against whom we are compared and with whom we obviously always need to compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my worry that this budget has done nothing for small business and done nothing for the family farmer. It has really only yet again reasserted the fact that they are the neglected segment of the Australian community. When we look at the changes in this budget, we see that their position is further aggravated. The Medicare levy has increased&mdash;I will come back to health if I get time&mdash;and there are sales tax increases on motor vehicles. The tax on building materials really introduces a GST. It is no use the government saying, `But you were going to introduce a 15 per cent GST'&mdash;I wish we could have a debate on that&mdash;because, significantly, we were going to change Australia's tax system fundamentally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern with the GST was not with its ingredients but with the fact that it was presented far too rigidly and it was not put forward as being the fundamental way by which we could get a total change in Australia's tax structure. Unless we do that, we are going to be saddled even more with the sorts of increments that this budget represents&mdash;sales tax increases, company tax increases, increases that affect, either directly or indirectly, everybody in the community. One of the taxes, that on light fuel, has particular relevance to the rhetoric we have heard from the Prime Minister over the weekend and today about the standard gauge link between Melbourne and Adelaide. I will return to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses and family farmers, like everybody else, are going to pay more sales tax. As a result of the increase in company tax, they will pay in another way for that increase. They are going to pay more in their Medicare levy, and as of 1 July they will have yet another sales tax increase. In the parameter of operating Australia, and as we go into an election, it is quite critical that people understand that the important component of Labor, in its budget, in its political utterance, is that it will care for its own and to hell with the rest of them. Sadly, those who are the most important element in getting Australia moving again happen to be in the rest of them. It is that particular group for whom I feel at the moment: there is absolutely no hope for them under a Labor government. There is one reason why people out there ought to understand why Labor is long past the stage of being able to contribute to Australia's advancement and that is because it is prepared to neglect that important, vital element of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to look at the budget deficit because this is another part of its presentation that I am concerned with. There is no doubt that, if the government had been able to achieve that $700 million surplus that it claims, it would have been a remarkable achievement. I have looked through to try to find how it was made up. I was interested to hear that a few people have even tried to find out where the figures were and, of course, they are not there. I am interested in the fact that Bain and Co. have disaggregated and extracted a number of one-off factors. It has shown that the real deficit is $12.5 billion. Let me just identify those because I think that is another part of the way in which this government operates. It ignores elements important to the community and is prepared to deceive people into believing that, in some way, things are different from what they really are. That is what the debate is about in the main chamber at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advertised surplus is $0.7 billion. Let us take off the asset sales which have been extensively canvassed during this appropriation debate. The government has them down at $5.4 billion, which is a totally unrealistic figure in the circumstances. The Qantas sale is going on at the moment but it is a distortion of reality to look at Qantas other than as an asset which is not being presented in its true light. There are all sorts of implications from the deal done with New Zealand to prevent the introduction of Air New Zealand into Australia, as was originally agreed, to the way in which Qantas services have been reduced and the way in which funds are not being provided to allow the purchase of new aircraft to take advantage of the present surge in aircraft passenger traffic. I think it is quite ridiculous to look at Qantas as being worth the money that the government is putting on it. But, in any event, it has been presented for the third time in this budget as an asset sale. For the government to expect to get $5.4 billion out of it is absolutely farcical. Repayment of state government debt is $1.8&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my remarks I have tried to canvass the fact that the budget does nothing for rural Australia or small business. I have regretted the fact that the recession still continues there, that it has a social fallout that is even greater than the economic one, and that the budget does nothing towards it. I was identifying the sham that the budget surplus in fact represents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we adjourned, I was quoting from Bain and Co. which showed the items which constitute the $12.5 billion real deficit. I have mentioned the asset sales of $5.4 billion. Bain and Co. included the repayment of state government debt at $1.8 billion. In fact, this is only a bookkeeping entry. Public enterprise superannuation is down, at $1 billion, which again is a bookkeeping entry. Reserve Bank dividends certainly is a book entry and it includes, of course, an increase in the interest being charged to the trading banks on unutilised funds. That goes up by&mdash;I think&mdash;half a billion dollars. The Reserve Bank dividends are $2.1 billion. There are government enterprise dividends of $1.3 billion and company tax advance payments are $1.6 billion. If we exclude all of those&mdash;as probably we should&mdash;we finish with a deficit of $12.5 billion, which is the real position of this budget. So all the rhetoric about having a surplus is no more than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just before concluding, I want to identify one of the areas where the sham of the budget is best portrayed. As the minister who finally managed to get the trans-Australian standard gauge line in place, I feel quite strongly about some of the rhetoric over the course of this weekend on the very commendable link of the standard gauge between Adelaide and Melbourne. Let there be no doubt that the late Malcolm Summers, who was then secretary to the Department of Shipping and Transport, would be delighted to know that, so long after, one of those dreams that he had and that I shared for a link around Australia has finally been concluded. For all that I disagree with the Prime Minister on many issues, he has said that conflicts between state rail authorities have really been the impediment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look at the nature of the $184 million payment and at some of the implications that there are in this budget. When I look through the budget papers, I notice that one item is the increase in excise on light fuel oils. Honourable members will remember, in Budget Paper No. 1, page 416, the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative amendments will be introduced in the budget sittings to change the definition of fuel oil to exclude so-called light fuel oils which are, in fact, industrial diesel fuels. This measure will begin from 1 July and result in these fuels being excised at the diesel rate.</PARA>
<PARA>You might well say that those people who have been trying to change from the excisable diesel fuel to light fuel oils deserve to pay the price, but there is a cost. Part of the cost is represented in the change from distillate to light fuel oil that state rail authorities and the Australian National Rail Corporation have made with their own locomotives. One of the reasons why the rail authorities have made this change is that this government has been extracting approximately the amount that standard gauge rail costs year by year, by way of diesel fuel excise, from the railways! The government has been doing so without in any way contributing to building up standard gauge railways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The weekend farce occurred because the government is, by way of diesel fuel excise, year by year taking the amount that standard gauge connection costs. I am all in favour of it being done, but I wish to goodness the government would be honest. Indeed, if honourable members read the March 1990 paper by the Interstate Commission `Road use charges and vehicle registration: A national scheme', volume 1, at page 180, they will find a comment that this government should have in mind. In relation to diesel use by rail, the commission states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such fuel should be regarded as an input to production rather than as an end consumption and hence should not be taxed for general revenue purposes. Rail operations do impose externalities that would be inappropriately recovered through fuel excise duty.</PARA>
<PARA>The Interstate Commission is not the only agency to pursue this line of argument. In its report on rail, the Industry Commission states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a general principle, the commission argues against levying any such tax on fuel to be used as an intermediate input. Consistent with this, the commission is of the view that railways should not be required to pay excise on diesel used for freight purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>That admonition was published in 1990. Although I have, unfortunately, been able to get figures only for the period when the actual amount taken from the railways by the Commonwealth by way of diesel fuel excise was $118 million, from the papers I have been able to obtain, I understand that, with inflation and with changes in diesel fuel excise, the amount is now closer to between $180 million and $200 million per year. The cost of the standardised link between Adelaide and Melbourne is $184 million, and, year by the year, the Commonwealth is taking, by way of diesel fuel excise, this amount of money. This is totally unjustified, and, of course, it is against what the Interstate Commission says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is a sham and a farce. This budget ignores the important elements of Australian society which, sadly, are still languishing in recession. This is a budget which does not entitle the government to go to the people and to say that Australia is now on the road to recovery. This is a budget which, sadly, is increasing the impost on ordinary Australians; the battlers about whom we have heard so much in the last few days. It is the battlers who suffer at the hands of this Labor government. </PARA>

One needs to look no further than the way it calculates the so-called surplus to understand what I mean. I will come back to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the opposition that is criticising this budget. There is a wide range of people from a wide range of community organisations who are criticising the budget for what it says. I just quote from one or two of those. In the area of jobs the president of ACOSS, Robert Fitzgerald, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But what the budget won't do is break the cycle of poverty or address the issues of inequality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While we acknowledge the government's commitment to maintaining Working Nation's outcomes, one has to seriously question whether they can be delivered, given these massive cuts. I think that the public has to be very cautious about accepting that line.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the first point, in the areas of jobs. In the area of indigenous peoples, the chair of ATSIC, Lois O'Donoghue, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By transferring responsibility for Aboriginal health away from ATSIC the states and territories will see this as a Commonwealth responsibility and not their responsibility. The transfer is certainly an abrogation of, I guess, what ATSIC was set up for, to enable indigenous Australians to make decisions about their lives. To mainstream functions doesn't give us confidence that the government is serious about reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is point 2. In relation to business, Ian Spicer, of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a high-spending, high-taxing budget and overall business will be very disappointed. The government have squibbed on the hard task of cutting expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>Paul Barrett, the executive director of the Business Council of Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increased revenue measures of $2.4 billion fall primarily on business and are a disguised attack on the present and future incomes of ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>In the area of health, the new president of the Australian Medical Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We welcome the public health initiatives in this budget such as immunisation strategy, the focus on youth suicide&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>both of which the opposition would support&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but we really feel that these are bits of tinsel on top of a rotten Christmas tree. The budget does nothing to address the basic structural problems in health care financing. In particular, we point to the Medicare levy rise, the absence of any initiatives to increase private health insurance membership . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So it is not just the opposition that is speaking, but a wide range of those in the community in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the arithmetic gymnastics and the so-called surplus. That surplus is highly dependent upon asset sales. As my colleague the shadow minister for finance, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), has pointed out on a number of occasions since that budget was brought down, one has only to look at the government's record in terms of asset sales to see exactly where it is not heading. In 1990-91 the asset sales estimate was $1,000 million. What has been achieved&mdash;$161.7 million. In 1991-92, where the government's estimate was $625 million, it achieved less than 50 per cent of that&mdash;$301.8 million. In 1992-93 it estimated $1,600 million and achieved $801 million. In 1993-94, which is the only year when the government actually achieved, it predicted $2,400 million and achieved $2,470 million. In 1994-95, the current financial year, $2,450 million is what was estimated. What has been achieved so far&mdash;$55 million. What does the government predict in 1995-96? Wait for it: $5,350 million. With that sort of record how could one possibly believe the government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is a little example. Table 1 is to do with outlays by function. In the defence area for 1995-96, the budget we are debating, there will be an outlay of $9.992 billion for defence. That compares to the public debt interest outlays of $10.077 billion. So, as my colleague the shadow minister for defence science and personnel pointed out, the defence of our nation is subsumed by public debt interest payments. I think that is a very salient point to recognise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not where it finishes. The government claims that it has achieved a surplus by expenditure restraint. The simple fact is that real outlays, excluding asset sales, are projected to grow by 1.7 per cent in 1995-96. Revenue is expected to grow 8.9 per cent in the financial year. In the last 20 years the only occasions on which revenue growth has been higher than this were in 1973-74, the first Whitlam budget, and the second Keating budget, of 1984-85. Those are two salient features that people seem to skirt around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point, I suppose, is the current account deficit. The current account deficit is stuck at $27 billion and that, of course, will impact on interest rates. We will wait and see where that heads, bearing in mind that in the last financial year the government predicted, what, a $14 billion deficit&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the specifics of the budget, three or four years ago, in the depths of the recession, the building industry was the only thing that kept my area out of the depths of that recession. It was a relatively buoyant housing industry. Over the last five or six months, with interest rate pressures, that has disappeared. I think it is all said in letters I got from a lot of people over the last few days, and I quote from one of them:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are some of this country's troubled and overtaxed small business people, carpenters, builders, cabinet-makers, joiners and all those associated with the home construction industry. This government is totally unaware of the real economic climate that is causing despair and total ruin of many business. The 12 per cent sales tax on all cupboard work involved on all building sites is surely the death knell to many of our struggling workshops. Not only does this raise the cost of homes by thousands overall, not the $400 as is suggested, but now gives the backyarder another 12 per cent advantage. We cannot see sound management in the idea of sending businesses to the wall, placing scores of workers on the dole queues. We are asking you to go to bat for us, our representative, to halt this madness and to restore some sanity in this insane tax mad government. Please give us your highest priority as workshops are closing almost by the week in our area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond briefly to a few of the matters raised by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). I note at the outset that he made no contribution at all, in terms of the actual appropriation for the four departments that we are discussing here. First of all, there has been agreement reached between the government and the opposition to facilitate the discussion process through each of the areas of appropriation that are outlined here. The member for Mitchell spent the first couple of minutes attacking the process, and the last three minutes in talking about what happened in the last election campaign. He did not even come close to talking about the actual appropriations that we are dealing with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the particular matters that were raised relating to pensions and promises, there are a few things that are worth noting. First of all, the government made a commitment that it was going to keep pensions about 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. That commitment has been honoured in full. Indeed, pensions today stand at something like 25.2 to 25.3 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We made other commitments in respect of part-rate pensioners, in that we would take steps to ensure that all part-rate pensioners received the full fringe benefits. The situation is confirmed in this budget: all part-rate pensioners, even with a dollar of pension, receive the full fringe benefit, including the health card and all of the facilities that go with the health card. Compare that to the previous government&mdash;which the member for Mitchell was part of&mdash;where pensions fell to about 22 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mitchell referred to the appeal funds commitment made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in 1992, which was designed to directly assist groups that had their key fund raising in the period leading up to Christmas. These charity groups were obviously feeling the strain, because of the impact of demands made by many welfare groups at that time, due to the recession. The government not only met that commitment in full, in fact, the appropriations at that time carried an expansion of the money to match additional funds that were carried over past the December 1992 period, as some of the charities came forward with acquittals in early 1993. My recollection is that this meant an additional allocation on the part of the Commonwealth in the tens of millions, although I cannot recall the exact figure. The member for Mitchell is quite wrong in the assertion he made in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made clear its ongoing commitment to Medicare. It has spelt out in the appropriations its strong commitment to the maintenance of Medicare, and its strong commitment to the public health system. That has been confirmed in successive budgets since that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the particular appropriations that we are dealing with here, the budget papers make clear that the government is committed to ensuring that the area of running costs is dealt with as firmly as is possible. There are further stringencies placed on running costs in this particular budget, in respect to the appropriations for the other agencies that are outlined in this first grouping. The fact that the member for Mitchell had nothing to contribute by way of any criticism of those measures suggests that they should be supported by the committee. I commend them to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard my colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) refer to the crowd opposite, who were at us in 1993 about the GST. We are going to hound the government about the `KST'&mdash;Keating's sales tax, particularly `KST' in the building industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) knows that the KST is already impacting on the building industry in south-east Queensland. In my region, as I said before, we had a buoyant housing industry until six or seven months ago. The impact of the interest rate pressures was just starting to feed through and now, on top of that, we have the 12 per cent building tax. My office has received a lot of correspondence and a lot of telephone calls about this tax in the last few days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's situation is indefensible. On the one hand the government criticises the opposition about the GST, while on the other hand it is open to justifiable criticism for imposing the building tax. It is about revenue. It is about nothing else. The government knows that. The Keating government has just king-hit the building industry in south-east Queensland. I would be interested to hear the response from those opposite on that particular point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of health, I referred earlier to chronic fatigue syndrome. I am delighted that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) is sitting opposite. I hope he will take my comments on board&mdash;and perhaps the department is already doing so. Everybody is aware of chronic fatigue syndrome, but nobody wants to own that particular condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the whole debate is being complicated by a lack of detailed knowledge of the nature of chronic fatigue syndrome. On the research effort that is going into that, I would be interested to hear from the parliamentary secretary, in response to the budgetary allocation, as to what degree the National Health and Medical Research Council is addressing CFS or ME, and perhaps MND&mdash;motor neurone disease&mdash;as well. What is the NHMRC doing in those areas? I ask that question not only as the federal member for Groom, but also as the patron of the local branches of the ME, CFS and MND associations. I would be interested to hear what the parliamentary secretary has to say on that. In particular, I would like to hear about the impact of that condition in the disability area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of a particular case. We do not have time to go into the detail of it now, but I will raise it separately in another debate. It is a very desperate case of a lady who has been denied a disability support pension simply because of the question marks over the nature of CFS and the continuing argument in medical circles about whether or not it is a valid condition. I am not competent to make a judgment on that, but the parliamentary secretary might say something about that when he speaks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally in the health area, I reinforce for the benefit of those opposite what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said as recently as yesterday about health services. He said that when this coalition is in government there will be no change to Medicare or to bulk-billing, but there certainly will be some initiatives to lift the game in terms of private health insurance schemes. I cannot say, nor will I say, anything more at this stage, other than to invite the parliamentary secretary to respond to some of those points. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In terms of housing and regional development, I am sure the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) would acknowledge the amount of money that has been put into south-east Queensland, particularly through the better cities program and also the projected moneys that will go there, which are of the order of $200 million to $300 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major projects in that area are the Gold Coast rail link plus the urban transport link. Those projects involve an examination of the whole notion of housing development and areas related to that. We are all looking at that through the urban review. The local governments are also looking to streamline their planning processes and they are working upon ways to operate in a more realistic way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just say to the honourable member for Groom that regional development is very definitely about local leadership. McKinsey showed that, as did Kelty and Lindsay Fox, who pointed out that, where regions are growing, where regions are developing, they have local leadership. I would urge the honourable member for Groom to be involved in the processes of regional development, to address those issues of housing, to address the urban reviews that are occurring, to address the lifestyle issues, be they in terms of greening or of waste management. I know that the honourable member for Groom and I need more water to manage, given that we are in areas where there is severe drought, very strict drought, but I think this budget offers an opportunity for local government and local regions to be major players in all the processes of government and to address these national agenda issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are issues of planning, issues of the way in which people live&mdash;be they housing or public transport or infrastructures and local infrastructures&mdash;that need to be moved along. Contrary, I suggest, to the views of the honourable member for Groom, housing within that south-east corner has developed but there has also been an oversupply. I think everybody would recognise, certainly in terms of home units or apartments and so on, the oversupply which exists between the Gold Coast and southern Brisbane and up through to the Toowoomba area. That is one of the problems that people are having and trying to blame on a whole range of other problems&mdash;a basic lack of planning in the nature of housing that people actually want and the kind of housing that people actually want, and along with that go the necessary infrastructures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the issues that are generally addressed in this housing and regional development budget. I know that the opposition finds it very difficult to find anything adverse to say about this. Who can speak up and say that we should not have $487 million in terms of the better cities program, decried it was by some people in the opposition from the very first? Having seen the program now actually in action and having seen it operate, people recognise that in very poor areas, in very badly planned areas, the kind of planning and the kind of change in lifestyle which have occurred through the better cities processes are being moved along. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1995-96, I want to say a few words on human services and health. Let me begin by commending the government for the expenditures in this area and, indeed, in housing and regional development and all the other main social areas of the government. If one looks at the social justice statement which was supplied with the budget one finds a comprehensive statement of all the social programs of the government which were very important in the further promotion of social justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These terms `social justice' and `social wage' are very important because, as we saw in the House earlier today, there was a debate about a social wage. It was very interesting that in that debate there was an allegation by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) that he had been misquoted. But in the speech that he gave on that debate, not once did he ever talk about the social wage. Not once did he talk about what the social wage means. Not once did he use the term `social justice'. </PARA>

I would like members of the opposition to tell me one single writer, one person who supports their party, who has ever written about or discussed the questions of social justice or a social wage. Never! Then they get up and try to talk about battlers. </PARA>

Every election, `We're getting rid of Medicare.' Every election, `We're going to dismantle Medicare.' Then what happened? At the last election the Australian people said, `We want Medicare.' Finally, as a result of that, they decided, belatedly&mdash;not in their hearts, not because they have understood something about social justice&mdash;to tell us, `Oh, well, now we want Medicare.' After all those years!</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am thankful that the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) has deferred to me to allow me to say something about the fraud which has been perpetrated on the people of Queensland by the allocation of the so-called 4,200 extra university places; a fraud which is perpetrated on country people. I have expressed my fears about this situation for some time. There are 4,200 extra places, but, if these places are broken up over three years, and if the number of places is then broken up into the places which have to go to new universities in south-east Queensland, to Sippy Downs, to the extension of Griffith University on the Gold Coast and to the possible extension of the University of Queensland to Ipswich, it is obvious that 2,600 places have to go into that south-east corner just to keep pace. That leaves a total of 1,600 places for the rest of Queensland, of which 700 places will not be announced for another year or so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have found that, for the nine country universities&mdash;those from Toowoomba through Wide Bay, Burnett and Central Queensland to James Cook in North Queensland and its other campus at Cairns&mdash;the state of Queensland received 900 places spread over nine campuses over three years. Big deal! My area of Central Queensland has been given 420 extra places. The absolute minimum for Central Queensland is 500 places, and the academics at the University of Central Queensland are asking for an absolute minimum of 700 or 800 places. However, what do we find? We find that the 420 places are already bodgied up with 100 places which were pre-announced by the current Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) three years earlier. Out of this budget proper, we are allocated 320 places which are spread over five campuses. What a fraud! This is an area where, on a student to population ratio, we are allocated only 50 per cent of the Australian average of university places. Honourable members should note that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all this trumpeting, how many places does the Central Queensland area end up with? Our area ends up with 60 per cent. This area is so far behind the average for the rest of Australia that the situation is an utter disgrace. The allocation of the extra spaces is purported to be a great saviour, but my ALP opponent has not been very sage-like about the situation. My opponent jumped in boots-and-all and said what a marvellous thing it is. When I explained in the media what is to happen in our own area, and when the academics came out and agreed with me, my opponent ran one line in a newspaper in Bundaberg, and, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gladstone Observer</EMPHASIS>, he stated that he is not pleased with the allocation. Once the situation with the places is explained to them, even ALP candidates are shown what a fraudulent situation it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is announcing things far in advance and then the government blocks them up, puts them one year forward or pulls them one year back. The government tops the places up when it suits the government to do so. By the time the government gets to the point of delivery, no-one quite remembers what they have got, and the universities and the regional campuses which are desperately in need of places do not know what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a classic case of a similar nature in the state budget, and I use it as an example of how the ALP got away with murder. The Bundaberg police station has been announced in four consecutive budgets. It was also announced in the state budget that the Bundaberg Base Hospital, which has had three front-page stories each announcing a $18.1 million new hospital development, is to be allocated $2.8 million. Of the $18.1 million which was originally announced, the hospital was allocated $2.8 million when the time came. That amount of money will not deliver one major building on the hospital campus. The universities are in the same situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a government of perpetual announcements, perpetual topping up and perpetual backing and filling. The situation with university places in Central Queensland is a disgrace and the allocation of 320 places over five campuses should be condemned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond to the matters raised by the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville). In his contribution he did not focus all his attention on higher education but decided to talk about police stations and hospitals. They are not a part of this appropriation. That reflects the fact that the opposition does not want to talk about what has been a tremendous achievement in higher education over the last 12 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the number of students who complete secondary school and go on to higher education today compared with the number in 1983, taking Queensland as an example, there has been a huge turnaround in the number who complete secondary school and a massive increase in the number of new university places that have been provided. Indeed, the growth in university places across Australia over the last decade has been large enough to warrant the creation of another dozen or so educational institutions at higher education level. So the measures over the last 10 years have been substantial. The measures in this budget represent a further commitment by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of additional places will be created in the 1996-98 triennium, and yet the member for Hinkler attempts to make some debating point about the fact that those arrangements are phased. That has always been the case. Announcements are made now for some years down the track. Obviously, growth regions such as Queensland, western Sydney&mdash;which the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), I and others represent&mdash;other parts of Queensland where there are high levels of growth, Western Australia, and the north coast of New South Wales, have all been keen to get more places. There is no argument about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contents of this budget provide precisely those things. In the budget, it was made clear that there was going to be a strong additional commitment to providing places in Queensland. There was also a strong commitment to the growth regions of New South Wales and Western Australia. The government also ensured that the growth in those places, for which we are providing 5,850 new higher education places in the 1996-98 period, is being achieved without substantial impacts as far as HECS is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, none of the fees which students feared, and which they were campaigning about prior to the budget, have been introduced, and that was done without detriment to states such as Victoria and South Australia either. Queensland will receive 1,750 new places in 1996, a further 1,500 places in 1997 and 950 in 1998. No-one can say that the growth demand in Queensland&mdash;which no-one would argue with&mdash;is not being responded to by the government. It is being responded to. There are also further measures in the budget that recognise increased participation access requirements in Western Australia and New South Wales as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we compared the approach of the government to that of the opposition&mdash;to the extent that we have a policy from the opposition in these areas&mdash;what would the opposition's approach be? I presume it would go back to what was offered in Fightback, with the emphasis on a user-pays approach, with vouchers and those sorts of arrangements to pay for higher education. How anyone could suggest that that adds to the access and equity issues of the growth centres in Queensland, I am not too sure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I do know is that the government has made a strong commitment to add to the places in the growth centres. That strong commitment is recognised by the fact that the budget announcements ensure 5,850 new higher education places in the 1996-98 triennium. We also made it clear that a substantial additional injection would be made into the TAFE system, as well as providing the reinforcing measures that are contained in the budget relating to improving accessibility in terms of the transition between school and TAFE, the ANTA arrangements, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the allocations in this area of higher education, the growth centres do very well out of this budget. The government is maintaining its commitment to ensure proper access to the places that are needed in Queensland and in all the other growth areas of Australia. Those arrangements must be continued.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few words about the Department of Social Security and I may have some time to deal with some aspects of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. For even the truest believers in the government the real crunch must have come with the release of the Gregory study which showed that under Labor the rich have got rich and the poor have got poorer. There could be no more damning indictment of the government than after 12 years of programs, programs, programs&mdash;a program for every problem, most of which the government created in the first place&mdash;this is the outcome. It is unarguable. The facts are there: the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer. No more evidence is needed of the abject failure of the economic and social policies of this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has put in place the preconditions for a permanent underclass, despite all of the programs. A moment ago I was listening to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) raving on about the social wage. We debated that in the parliament today. These programs all comprise the social wage. In this country we have ended up with what is effectively a welfare state which has failed to delivery anything but dependency. When those opposite rave on about the social wage that is what they are talking about. There are many people in this country now receiving the social wage. I cannot see that that is something to crow about; it is something of which the government ought to be ashamed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people in this country are now absolutely dependent on what those opposite call the social wage. I wonder whether it is intentional. I assume the government has gone about creating this situation where more and more people are locked into the government system, relying each week, fortnight, month or whatever on the government's handouts just to survive. Is that the sort of Australia that the we really want to create? It is the sort of Australia that the government has ended up creating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me ask the one big question that is on the lips of most people about the budget: where are my tax cuts? We will not let those opposite forget that. That was a promise. It was locked in before the last election which the government won through deceit. Since that election the government has backtracked on that promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the government has not delivered those tax cuts affects many people in our community&mdash;particularly people in my electorate who are part-pensioners and self-funded retirees. I ask the question: what is the government doing for those people? Self-funded retirees and part-pensioners are going to lose because they are not receiving their tax cuts. There is no compensation in the budget for this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not rubbish; it is a fact. The point is that they would have received tax cuts. They were looking forward to receiving tax cuts. We will be told that that decision is somehow a win-win situation. The budget shows savings of the order of $200 million in respect of that particular item. Many people are going to lose money as a result of that. I am alluding to the government's decision about out deeming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On numerous occasions in this parliament I have raised the question of income testing of unrealised capital gains. We are delighted to see that go. But the government has replaced it with a deeming provision. When it settles down and the fine print is read, people will realise that they are going to lose some of their pensions. The government is saving money. Where are the savings coming from if they are not going to come from people who are now receiving part-pensions and who are going to lose those part-pensions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be some gains, there may be some winners on that, but there will be losers.

They will not be able to risk losing their part-pensions because they are not achieving five or seven per cent yields. If we look at all the bluechip investments in Australia we will find very few of them are yielding anywhere in the order of five or seven per cent, depending upon where the actual cut-off point is.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of points that have been raised in this debate and in the limited time I have I would certainly like to answer them. I will answer them in total if I can. A point I must make at the very beginning of my reply is that what has affected the opposition is not only the quality of this budget that has just been brought down but also the absolutely overwhelming response we have had from pensioners and pensioner groups, from carers, from single parents, from mothers across Australia. The kudos that has come and the response that we have got from the community in general have been tremendous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) mentioned a report that was done by Gregory and Hunter. That particular firm took census figures for 1976, 1981, 1986 and 1991, and went on to suggest the very substantial widening of income differences. But he did not go on with the evidence showing, for example, that the average household is being affected by female participation in the labour force, how it is rising in that particular area, how the income of the poorest group has risen. That has certainly not been recorded in his figures, nor have Gregory and Hunter chosen to take that up in some of their statistics. What the honourable member must do in future is read all of the facts, and then he will get a true interpretation of what we are talking about in social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that are affecting the opposition is this wonderful report that was certainly not put out by us but by an independent journalist, Deborah Hope, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 3 June. Perhaps I should give the honourable member a copy of it and ask him to read it. It discusses how the word `underclass' is being thrown around by assorted critics of Australia's social state. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's effective in debate&mdash;it has a credible, alarming and unacceptable ring about it. There is only one problem&mdash;it describes a group that doesn't really exist.</PARA>
<PARA>She then went on with a great degree of independent assessment of what is recognised now as one of the greatest social security systems in the world&mdash;an independent journalist, an independent assessment of it. Again, that has not come up in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for deeming, I would expect that the opposition would come around and admit that what has been put into place now with deeming for our pensioner groups is one of the fairest ways of assessing income and taking into account retirees, both pensioners and part-pensioners, who have their income invested. It also has to be acknowledged that what we have put into place is not something that occurred last week, or will occur next week; it comes into effect in July 1996. We have given those people an opportunity to look at the whole structure of their finances and where they can go. It is not something that is going to be brought in retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very pleasing to note that both financial institutions and pensioner groups who have been affected at times in the past by deeming have congratulated our minister and the government at large, saying, `We thank you for listening. We thank you for bringing down a very fair response as far as the deeming legislation is concerned.' And that is what it is all about. We need to continually assess the changes in the environment at large that we have to deal with in social security, but most particularly, as I say time and time again in the House, we need to make sure that legislation is not set in concrete, that we are able to amend legislation to meet the concerns of the people affected and are able to make sure that there is a fair distribution of the tax dollar to those people who are in need. That is the difference between those opposite and us. We look at the people in need and we assess the criteria in social welfare and social security which should make for adequate payments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As for the tax cuts, I do not hear the honourable member or any other opposition members getting up and acknowledging the first lot of tax cuts that were put into place on wages up to $50,000 and also in the lower tax scales. We do not hear explanations coming forward on that or what has happened since then and how people have been able to benefit from it. But one of the things we have got to realistically take on board is the fact that a lot of those people will in the terms of their natural lives probably receive, in social security payments or in other payments afforded to them under the social security structure, a lot more than they would ever have sacrificed in the tax cut that they did not receive in the last year or two of their working lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people who go on part pension or those people who have independent incomes that are supplemented by another payment under Social Security will certainly benefit from the structures that we have put into place. Whether it is in the deeming structure, whether it is what we have been able to do in bringing them onto health care cards, all of their benefits have to be acknowledged. In social security, you do not take one single issue and say, `This is where they are being deprived.' You take it in total and you look at the whole structure of what we are on about in the implementation of social security in general. What we are talking about here is a very fair budget. It is a budget that particularly in the Social Security area has been just and is certainly distributing to a lot of people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the context of these appropriations, I want to raise the failure of the government, with all of the money that is being appropriated, to be able to respond to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, as it then was, on conditional migrant entry. That report was in December 1992. It contained a large number of recommendations. The reason I raise this matter now is that I become quite despondent when I have large numbers of people approaching me, both in my electorate and also more broadly as a member of the present migration committee of the parliament, asking some fairly basic questions about how they can access Australia when a health problem presents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that committee report, there were a number of positive recommendations that provided for an up-front payment that might allow people who had been determined as having a potential cost to Australia to be able to access Australia. It also provided some greater element of discretion to the minister in looking at particularly difficult cases. One of the points I would like to make is that it becomes very apparent that, time and time again, there are people for whom there is a substantial economic benefit to Australia if they are able to migrate here but who, because of a health problem of a particular family member, find it difficult to access Australia. This was the problem that was identified by the parliamentary committee 3 1/2 years ago, which it sought to have redressed, and to which the government has failed to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other aspects of this question that also relate to other issues of a health nature. One of them relates to the question of the extent to which state authorities are notified of the presence within a state of people who are diagnosed as suffering tuberculosis or hepatitis B, when they come into Australia, to enable the appropriate public health strategies to be implemented. One would have thought that that was a pressing matter of very considerably urgency. In public hearings, before a committee of parliament, the issue was raised of tuberculosis and the way in which people have presented with some indication that this disease might still be with them or could potentially recur in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet we still have very significant problems in terms of notification to state authorities and, similarly, with the recommendations dealing with hepatitis B. I note also that there was considerable concern about the extent to which people who were non-permanent residents&mdash;that is, temporary residents&mdash;might be able to access Australia and, in particular, access Medicare and obtain services in Australia as a result of being temporarily here. Some recommendations were made on those issues and the government has not seen fit to respond to them either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a deplorable situation. I would hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) might be in a position to give us some program as to how the government intends to deal with the matter. It may well be that it will be a new government that needs to address these issues. We should consider that it has taken some 3 1/2 years, when the standard practice for replying to reports of parliamentary committees is that they should be responded to within three months. It has not occurred in this instance, and it is an outrageous situation. </PARA>

I thought that perhaps the wrong date was on this. After all, we are talking about the financial years 1995-96. Previously, in another debate, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) threw the paper on the desk with great flair, stating that he never got a chance to speak on anything dealing with the appropriations.</PARA></TALK.START>

I put it to him: how many reports has that Standing Committee on Migration brought down since 1992? How many reports were brought down and legislated upon, time and time again? This was because the government was listening and was taking on board the recommendations that were made by that committee. Those recommendations have gone through two different ministers. What has come forward, as the member for Berowra well knows, we have taken on board, time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Berowra had five minutes in which to express himself, if he was concerned about any detail of the appropriations. If he has to go back three years to a 1992 report, let it go on the record that the honourable member for Berowra time and time again leads for the opposition in the main chamber in debate on immigration. Never before in the bills that we have had&mdash;and we have numerous bills before our House, and numerous debates on immigration&mdash;has he come forward with this particular 1992 report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and time again, all the input we have from the honourable member for Berowra is a written report, from which he wants to quote verbatim. In this case, where we should be discussing allocation of funding, I can only assume by his silence that he is quite pleased and proud about what our government has been able to do in the Immigration estimates. I must congratulate our minister. As the honourable member for Berowra never had a thing to criticise on those estimates, we can only assume on this side of the House that when there is no criticism forthcoming he is actually congratulating the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will give me great delight to tell the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) that the opposition in the House of Representatives certainly supports the budget so far as immigration is concerned. There is not one criticism; not one comment been made on the allocation of financing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that standing committee was set up, the government has continued to evolve legislation to meet the concerns expressed in the reports, Some things we agree with, others we disagree with, but at all times the government offers full explanations for its responses.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For daring to stand up in this committee chamber and talk about a 1992 report, the member for Berowra ought to hang his head with shame. I do not believe that there are any people on the opposition benches who are saying to their whips that they need more time to debate the budget. I never realised that the honourable member for Berowra lives so much in the past. Three years is a bit over the top. I do not mind three months ago, I do not mind six months ago, even matters in the term of this parliament&mdash;but not three years ago, into the time of a previous parliament. The member for Berowra stands here, in a 1995-96 estimates debate, and talks about a 1992 report. He asks what is the government going to do in respect of the health requirements of those particular people who may not be permanent residents in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not ridiculous; this has gone to the extreme. This is absolutely ridiculous. Why cannot we debate the credible funding of the immigration portfolio through this committee so that it can go and be judged on that? Why do we not have a debate on that? Why do we not have an input on that? The only reason we do not have a debate on it and we do not have input from the opposition on it is that the opposition is saying, `Congratulations, government, well done. Congratulations, government, you have done the estimates well. Congratulations, government, you are caring for immigration.' And, most particularly, it is saying, `Congratulations, government, you know what you are on about; you know what you are doing.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the brief time available to me I would like to get back to some of the comments that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made in relation to transport in question time today. Notwithstanding the censure motion was on one particular issue, I would like to take issue with some of the misleading comments that the Prime Minister made then in relation to transport. He was talking about the final link in the standard gauge between Melbourne and Adelaide. While we are all pleased to see that occur, he then went on to talk about the fact that they can now bring double-stacked wagons through, including through to Melbourne. He mentioned Melbourne. I heard that distinctly.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought, `Wow,' and there we are. They cannot bring double stacked into Melbourne because, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) knows, they cannot get them through the Adelaide Hills. The Prime Minister went on again to talk about the lack of coalition contribution to the standard gauge development. Of course, he very conveniently overlooked the fact that it was the coalition that converted the Alice Springs to Adelaide line, the coalition that converted the Broken Hill to Port Pirie line. It was a coalition some years ago that actually converted the Sydney to Melbourne line to standard gauge. If we look at some of the developments during the previous coalition governments until the last four or five years, it was the coalition government that had a much better record when it came to capital expenditure on railways than the Hawke government. The Hawke government virtually starved Australian National of capital and it had to go heavily into debt to try to do some of its equipment replacement. I think that is something that was very much overlooked by the Prime Minister. It shows that when it comes to rail he likes to fudge the facts just as he likes to do on a number of other issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We looked at another area of transport that he was trying to admonish the opposition about&mdash;fuel tax. Yet it is the Labor government that has increased fuel tax almost exponentially. It was the Labor government that increased it after the 1992 election. It is the Labor government that is going to increase fuel tax again in July this year. So that is very much part of this budget debate. At the same time, it is the Labor government that has been progressively reducing the Commonwealth contribution to road funding. So if we look at the facts: from 1983-84 when over 60 per cent of fuel tax went into Commonwealth road funding, we find that today it is less than 10 per cent. At the same time, the Commonwealth's contribution to road funding in real terms has almost halved. In fact, it is under $800 million for the coming financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we can look at some of the other areas where this Labor government has failed in providing a world class transport system. That ought to be one of the fundamental things. If we are going to get this country really going, we ought to be looking at what we can do. We look in the area of regulation of road transport. Despite report after report, despite all the promises, we still have not got uniform road regulations right across this country. This government and the Commonwealth itself, as we know, have failed to bring in the latest bit of legislation that is supposed to be doing something about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look at a number of other areas, remembering that time is limited. I talked about fuel tax and road expenditure. We can look at the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure and the report that was brought down by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). He was a former transport minister in the Labor government. As he pointed out, nearly one in five dollars being spent on infrastructure in road building is probably being wasted; as he pointed out also, we could spend almost $1 billion more on road construction and not have to find another dollar. He was talking about the total expenditure nationally of $5 billion. The point that he was making, and I am glad to see the parliamentary secretary nodding his head, was that this should be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been in government for 12 years, however, what has the government done about it? The government has had 12 years. This report came out only just over a year ago and shows that the government has really been a failure. There is a very limited amount of time here and I just wanted to highlight these points to show that in some areas in transport the government's record is a very sad one. It has failed to provide a world-class transport system. What we have seen in so many areas is a government of perpetual announcement, where it announces and reannounces how it is going to do things but somehow they just never quite seem to get done. Unfortunately, all Australians, particularly those living in regional and rural Australia, are suffering because the government has failed to grasp the nettle on this whole transport issue and has failed to provide a world-class transport system. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, we had the standard gauge event yesterday. What a wonderful achievement for Australian Rail&mdash;a wonderful achievement, a great symbol for the nation, as the honourable member concedes. The opposition had 30 years to do it. The opposition had 23 years to do it between 1949 and 1972 and another seven years between 1975 and 1982&mdash;that is 30 years to do it. The opposition had five state Liberal governments to do it with, and still could not manage it. Gough Whitlam actually offered to buy the railways from the Liberal state governments and he could not even pay for them; so in the end we have got them to hand the railways over. We have been able to do it; we have injected this $400 million; and now, as the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) announced on Saturday night in his speech in Melbourne, there is a further proposal for Track Australia, which will become the authority to run the track around the nation, and, providing the government can get the structure in place for the next stage of reform, a further investment of another $500 million in rail in Australia, which is unprecedented in rail in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the fuel tax problem, I think the opposition actually believes what it goes around saying&mdash;firstly, that the federal government allocates only $800 million for road funds, and that only 3c or 4c of the fuel tax goes into roads. What the opposition conveniently forgets to mention every time we discuss this is that the federal government hands to states and to local government an amount in excess of $2 billion of untied funds which is spent on roads. Not only do we do this, but state governments ask us to tell them that it is for the roads, because their various treasurers otherwise want to hop into it for other reasons. Who asked for this untied road funding formula? The state governments asked for it, and most of them were Liberal state governments asking for it. </PARA>

Yet, as the committee chaired by the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) showed, $5 billion a year is spent in Australia on roads. Where does it come from? State taxes. And when we break down those state taxes and the revenue, it is the untied grants that come from the federal government, in the majority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the opposition also never mention the $6 billion worth of costs associated with road safety&mdash;and I am talking about cleaning up the mess from all the road accidents. The Bureau of Transport Economics costs that at $6 billion a year. What pays for that? Who pays for the ambulances, the hospitals and all of that? It comes out of untied funds that the federal government hands over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They never ever think about the $2 billion worth of environmental costs associated with pollution and all the other issues that we are funding in one way or another. Who do they think pays for it? The petrol tax argument is a dud. They do not do themselves any grace. Even the Road Transport Forum has given it away. Even the automobile associations have given it away. Show me when they last ran the petrol tax argument. They have given it away; they know it is a junk argument. The honourable member for Wannon is the last person in Australia running this argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could not believe he raised the uniform charges and regulations issue, because what did we do? We set up the National Road Transport Commission, with the cooperation of the state governments, and we set about the process of putting in place uniform legislation. The federal government, with the cooperation of the opposition, has passed every bit of legislation through the parliament the minute it has hit the deck. Who is holding it up? Poor old Eric Charlton, Western Australian Liberal Minister for Transport. He is the one who will not sign up. Bruce Baird was holding us up. Michael Knight and Brian Langton, the new ministers in the new government in New South Wales, said, `Yes, we are there. We will sign up straightaway, as soon as Western Australia does.' Who is holding us all up? A Western Australian state Liberal. How could the honourable member fall for that? How could he come in here and set his own party's state transport minister up like that? These are a few quick points and I think the government has a solid process in place. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is opportune that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) is here, although he is on his way out. I just came in on the tail end of his apology for the absolute damage that the Maritime Union has wreaked in Western Australia, when one considers that, as a result of what they have done, Stateships is now being closed. I think that as the parliamentary secretary, presumably somebody who is attuned to a rational solution to the problems on the waterfront, he would have been immensely shocked by that particular decision. I would have thought he would have been spending his time going and talking to the representatives of the MUA and endeavouring to arrive at some rational solution to the impasse at the Fremantle waterfront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I have come to make a contribution to this particular debate is that, a week or so ago, I happened to be at a function in my electorate&mdash;in fact, it was a play at one of the local high schools&mdash;and the fellow who was sitting next to me happened to be the operator of a business that used imported hard timber as part of his furniture manufacturing operations. His is a very small operation, essentially operating and providing supplies and equipment for craftsmen&mdash;people who are furniture makers or woodworkers at home. This chap, in a small way, had a $25,000 consignment of timber that was in a container ship that was heading towards the Fremantle wharves at that time. Because of the dispute, it headed off out into the ocean again. As he said to me, he did not know where it was at the particular stage I was talking to him. But here in a physical sense is a direct result of this type of industrial disputation. This is someone who employed, I think, two people&mdash;not a great deal&mdash;whose very business, his livelihood, was being threatened by the actions on the waterfront of the militant MUA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian government has been pilloried to a certain extent by those who have seen it as their role to do so. For what? For trying to introduce some basic reforms to bring down the costs of the operation of the waterfront at Fremantle. These are costs that are crippling businesses in Western Australia, that make Fremantle a less attractive port of call or place where cargo is transhipped, a place where there are inordinate delays, and an obvious place for the sorts of reforms that have been cried out for for a long time indeed. Many of the people who are going to be affected in the short to medium term by this disputation are ordinary small businesses being operated by average Australians who obviously employ a large number of other Australians because, as we do know, small business is one of the principal employer groups within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, we have a situation where, in order to effect a relatively simple reform&mdash;that is, to try to bring down the costs of stevedoring at Fremantle&mdash;we are going to see a situation where Stateships is closed down. I might add that, in the first instance, the state government was urged to close Stateships some time ago. It was kept operating, but it was running at a loss&mdash;a huge loss. That loss is passed on to every single consumer, not only in Western Australia but elsewhere because, in the end, it does not matter how you factor the cost of increased costs or losses. They inevitably go to the consumer, the ordinary Australian&mdash;in our case, the ordinary Western Australian&mdash;who has to pay more for the items that are transhipped via the Fremantle wharf or that travel on Stateships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the concluding moments of my speech, all I can do is urge the federal Labor government to use its good office to try to get the MUA to cooperate with what are quite simple, rational and commonsense reforms. Those reforms will ensure that Western Australians, and other Australian consumers, are able to enjoy the services of stevedoring and, of course, of Stateships transport at a lower cost&mdash;a lower net loss&mdash;to them. </PARA>

I do not think that has anything to do with the appropriations. It highlights again the opposition's industrial relations policy which, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made clear today, is still the bad old days.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time I have available I only wish to raise one subject, and that is the question of where, in this appropriation, is the encouragement for hardwood plantations and the like? I noticed the other day that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) was in the south-east of South Australia and he was quite flattering&mdash;as he should be&mdash;in describing that area as a model for softwood plantations. After 70 or 80 years and 230,000 acres of plantations, that seems to me a slight underdescription. Nevertheless, he said that there was a tremendous amount that could be achieved in the south-east of South Australia with plantation forestry and value-adding. Well, I agree; so much so that a couple of weeks before he was there we had a meeting in Mount Gambier of 100 growers looking at how we could increase hardwood plantations in the south-east of South Australia with a view to exporting more woodchips.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said that he believed that the tree farms or softwood plantations should be encouraged. Where are they being encouraged in this appropriation? I cannot find it. He said that this is bringing great benefits to the rest of Australia in terms of export markets. That is so obvious that it did not need saying. He said that that is something to be encouraged and which the Commonwealth strongly supports. How is that encouraged in this appropriation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister also said that he anticipated a relative reduction in the harvesting of old growth hardwood forests as plantations increased. The problem with that is that, if we are talking about chips, then I can understand what he is saying. However, if we are talking about logs for construction purposes and so forth, which take from 40 to 80 and even up to 120 years to grow, how is the government going to encourage that production? I have seen nothing in this appropriation to show that the government is encouraging, as the minister says, the phase-out of logging and forestry operations in high conservation value areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has no problem with all those evaluations being made. The opposition has no problem with regional agreements based on that high conservation assessment. What the opposition does have a problem with is finding where the government is encouraging plantations for long-term logging purposes&mdash;that is, as a substitute to native forests&mdash;anywhere in this appropriation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What one would be looking for&mdash;if not in the appropriation itself, then in policy&mdash;would be some form of tax arrangement which gave encouragement to those people who might be considering an investment of 20 years, 30 years, 45 years, 80 years or whatever to produce a certain type of timber. However, I cannot find that. It seems that nobody in the government has thought about the fact that for the potential investor&mdash;who after all is investing not for himself or for his kids, but for his grandchildren and who already has private, cleared land in the right rainfall area&mdash;there is no encouragement to substitute the logs of the future for the native forests of today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I travelled to that area the other day with the chairman of one of those companies. He looked out the window of the plane and said, `Isn't it nice to know that that forest of ours is growing at two tonnes a minute.' He was referring to the 45,000-acre forest owned by his company. The plantation industry, properly planned and properly encouraged, presents an enormous investment opportunity for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of criticism of Western Australians in this place, but the Western Australians, through the Department of Conservation and Land Management, have initiated long-term international contracts with the Japanese and the Koreans. The overseas interests are now at the stage where their 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 hectares have just about seen them out for big contracts, and so the Japanese, the Koreans, the Americans, and the Germans are looking for other places to plant. We should be looking at those sorts of contracts, not only for chip production for other people, but also for logging production. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to listen to the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). Obviously, he has not taken the time to study the budget document and the intentions of the government, otherwise he would have realised that there is an allocation of $53 million in this budget for a forest policy statement that will be announced later this month. I have no doubt that that policy will be every bit as successful as the coastal policy, Living on the Coast, which was launched last week by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner). That policy is a breath of fresh air in Australia's environmental world. </PARA>

It is going to involve a number of other departments. It is going to involve the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. It is going to involve the national landcare process. It is going to involve DEET and jobskills and new work opportunities. Only yesterday I had a meeting with about 50 people representing about 20 environmental groups in my electorate of Paterson.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This being the consideration in detail of the appropriations for the Attorney-General's Department, and given that there is five minutes for either side, one cannot deal with much detail in that time. I wish to concentrate my remarks on one aspect of the appropriation for the Attorney-General's Department: namely some of the programs provided through the Office of Legal Aid and Family Services. I do that in the context that there is something in our human nature that makes us want to connect with, to nurture, and to care for one another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to be a basic human instinct to care for and be cared for by others, to reach out to those about us and to create relationships in which we find meaning and identity in an often alienating and confusing world. People find something joyful about their relationships in human terms and in the connections that they are able to make with others. Given this powerful human instinct, it saddens me that so much of the time that we spend in this parliament, and in making our laws, is spent on dealing with disconnection and with the breaking down of relationships rather than on something to help people to nurture and build their relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this context that I wish to say a few words and ask a couple of questions about the estimates for the family services programs. One reads in the Justice Statement that various amounts of money are being promised over a four-year period. There is a reference in there to $12.3 million to enable more marriage and relationship preparation courses and another reference to $4 million for the same thing. There is also reference to $2.7 million for programs for non-English speakers and $2.8 million for family skills. When we look at the exact figures there seems to be double counting but, and this is one of the problems, we cannot find out the exact appropriations for these various programs for 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence to the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues a week ago, the Acting First Assistant Secretary to the department, Dr Margaret Browne, said that the additional appropriation for marriage education in 1995-96 would be $66,000; adolescent mediation would be $36,000; family skills would be $360,000; and, counselling, nothing. However, in evidence before the Senate estimates committee, the same Dr Browne said that, in relation to marriage education, the additional expenditure would be $707,000, and she repeated that figure to the committee four times. In relation to adolescent mediation, the figure she gave was not $36,000 but the additional figure of $393,000. For family skills, she said that the additional figure is not the one quoted earlier of $360,000 but the additional figure of $393,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to add some more confusion to the picture, I got a letter from Dr Browne today in relation to each of those programs. She says in there that the additional funding for marriage education is $665,000, that for family skills it is $360,000 and that for the adolescent mediation program it is $360,000. I now have three different sets of figures. The only consistency in them is that the figure for the increase in marriage counselling on all three occasions was given as nothing. I have written to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) asking him to clarify what seems, on the face of the evidence given, and in that letter to me, a confusing situation as to what the funding is for these programs. I do not think that that should be too much to ask. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the third or fourth year that there has not been any real increase in funding for marriage counselling and that is clear on all of the answers. In evidence to the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, we heard from the Director of Counselling Services at Relationships Australia in Adelaide that there are delays in that agency of three to four weeks&mdash;other agencies talk of delays of six to eight weeks&mdash;yet we have no increase whatsoever in funding for marriage counselling. Finally, and I have made this point before, let us look at the balance between the building up of relationships, nurturing and supporting them and the consequences of marriage breakdowns. We give a few million dollars to the building of relationships, and this budget gives additional funding, which I support, and yet we spend about $3,000 million a year on the consequences of marriage breakdowns. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The following answer is provided on behalf of all Portfolio Ministers to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The national competition policy proposed by the Hilmer Committee largely establishes reform processes rather than specific reforms in individual sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to taxation, the national competition policy reforms establish a set of principles designed to achieve competitive neutrality between government and private businesses. These principles do not require the Commonwealth to impose taxes on Departmental businesses because they cannot be obliged to pay taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of Departmental liability for local government rates, section 114 of the Constitution precludes States from imposing any tax on property belonging to the Commonwealth, without the consent of the Commonwealth Parliament. However, Departments presently operate under Finance Directions which allow the gratuitous payment to local governments of an amount equivalent to general rates in circumstances where such costs will be demonstrably passed on to third parties. These circumstances might arise where, for example, a Commonwealth Department uses property for a commercial undertaking and includes the cost of rates in its pricing structure. It is not anticipated that implementation of the Hilmer Report will change this policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(a) and (b) Discussions with State and Territory Governments on implementation of the Hilmer Report have been in train since the Hilmer Report's release in August 1993. Draft legislation and inter-governmental agreements were released for public comment. Revised legislation was introduced to the Senate on 29 March 1995, and revised inter-governmental agreements were executed at the Council of Australian Governments meeting on 11 April 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hilmer Report has six main elements, which will have varying effects on the activities of Departments. Financial effects may include a possible slight lowering of the prices of goods and services purchased by Departments, arising from increased competition within the economy. Non-financial effects will include the work associated with the involvement of Departments in the implementation of reforms flowing from the proposed national competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first element of the Hilmer Report is legislation affecting the operation of the competition provisions contained in Part IV of the Trade Practices Act. The amendments involve extension of Part IV of that Act to currently exempt businesses. There are also some technical amendments to the form of the prohibitions. Commonwealth Departments are already bound by the Trade Practices Act, and it is not expected that the amendments to that Act will have a significant effect upon Departments' activities. There is likely to be some impact on State Government departments and authorities which are not currently bound by that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element of the Hilmer Report is a process for reform of regulation that unjustifiably restricts competition. Under the inter-governmental Competition Principles Agreement the Commonwealth is required to develop a process for the review of legislation that restricts competition, to ensure that the benefits of the restriction to the community as a whole outweigh the costs and that the objectives of the legislation can only be achieved by restricting competition. Various Departments will be involved in reviews of legislation, and as a result of the review processes some legislation administered by Departments is likely to be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third element of the Hilmer Report relates to the structural reform of public monopolies. The Competition Principles Agreement requires the Commonwealth to ensure that before introducing competition to a sector traditionally supplied by a public monopoly, it will remove from the public monopoly any responsibilities for industry regulation. The Commonwealth is also required, before introducing competition to a market traditionally supplied by a public monopoly, or before privatising a public monopoly, to undertake a review to ensure that various policy matters are duly taken into consideration. These requirements do not commit the Commonwealth to the introduction of competition in particular sectors or to the privatisation of particular commercial operations. Nevertheless, where Commonwealth Departments do propose to introduce competition to a sector traditionally supplied by a public monopoly, or to privatise a public monopoly, they will need to ensure compliance with the Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth element of the Hilmer Report is the establishment of a legal regime permitting, in certain circumstances, third parties to have access to certain facilities, such as electricity transmission grids or gas pipelines, which are essential for competition in related markets. The access regime will be established in a new Part of the Trade Practices Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth element of the Hilmer Report relates to prices surveillance. The legislation which was introduced into Parliament contains a number of amendments to the Prices Surveillance Act, including the introduction of ongoing formal monitoring of prices charged by businesses. The PSA is to be merged with the Trade Practices Commission to form a new competition authority. Commonwealth Departments are already potentially subject to scrutiny under the Prices Surveillance Act, although occasions on which Departments have actually been subjected to such scrutiny have been rare. It is not expected that the amendments to that Act will have any significant impact upon the activities of Commonwealth Departments. There is likely to be some impact on State Government Departments and authorities which are not currently subject to that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final element of the Hilmer Report relates to the competitive neutrality of Government businesses. The Competition Principles Agreement requires the Commonwealth to develop a policy statement on competitive neutrality, with the objective being that Government businesses should not enjoy any net competitive advantage simply as a result of their public sector ownership. The effects of implementation of this element of the Hilmer package will not be determined until the Commonwealth develops its policy statement on competitive neutrality. </PARA>

DEET does not monitor a specific participant's movements from one Skillshare service to another but rather records a single placement with Skillshare regardless of how many individual services may be accessed. Thus, it is not feasible to identify a "full approved placement period" and, therefore, the concept of an exit being early does not apply.</PARA>

In many cases the reason may be to commence full-time employment or to undertake further full-time education and training. Often clients who leave wage subsidy placements do so to transfer to an unsubsidised job. Outcomes which are achieved in this way are obviously more cost effective than those achieved through full completion of a subsidy period or course.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government has not increased the size of an individual's Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) debt in the 1995-96 Budget or introduced up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students. The Government has increased its commitment to the further development of a high quality and accessible Australian higher education system. The 1995-96 Budget provides $16.5 billion over the 1996-98 funding triennium for the higher education sector, including funding for additional student places in areas of growing population and growth in research and research infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995 the average funding rate per EFTSU in Western Australia is $9,995 (at the 1995-96 Budget price level).

The rate will increase in 1996 and 1997, with the average funding per EFTSU in 1997 reaching $10,070 (at 1995-96 Budget prices).</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government already provides financial assistance for disadvantaged students through the AUSTUDY scheme to assist them with the costs of their education. In addition, AUSTUDY recipients may apply for the AUSTUDY Supplement, an optional loan scheme which offers tertiary students the opportunity to increase the amount of money they can get while studying. In 1995, AUSTUDY will assist around half a million students at a cost of $1.5 billion. It is a matter for students how they spend their AUSTUDY allowance. The Government will not be introducing a separate rebate for the purchase of textbooks.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9T4">Mr Walker</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) In December 1992 Dasfleet entered into a leasing agreement with the Transport Workers Union in respect of 62 vehicles. There was no fixed term for the agreement, however the vehicles are leased on a one year/40,000km basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aspect of this agreement that rightly created public controversy was the fixing of a rent based on the assumption that the TWU held sales and fuel excise tax exempt status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December of 1993 following a Dasfleet review of its contracts the Australian Tax Office confirmed that with the possible exception of a small number of vehicles used pursuant to tax exempt community service schemes, unions were not exempt from sales or fuel tax. Certainly none of the 62 vehicles had such exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From January 1994 Dasfleet insisted that rentals be increased to a full tax inclusive rate. The monthly increase varied from $200 for a Magna to $260 for a Ford Fairmont.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be understood that Dasfleet as part of the Crown is not liable to pay sales tax or excise duty. It pays notional duty only to honour its commitment to maintain a level playing field with private sector competitors. In this context Dasfleet paid $234,683 into consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney General's Department advised Dasfleet that it could not maintain an action in debt against the TWU in respect of lost notional sales tax or excise duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legal principle here, simply put, is that it is not possible to sue for debts paid on somebody else's behalf if there is no legal obligation to make such a payment in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested in some quarters that the TWU should be paying penalty tax or interest. Those suggestions misunderstand the legal position. The TWU was never liable to pay the tax and penalties do not enter the picture. There being no debt, interest could not possibly accrue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we have is a situation where the rent fixed under agreement was insufficient because acting on the Union's representations Dasfleet failed to take tax into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was for these reasons that I asked Dasfleet to seek Senior Counsel's advice as to whether it might be possible to maintain an action against the TWU for damages for misleading or deceptive conduct under Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr. P. Donohoe QC duly advised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, if such an action was successful the damages would be limited to the value of the lost opportunity to enter into a contract incorporating higher tax rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, because the TWU had been paying the higher sales tax inclusive rates since January 1994 the amount of those damages would only relate to the lost opportunity in the year to December 1993 and would be less than the notional tax paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there were a number of complex legal reasons in respect of which Dasfleet's suit might fail. (The union's defence was that it had made an innocent mistake about its liability for sales and fuel tax and that Section 52 did not apply) and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, litigation was not the appropriate course and the issue should be resolved under the dispute resolution clause in the lease agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accepted Senior Counsel's advice and agreed to Dasfleet proceeding accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of the dispute resolution process was an agreement by the TWU to pay to Dasfleet $144,263.38 which represents full repayment of outstanding fuel excise and a proportion of the sales tax liability that in the opinion of Dasfleet's legal advisers could reasonably have been expected by way of damages for the year when no tax was included in the rent.</PARA>
