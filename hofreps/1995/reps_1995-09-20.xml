<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill 1995 will amend the fringe benefits tax and income tax laws to give effect to the government's fringe benefits tax cost of compliance statement of 24 February 1995. It will also make changes to the fringe benefits tax substantiation rules which were announced on 29 March 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with this government's desire to minimise taxpayers' costs in complying with the tax laws, the amendments in this bill will substantially reduce compliance costs for employers liable to fringe benefits tax. In addition, a number of benefits provided by employers will no longer be subject to fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the measures in this bill will apply from 1 April 1995, the start of the current fringe benefits tax year. However, measures dealing with living away from home allowances will take effect from 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Exempt items</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will exempt from fringe benefits tax a range of benefits that are primarily used for business purposes. These benefits include employment related protective clothing, briefcases, calculators and electronic diaries, tools of trade, employment related software and portable computers. Mobile and car phones will also be exempt where their use is primarily for employment purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognition of the safety and health issues involved, taxis provided by employers to employees for travel to and from home between the hours of 8.00 p.m. and 6.00 a.m. will be exempt, as will taxi travel for sick employees to home or to another place of care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exemption of taxi travel is estimated to cost $45 million in 1995-96 and $30 million in each later year. The other exemptions have a small but unquantifiable cost to revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Declarations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also reduce the number of declarations required by the fringe benefits tax law. Where a series of identical benefits is provided, an employee declaration is generally required each time a benefit is provided so that the private portion of the benefit can be determined. This requirement for multiple declarations will be replaced by a single employee declaration which can be used for up to five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, a single employer declaration will also be available in certain situations. This declaration can also be used for up to five years. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Entertainment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will reduce the compliance costs associated with the calculation of FBT on meal entertainment by providing two further options for determining the value of a benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simplest of these methods is to accept that 50 per cent of expenditure on meal entertainment in a year is subject to fringe benefits tax, with the balance being non-deductible to the employer. This method will also be available for use with the lease or hire costs of corporate boxes and other entertainment facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other method requires the employee to keep a 12-week register. This register is then applied over the whole year to determine the amount of meal entertainment which is subject to fringe benefits tax and the amount which is deductible for income tax purposes. The register will remain effective for up to five years. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Car parking</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments in the bill will also reduce the compliance costs associated with the taxation of car parking benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, fringe benefits tax will no longer apply to car parking on employers' premises unless there is a commercial car parking station within a one kilometre radius that charges more than $5 a day at the beginning of the fringe benefits tax year. This will ensure that fringe benefits tax will only apply to car parking in areas where such benefits have significant values, such as in CBD areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, employers will be able to adopt a simplified method of valuing car parking benefits. This new method will enable an employer to determine the value of a benefit by reference to the average of the lowest commercial car park fees at the start and end of the FBT year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, a further two optional methods for calculating the total taxable value of car parking fringe benefits will be available. One of these methods uses a statutory formula and the other allows an employer to keep a 12-week record of car park usage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comparable changes will be made to the income tax law relating to the deductibility of car parking expenditure incurred by self-employed taxpayers. These amendments are estimated to cost $76 million in 1995-96 and $62 million in each later year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will also take the opportunity in this bill to make a technical correction to ensure that, as originally intended, car parking benefits provided by Commonwealth, state or territory government educational institutions will be exempt from fringe benefits tax. This amendment, which will have no effect on revenue, will be retrospective to 1 April 1993. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Living away from home allowances</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also modify the fringe benefits tax treatment of living away from home allowance benefits and other food and accommodation benefits provided to employees who are required to live away from their usual place of residence. These modifications will provide a greater degree of certainty in determining whether the benefits will be subject to concessional treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These benefits will be subject to concessional treatment for up to four years for benefits provided to expatriates working in Australia or for benefits provided to Australian residents working overseas, for up to two years for employees working in remote areas&mdash;unlimited time for employees working on a `fly-in fly-out' basis&mdash;and for up to one year for benefits provided for all other employees. The date of effect of these measures has been moved to 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Substantiation rules</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also amend the fringe benefits tax substantiation provisions to make them generally consistent with the revised income tax substantiation rules, including reducing the period for which records are required to be retained from seven to five years. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Car statutory formula</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to maintain the revenue neutrality of this package of compliance cost reduction measures, the bill will increase the statutory fractions used in the statutory formula for car benefits by approximately 10 per cent. Even with these increases in the statutory fractions, the statutory formula will remain significantly concessional under a wide range of circumstances.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is estimated to raise $121 million in 1995-96 and $91 million in each later year. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Rebate for medical research bodies</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also extend the rebate of fringe benefits tax presently allowed to certain non-profit, non-government bodies to certain medical research bodies which, while established under a Commonwealth, state or territory law, are not conducted by or on behalf of a government. The amendment will be effective from 1 April 1994. Full details of the amendments in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also foreshadow that the government will be moving some minor amendments to the bill in the House. Copies of those amendments and a supplementary explanatory memorandum have been circulated to members. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act in order to implement the results of a review on FBT compliance costs. The results were announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in February of 1995. But there was a sting in the package. The sting in the package was an increase in the fringe benefits tax payable in respect of cars. From the outset the review was hamstrung by the fact that it was stipulated that the review had to be revenue neutral. That being the case, those reductions which were warranted on the grounds of reducing compliance costs could only be purchased at the price of paying additional tax, in this case additional tax falling in relation to motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conduct of the review itself will give some indication as to what priority this government gives to reforming the monster it has created in respect of compliance costs under the fringe benefits tax. The Treasurer initially anticipated that the review would be completed in July of 1994 but it was not until seven months later, in February of 1995, that it was reported. The bill was not produced until June of 1995, over a year after the review was announced and three months after the new rules were due to take effect in April. Even then the results were not final. The changes have been made to the package in the bill itself. It is now September, and the legislation to implement the changes&mdash;changes which were supposed to be commenced in April of this year&mdash;is only now coming on for debate in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, five months after the changes were due to take effect, we have got around to debating the legislation to achieve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's position on the review is indeed indicative of its position on the tax generally. It has no real interest in the burden of compliance costs that its fringe benefits tax nightmare has put on business and particularly small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we welcome some changes in the bill, it does not ameliorate the government's abysmal track record on the issue. The fringe benefits tax was introduced in 1986, some nine years ago, and since then its claws have stretched wider and wider&mdash;to car parking, to entertainment and, if Mr Dawkins had had his way, to business travel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With every change to the FBT rules, estimates of the revenue that it brings in balloon further and further. The estimate for 1995-96 is $2.8 billion. Each time the rules change, the legislation becomes more complex, the compliance costs rise, but from the government's point of view the revenue increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business is labouring under an unwieldy burden, an administrative nightmare. The Australian Tax Research Foundation report released in 1993 entitled, `The compliance costs of employment related taxation in Australia' estimated total compliance costs of the fringe benefits tax in 1989-90 at $128 million or 10.9 per cent of the tax revenue raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report by Geoff Pope entitled, `Policy implications arising from compliance costs of taxation', Curtin University, estimated compliance costs of the FBT in 1990-91 at $134 million or 10.6 per cent of FBT revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we extrapolate to today's figures compliance costs of 10.9 per cent of the estimated revenue, in 1995-96 the compliance costs would be around $300 million. That is just more than the amount that it was estimated the whole tax would have raised in its first year of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is more important is that the Pope analysis shows that FBT compliance costs hit small business very hard indeed. In 1990-91 compliance costs were 42.1 per cent of the FBT paid by these businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is small business that does not have the accountants and the lawyers, the shielding professions, that bears the brunt of the complex and complicated arrangements that the government has put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These studies do not even take into account the onerous compliance costs associated with car parking and entertainment benefits dragged into the FBT net subsequent to those studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers and their advisers have made it abundantly clear to the government that the rules are complex and the compliance costs severe, but the government has taken very little notice, blinded by the revenue gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it was in February of 1995 that the Treasurer announced the results of his review, claiming with his customary public relations verve:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures I am announcing today will dramatically reduce compliance costs for employers liable for FBT.</PARA>
<PARA>But `dramatically reduce' was, of course, a gross overestimation. The explanatory memorandum itself admits that certain measures will increase compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A survey of the top 100 companies revealed there would be minimal savings as a result. Even as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> reported in March of 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . employers will now have no less than three options on how to calculate FBT on employee entertainment costs. Take your pick, it will only take a week per year to calculate the most favourable method of ascertaining FBT on entertainment costs.</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer's message was clear&mdash;that as the price for such changes as he introduced, revenue would remain neutral by increasing the fringe benefits tax on cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results were not widely embraced by professional and business communities. Many saw the review for what it truly was. Bob Jeffery, the national president of the Australian Society of CPAs, said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the so-called review of FBT has turned out to be just a thinly veiled exercise to appease genuine business concerns while still slugging business to raise the same amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bob Bryant, the executive director of the Corporate Tax Association, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What he handed down in our view was not a serious attempt to come to grips with the inadequacies of the FBT regime. He has really let us down.</PARA>
<PARA>And indeed he did. Mr David Taylor, the chief executive of the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . no business, small or big, will benefit from this. All the Government has done is admit it has made hideous errors with FBT. Small business may have a few less forms to fill in, but the underlying problems with FBT and the difficulties caused are still there.</PARA>
<PARA>A <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new rules exempt a few trinkets from the tax net, but lift the rate on the big-ticket items. The result of this supposed generosity? A windfall for the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>Like business, the accounting professions and those who actually deal with the fringe benefits tax, the coalition is extremely dissatisfied with this outcome. After months of discussions and submissions, the government laboured so long for so little. What was most intriguing was that the estimates of loss of revenue from car parking and after-hours taxi travel changes matched, to the dollar, the estimated revenue gained from increasing the statutory fractions on cars where employers used the statutory formula. This is particularly interesting, given that it is so simple to estimate the gain in revenue from increasing the FBT on cars. How was it that they were so precise in estimating the loss of revenue in relation to changes on car parking and after-hours taxi travel?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, of course, a happy coincidence for the government that the estimates of revenue gains and losses are identical. It is a happy coincidence for the government, but of course an assessment not shared by independent valuations. A survey of the top 100 companies, for example, came to a very different conclusion. They said that the so-called improvements to the FBT, taking the package as a whole, would in fact cost their companies FBT in addition of $28.7 million annually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What business wants is lower compliance costs so that they do not spend all their time trying to work out what they have to pay to the Taxation Office. It is not so much what has to be paid but the additional cost of trying to work out how it actually has to be paid and how it has to be assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government imposed time involved which takes them away from their real business, which produces goods and services and jobs, that people are complaining about. It is about understanding the predicament that small business and business generally is in. The government shows a lack of understanding as to the difficulties of people who are not tax accountants and lawyers. It may be shopkeepers or service providers who are brought into this net and instructed, as a result of the complexity, that they may have to sit down on a Sunday afternoon and do this or take a week off management time and try to assess it. It is they who, at the end of the day, just feel that it is a burden and a drag on the business. In the end, of course, it is anti-employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers are complaining about the way in which the government shows little or no understanding of the predicament in which they find themselves. Even the Treasurer, when he was questioned about this in the parliament, said this in justification of the increase in the statutory formula in relation to cars:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those opposite think it is fine for there to be this kind of loophole for people in well-paid positions to be able to get these large fringe benefits in a way which is only very lightly taxed under the present arrangements . . . It pays for the other very worthwhile changes.</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer's justification for all of this was that his previous regime, the regime which is currently operating in  relation to cars, was what&mdash;a loophole? Has he been operating a loophole with lightly taxed statutory formula hitherto? In fact, does he really believe that he is justified in putting up the statutory formula to close that loophole? Of course he does not believe that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is poor justification to try to rip out extra revenue to offset losses in relation to changes which should never have been implemented in the first place. That is the reality. When the government took off measures which should never have been implemented in the first place, it took the opportunity to compensate itself with measures which were totally unwarranted. The Treasurer's justification in relation to this, like so many of his justifications, shows no real appreciation of the real world or of the impact on the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To him it is just a question of getting as much money as he can. There is no conception in his mind of harmonising a tax policy to economic policy generally; no conception in his mind that tax is an instrument of policy that must be harmonised to economic development, to job creation and to economic growth. For him it is essentially a business backed by the government to extract money in order to maximise profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This bill provides employers with two optional methods for determining their FBT liability on the cost of meal entertainment benefits to employees. The methods are a fifty-fifty split and a 12-week register. Many employers who adopt the fifty-fifty split method may pay more FBT than if they base their calculations on actual expenditure. Under the fifty-fifty method employers halve their total meal expenditure. Fifty per cent will be subject to FBT and the remainder will be non-deductible to the employer. This method totally ignores whether the expenditure would be deductible for income tax purposes, and the taxable value of meal entertainment expenditure cannot be reduced by employee contributions or under the `otherwise deductible' rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where an employer elects to use the 12-week register method, it is entitled to claim a deduction for meal entertainment equal to the amount of the expense multiplied by the register percentage. The register percentage is the ratio of total value of meal entertainment fringe benefit to total value of meal entertainment expenses. The employer must keep the register for 12 continuous weeks. The period must be representative of meal entertainment patterns over the year. For most employers, especially small businesses, the Christmas period would not be representative and, in any event, a new register must be kept every five years unless total meal expenditure is more than 20 per cent higher than in the year the register was first kept&mdash;bear in mind that this is simplification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill clarifies that corporate boxes are not `business premises' of the employer, with the result that food and drink consumed by employees and their associates on those premises will be subject to FBT. It also enables employers to apply the fifty-fifty method to the leasing and hiring of corporate boxes and other similar hospitality arrangements to determine what amount will be subject to FBT. The fifty-fifty option, while very simple, only applies to meal entertainment and not to recreation so that, as a consequence, where you have a Christmas party followed by a cruise you have got to separate meal and recreation costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also aims to introduce some certainty in relation to living away from home allowances. An allowance will only be a living away from home allowance fringe benefit where the total period for which the employee has lived, or is required to live, away from his or her home is less than 12 months where Australian residents are posted within Australia or two years if the employee is posted to a remote location. The maximum residence period for employees working in Australia on temporary work permits and Australian residents posted overseas is four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The changes increase compliance costs by requiring declarations by both the employer and the employee in order for an allowance to qualify as a living away from home allowance fringe benefit. For the first time employers will be required to provide declarations which will duplicate employee declarations. A further problem is that, before the taxable value can be reduced for accommodation, the amounts actually spent on accommodation need to be substantiated. This will also increase compliance costs for employers and may be difficult, if not impossible, where the allowance is paid pursuant to awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill changes the benefits which accrue or apply in relation to fly-in fly-out where the employee's usual place of employment is an oil rig or another remote location and the employee returns to his usual place of residence on scheduled days off. The new rules introduce more certainty about when an employee is considered to be living away from home, but they do impose arbitrary time frames which may not be suited to arrangements in particular industries, such as the construction industry, or for arrangements of particular employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 12-month/four-year time frame creates numerous inequalities. The Corporate Tax Association has argued that there is no justification for different treatment of employees required to move within Australia to employees transferred overseas. One adverse effect is that employers who elect to transfer foreign residents rather than Australian residents will be penalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the bill is the treatment in relation to car parking. FBT will no longer apply to car parking benefits unless a commercial station within a one-kilometre radius of employer-provided car parking facilities charges at least $5 per day on the first day of the FBT year. Whilst FBT will now generally be payable only on car parking benefits in CBD areas as a result of this change, it does discriminate between employers in CBDs and those in outlying suburbs and regional centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The insertion of a $5 threshold without indexation may result in the exemption for car parking in regional centres being short lived. The coalition will be supporting this measure but will be moving an amendment to index the $5 figure in line with CPI rises. In other words, you should not lose the benefit of the $5 by reason of the creep of inflation. I urge the government to accept that amendment. There is no reason why it would not do so, except a rapacious revenue appetite. All that will do is preserve that $5 threshold in terms of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill gives employers an extra optional way to value car parking benefits. Under the average lowest cost method, the taxable value is to be determined by calculating the average of the lowest fees charged by any operator of a commercial car parking station within a one-kilometre radius on the first and last days of the FBT year. The value is reduced by the recipient's contribution towards the benefit. The average cost method is simple and will reduce compliance costs for employers. However, it makes FBT planning and remuneration planning difficult since the average lowest cost cannot be determined until the end of the FBT year. You have to wait for the last day before you have a clear idea of the average cost, which makes planning difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers are also given two extra ways to calculate the total taxable value of car parking benefits provided in a year. Under the first of these&mdash;the statutory formula method&mdash;the taxable value for each space is calculated by multiplying the statutory number of days, 240, by the daily rate amount. Unfortunately, in setting the statutory number of days at 240, the government has ignored public holidays, rostered days off, long service leave and days that employees may be away on business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will be moving an amendment to reduce the statutory number to 228 to take into account 12 national public holidays. Again, I urge the government to accept using the statutory formula method. In using the number of working days to get the benefit we should take into account the number of days that are likely to be worked, excluding public holidays. I urge the government to take that into account and to accept the coalition's amendment. Alternatively, there is another method where a 12-week register is kept for a representative period. The new register must be kept every five years or where the number of car parking spaces increases by more than 10 per cent in a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The car parking measures in the bill may reduce compliance costs associated with car parking, but that is because the car parking application of fringe benefits tax has been ludicrous. It is also important that the $5 threshold be representative. It is also important, as I have said before, that that be indexed for inflation. The 12-week register method is less onerous than keeping records for the full year. But, as the Taxation Institute of Australia says, the 12-week register imposes another onerous obligation. It argues that the matters to be included in the register are too onerous. Employers still need to undertake a new register when the number of spaces increases by more than 10 per cent in a year. It cannot be kept over a Christmas period, which might not be representative with staff on holidays, and again it will lead to difficult account keeping requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bear in mind that all of these account keeping requirements are necessary so you can work out how much tax you have to pay the government for providing a benefit to an employee. The fringe benefits tax is all about how much tax an employer should pay to the government for the privilege of providing a benefit to an employee. That is what it is about. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The items now being exempted should never have been subject to FBT in the first place. Little or no tax is being collected on these items, and often the compliance costs were greater than the FBT collected. As a result of the changes, employers who provide only minor fringe benefits will no longer be concerned with FBT in respect of these items, which is a positive result. Greed appears to have been the only fathomable excuse for the application of FBT on these items in the first place. The number of declarations that employees must submit to employers will also be reduced by the exempt status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill changes the arrangements in relation to taxi travel provided to employees for travel directly between work and home between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. and taxi travel provided for sick or injured employees to travel from work to their usual place of residence. The exemption extends to taxi travel between work and home via a doctor's surgery or other place of treatment. It also extends to travel from work to a place where the employee can get care&mdash;for example, a relative's home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some sense in these amendments because employers will no longer be required to keep records to determine the taxable value for FBT purposes of taxi travel between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m.&mdash;that is, keep a record of when people actually travel by taxi in order to work out how much tax they must remit to the government for providing the taxi fare. But you do not have to keep the records, this government says out of the generosity of its heart, for the time between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. because it may not be that much of a benefit to travel in a taxi at that time. We will be moving an amendment to modify the hours of the exemption to be from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. to take account of the commercial realities. We urge you to take that into account when the debate comes on in the detailed stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimated cost to revenue of this measure is $45 million in 1995-96 and $30 million in each later year. Obviously many employees are given taxi travel for safety reasons. They might be asked to work back and it is unsafe for them to get on the train. But if they are kept back, given a taxi voucher and they leave before 8 p.m., this government says you have to pay a tax on the value of the taxi travel because it is such a lucrative benefit to the employee. This is how ridiculous the government's tax treatment has got. The bill also provides for recurring fringe benefits declarations, which I will not go into.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tried by interjection to get some clarification, when he was complaining about businesses paying this tax on behalf of employees, about whether it was opposition policy that the tax should be transferred to the employees and they should pay it. I am sure the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record will show that I was unable to elicit a response that would enable me to conclude that that position was false. So it is a clear warning&mdash;not overtly stated but covertly stated&mdash;that opposition policy is that they are dissatisfied with the FBT. They are concerned about the imposts on business. Their approach will be to transfer this from employers who currently pay it to employees. That is sad news for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can have no intelligent discussion about FBT unless we understand the history of it. Indeed, the shadow Treasurer was gleefully pointing out that there was an occasion when FBT was not paid. That is true. It is the Labor government, of course, which has introduced it. Let me explain why. The reason is very simple. If you are an ordinary Australian, man or woman, maybe a young person, and you have got a job, you pay full tax on your earnings. Your employer deducts it and it goes straight to the taxation department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many members in this House will recall that, under the previous regime of John Howard&mdash;then Treasurer, now Leader of the Opposition and the alternative Prime Minister&mdash;it was possible to claim things like entertainment. It was well known that the senior executives, not the workers, would go out and entertain their clients. Not only did they entertain their clients but they also entertained their families. Sometimes they did not even bother to have clients at those lunches and dinners. It was a haemorrhage on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not ideological about this. If this had been an even-handed approach where big managers and high-powered executives were able to enjoy these benefits, and ordinary workers were also able to enjoy them, maybe that would have been fair enough. But that was not the case; it was all one-sided. In fact, we saw more and more executive salaries being put into non-cash benefits and less into cash benefits, so there were things like cars, houses, entertainment and school fees. All of these were non-cash benefits being paid for by the employer&mdash;no tax was paid by the employer for it and no tax was paid by the employee, the hot-shot executive, for it. But old muggins, Mr and Mrs Average, Mr and Mrs Ordinary Worker, were paying every last cent of tax on the money they were earning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We never hear an apology from those opposite about this being a rort and an outrage and that it was haemorrhaging the tax system. There has been not one apology from those opposite. But, here in this House, and indeed in the Senate, they will get up and lecture us, as the shadow Treasurer did. He did not say too much about what opposition policies were and he did not say what direction they will take or what major changes they will make, but he did lecture us. Those opposite say things like, `It is the compliance cost', and there is a compliance cost. They say, `This is onerous on small business', and it is onerous on small business. But can anyone tell me of a taxation system that is not complex or onerous? What humbug that is coming from the shadow Treasurer&mdash;a skilled lawyer, like all those hired guns, the lawyers and accountants, who do nothing more than pore over tax law to find a loophole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, was Treasurer, it was an utter disgrace. We had all sorts of schemes being dreamed up by the shadow Treasurer's colleagues in the legal and accounting professions. We had bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, cherry-picking schemes, you name it. It was seen as legitimate to pay little or no tax but, as I say, ordinary workers, ordinary Australians, young apprentices and people going into their first jobs were paying their full measure. There were no opportunities for them to shirk or avoid it. So it is absolute humbug on the part of the shadow Treasurer when he walks in here and says, `Look, there is a compliance cost; we are concerned about the compliance cost'. Of course we too on this side are concerned about the compliance cost, but we want integrity, equity and fairness in the taxation system. Did anyone hear any of those words used by the shadow Treasurer? He would not know what they meant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Treasurer said that the Treasurer, Mr Willis&mdash;who is, some say, probably technically one of the best Treasurers this country has ever seen, bearing in mind I am the member for Chifley, and Chifley was not too bad&mdash;does not have an understanding of the ability of the tax system to harmonise and promote growth. This came from the spokesman for the Leader of the Opposition. For so many wealthy in the community, paying tax was a theoretical construct when we had the highest marginal rate of taxation&mdash;60 per cent taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those days, we did not have our system of dividend imputation&mdash;said by many to be one of the best regimes of dividend imputation in the world.

We did not have it. </PARA>

I am talking about my battlers in the electorate of Chifley&mdash;they are the true-blue variety; they are good people. They did not have an opportunity to benefit from capital gains tax, but that was okay by the Leader of the Opposition and apparently okay by the shadow Treasurer. They talk about this need to harmonise the tax system to encourage employment growth. With great respect, I need to point out that in this Labor government's term of office, since the 1993 election, the economy has actually grown by some 600,000 jobs. </PARA>

They would love to stand up in their national assemblies or their various parliaments and say, `Look, on a per capita basis, we are doing as well as Australia and Australia has 600,000 employment growth.' They would love it. They dream about it. They have all sorts of task forces and are developing new policies to try to emulate our performance. </PARA>

Another comment that he made&mdash;and I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I seem to take so much umbrage at the shadow Treasurer, but I am sure many people listening to him would be sadly disappointed&mdash;was that this government has a rapacious revenue appetite. He says it as though we are some sort of three-headed monster that has got Australia to record levels of revenue and somehow the taxation burden in Australia is extraordinarily high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not have to take my word for it.

The member for Chifley is only concerned with northern Australia. The coalition and I have far wider concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill 1995 was introduced into the House on 28 June. This bill is important because it is supposed to reduce the burdensome costs of complying with the fringe benefits tax. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would recall that the government announced a review of the compliance costs of the fringe benefits tax in last year's budget. In so doing, Labor finally gave lip-service to the fact that the FBT net is cast in such a wide fashion that the cost of compliance is exorbitant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, with this particular piece of legislation Labor has shown that it still has very little interest in real reform but is instead pre-occupied with milking the fringe benefits tax system for as much as it can. The review not only is a disappointment to me, but has totally frustrated tax professionals who were inclined to believe the government's rhetoric. Labor has missed a golden opportunity to review the merits of the FBT policy, rather than just tinkering around the edges as this legislation intends to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now recognised that the fringe benefits tax, when first introduced, was intended to ensure that all forms of remuneration were to be taxed on a logical and consistent basis. The government claims that the FBT has been extremely successful in achieving that objective, yet what they do not tell us is that they have accomplished this by massive overkill. The FBT has grown way beyond what was originally intended, which was to close a relatively small tax loophole. It was to tax those benefits which were substituted for employment related income, pure and simple. Since then the FBT laws have become a millstone around the neck of the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the government sees the FBT achieving equity and efficiency in the tax system, those affected see the administrative nightmare more focused on revenue raising as opposed to good tax law. When the government announced its review of fringe benefits taxes, the business community hoped that Labor had finally recognised there is a real need for reform of this particular impost. The review was a response to complaints from business that the FBT generates excessive paperwork costs for the private sector and that the impost has become an unintended source of revenue in many respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Annamaria Carey of the tax institute was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 25 January as saying `most people think the FBT is just a way of raising additional tax revenue'. That is very typical of people in professional organisations. In 1986-87, the first year that the tax applied, the government collected $535 million with the fringe benefits tax. By 1989-90, the FBT take had increased to $1.2 billion. In the 1994-95 budget the government estimated that it would garner FBT revenue to the tune of $3.2 billion&mdash;though this has been revised now to $2.7 billion&mdash;and $2.8 billion for 1995-96. Obviously this tax is no fiscal slouch. It appears, though, that Labor just cannot get the message. Simple laws are required to make the FBT regime fair, uncomplicated and cheaper to comply with. Labor has failed to meet even its own objectives, let alone those set for the government by the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 24 February this year the Treasurer (Mr Willis) announced this package of measures, resulting from the government's review of the FBT compliance costs. Unfortunately, the announcement was too long in the pipeline. This review offers little hope that the government is taking the issue of tax simplification seriously. The FBT legislation was expected to have been introduced into this House at a much earlier date. As the shadow Treasurer has pointed out, it is to apply retrospectively in most respects from 1 April this year. To debate a bill almost six months after it is supposed to have application is a disgrace. The government seems to assume that this bill will pass through the parliament without amendment. But what happens if it is amended? It has happened before. Where is the certainty in the law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill reduces some compliance costs associated with car parking, taxi travel, entertainment and living away from home allowances. The government will, however, increase the tax on employer provided cars to 10 per cent to offset the expected losses in revenue. But the real issue is the cost of compliance. Michael Evans of KPMG was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 29 July commenting specifically on this bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's evidence of the complexity of our tax system that an attempt to cut the cost of compliance for companies adds another 60 pages to our FBT law.</PARA>
<PARA>Any sizeable increase in the size&mdash;that is the wording&mdash;of tax legislation will, as a matter of course, add to the cost of compliance. It is axiomatic. When the FBT Assessment Act was last consolidated on 31 December 1991, it was 293 pages long. Since then, there have been 16 FBT amendment bills and two additional statutory rules. The act is now well over 300 pages long. It is no surprise that since 1991 the cost of compliance has been continuously escalating. The cost of compliance, along with the spread of the FBT, comprise the most insidious aspects of the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that since 1987 through to the 1996-97 FBT year there will have been six different fringe benefits tax rates. These constant changes only add to the exorbitant costs of complying with the FBT. Businesses face a cost of more than $1 billion each year in compliance costs. Of these costs, it is clear that the fringe benefits tax is one of the greatest contributors. In 1989-90 the compliance cost for the fringe benefits tax was something like $128 million, which was 10.2 per cent of the total fringe benefits tax revenue of $1.2 billion. This 10.2 per cent applied to the 1990-91 FBT year. Since then the impost has been applied to entertainment and car parking. You do not have to be a genius to expect that this percentage will now be much higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time employers spent complying with the fringe benefits tax laws was annually an average of 1,100 hours. That equates to a half-time worker for the typical firm subject to the fringe benefits tax. The compliance costs for employers' PAYE was $629 million, which was only 1.4 per cent of the total gross PAYE tax revenue. For payroll tax the compliance cost was $206 million. Australian businesses spent up to 11 times more than companies in the United Kingdom complying with their direct tax obligations. Analysis shows that in 1990-91 96 per cent of companies on average in Australia incurred higher compliance costs, of $10,139, than they remitted in income tax, which is an average of $7,079. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally enough, compliance costs are higher for small business. Small firms with a turnover of under half a million dollars spend on average three per cent of their turnover complying with taxation rules compared with 0.02 per cent of turnover of companies with a turnover in excess of $50 million. So it is that compliance costs unfairly discriminate against small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that the FBT legislation in Australia is well over 300 pages long. Compare with this with the situation in New Zealand. The New Zealand fringe benefits tax provisions are not part of a separate act but are instead divided between two different tax acts. However, the sections dealing with fringe benefits tax only come to approximately 51 pages, as against well over 300 in Australia. It should, therefore, be of no surprise that the cost of complying with the FBT is far lower in New Zealand. The Institute of Policy Studies in New Zealand conducted a study of business tax entitled `The compliance cost of business taxes in New Zealand', published in 1992. Chapter 5 deals with New Zealand's fringe benefits tax and opens with the following paragraph, which I feel puts the FBT and any comparison with New Zealand in some context. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This method of taxing fringe benefits is unusual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The usual way is to impose a charge on the value of the benefit in the hands of the employee paid by the employee, at his/her marginal tax rate (although the employers will normally be required to furnish the tax authorities with details of the benefits).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the OECD countries, and possibly of all countries, only New Zealand and Australia tax employers for the fringe benefits they provide to employees; New Zealand was the first country to adopt this system.</PARA>
<PARA>The survey found that the FBT compliance cost in New Zealand was 1.73 per cent of the total revenue collected. How does that compare with Australia? As I mentioned earlier, the cost of FBT compliance in Australia is 10.2 per cent. This is almost six times the cost of compliance in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is also interesting, however, is that the compliance costs for PAYE in Australia and New Zealand are 1.4 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, yet there is such a large discrepancy between the FBT compliance costs. Obviously there is a need to simplify the FBTs in Australia to make them more concise, easier to understand and less expensive to comply with. The irony is that the New Zealand government with less legislation and lower compliance costs, actually garners more revenue from its FBT on a per capita basis than the Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to some of the detail in the bill because it covers a fair few clauses and I will not have time to deal with all of them. The bill amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Administration Act 1986 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. It is supposed to reduce the costs of complying with the fringe benefits tax. It makes changes to the treatment of entertainment, living away from home allowance, car parking, FBT exemption for certain other benefits, taxi travel provided to employees, section 65 rebate for medical research bodies, declarations, car benefits as against the statutory formula, and substantiation rules and retention of records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to entertainment now allow employers to choose one of three methods to determine their FBT liability. There is a fifty-fifty split, with half being subject to FBT and the remainder being non-deductible to the employer; a 12-week register to gauge the FBT exposure of the employer; and the option of determining the FBT liability on actual entertainment expenditure over 12 months. This measure is unnecessary, because the government, if it were really serious about reducing compliance costs, would exclude entertainment from the fringe benefits tax and remove the deductibility of entertainment expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifty-fifty split also appears to be unrealistic though. The Corporate Tax Association makes the valid point that the fifty-fifty split should be used as a standard, but where a difference can be justified it should be allowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the measures relating to car parking benefits and taxi travel provided to employees are expected to cost the government $76 million and $45 million respectively in 1995-96. Yet to maintain this so-called revenue neutrality, Labor has jacked up the statutory fractions used in the statutory formula to determine the taxable value of a car benefit. Funnily enough though, this increase will gain the government $121 million in 1995-96, which is exactly what it loses by the changes relating to car parking and taxi travel. There is no reason for the government to increase the fraction rate, except to recoup revenue forgone in making alternations which are plainly warranted anyway and on their own merits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes outlined in this bill are not concessions, but are long overdue improvements and corrections to bring the legislation more into line with its original intent. The government has proved its critics right once again. Fringe benefit taxes are not about equity but about revenue. The draft taxation ruling TR95/D13 confirms that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consider these as a couple of examples. An organisation sets up a promotional stand at the Royal Perth Show which is open to the public and at which food and drink are consumed. If any food or drink is consumed by an employee, whether he is working on the stall or otherwise, then FBT is payable. This would apply if an employee was not working, passed by the stand and downed a glass of wine as they went by, or probably a paper cup of wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the employee entertains a person who is an employee of an associated company and is subsequently reimbursed, then an FBT liability accrues to the associated company. Where an employee is travelling and dines with a non-travelling employee or client and the employer pays for both meals, then the costs of the travelling employee's meal will be subject to FBT and deductible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if the employer had only paid for the non-travelling employee's meal, it would not be subject to FBT and would still be deductible. Where is the logic in it all? In the first case, the meals are regarded by the Australian Taxation Office as entertainment but, in the second, are regarded as sustenance. The draft ruling defines entertainment as a diversion or amusement to the recipients, so do not smile when you are eating if there are ATO inspectors around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporate Tax Association makes the point that where a travelling employee dines with a fellow traveller they are not being amused but merely sustained. If they dine with a non-traveller and eat the same food in the same place with the same number of people present, they are, all of a sudden, being amused rather than sustained. I have been to meals with a lot of people&mdash;none of my colleagues present&mdash;where I have not been amused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless of who the traveller is eating with, they are being sustained first and foremost and not necessarily amused. Such definitions defy logic. Only the non-traveller who has a meal paid for is being entertained. Surely when the government announced the review of FBT the aim was supposed to be to reduce the cost of compliance while protecting the tax base and overall equity. It is clear that the review process has not been approached in an appropriate manner by the government. Commonsense should also prevail, and it is sadly lacking. The government should seriously examine the New Zealand model to achieve its stated goals. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

During the previous speech, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) was reading a paper and obviously paying no attention to the words of wisdom that were given to us.

I look forward to more of the same for the remaining months that he will have in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to go through some of the details of the legislation that is designed to reduce compliance costs with respect to the fringe benefits tax. Firstly, with regard to entertainment, there is the provision to close loopholes to ensure, for example, that corporate boxes at sporting venues are not business premises and that, therefore, food and drinks consumed on those premises are subject to the fringe benefits tax. Secondly, there is a fifty-fifty split on entertainment costs to ensure that compliance costs are reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The living away from home allowance is subject to technical changes in definition with respect to the food and accommodation that is exempt from the fringe benefits tax. It is intended to simplify the guidelines and, again, to reduce compliance costs. There is a simpler averaging formula provided for car parking in order to determine the value of the parking benefit. The fringe benefits tax will apply only where there is a commercial parking station which charges more than $5 per day within a one-kilometre radius of work. This will be a specific benefit to employers in regional areas, where generally such arrangements are not available and, therefore, fringe benefits tax will not apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, there will be an exemption of certain benefits from the fringe benefits tax. An example is car phones and mobile phones that are used almost exclusively or overwhelmingly for business purposes. Another exemption of particular importance for workers is taxis that are provided for either sick workers or workers who are leaving work later than 8 p.m., which is an award provision in many awards. Those taxi costs will be exempt from the fringe benefits tax. I certainly applaud that change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax will be rebatable to non-government and non-profit medical research bodies currently engaged in research. Declarations will be available for the fringe benefits tax on employee declarations relating to mixed business and private use. There are some changes to the formula involved in calculating car benefits, which are again designed to reduce compliance costs. Finally, the substantiation rules have been amended in order to bring the fringe benefits tax legislation into line with the Income Tax Assessment Act general substantiation rules that apply to tax deductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these are intended to reduce compliance costs to make record keeping for business, including small business, simpler and less costly. As has been pointed out by previous speakers, this is the result of a review conducted by the government relating to compliance costs for business with respect to the fringe benefits tax. It is true, as the honourable member for Curtin outlined earlier, that taxation in this country, including the fringe benefits tax, is becoming increasingly complex. I will make some observations about that in a little while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the fringe benefits tax, it is important to remember the background to the introduction of this tax. Perhaps before the honourable member for Curtin bleats too much about the damaging impact of the fringe benefits tax on costs on business, he might recall where the fringe benefits tax came from and why it emerged. Basically, it emerged because in the early to mid-1980s many businesses began to engage in outrageous tax avoidance activities designed to effectively increase salaries for their higher paid employees, particularly professional and managerial staff, and avoid tax, thereby, in effect, reducing their own salary burden in some fairly naked and blatant ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, we had situations where screen jockeys and the like in the financial markets in the mid-1980s were on salaries notionally of $25,000 a year but were receiving fringe benefits in excess of $100,000 a year that were at that stage not taxed. That is a fairly gross example of tax avoidance being pursued by the very companies that the honourable member for Curtin now seeks to defend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Honourable members on the other side of the House should keep in mind what the origin of this tax was. It was introduced because the credibility and the integrity of the system was being eroded by the more outrageous avoidance mechanisms being pursued by many companies in Australia. That is why we have it. Ultimately, that is why it is becoming increasingly complex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of amendments to taxation laws that I see in this place are responses to new avoidance brainwaves that have been produced by somebody out there trying to undermine the taxation system and to erode the integrity of the tax system to avoid tax. Yes, we do have a problem with respect to the complexity of the taxation laws but we need to keep in mind where that problem has come from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth keeping in mind that, at the time of the introduction of the fringe benefits tax, as commonly happens with changes in taxation, a lot of organisations were crying wolf about the likely impact of the changes. Plenty of people on the other side of this House were also asserting that extraordinary things would follow. The restaurant industry, which is a very important industry in my electorate, was going to collapse as a result of the fringe benefits tax because the hordes of businessmen who spent thousands and thousands of dollars on long lunches would suddenly disappear because those expenses would now be subject to taxation. </PARA>

It would have meant that your average person in small business would have spent hours every week doing paperwork and compiling documentation on the inputs and flowthrough of goods and services in their business in order to comply with the goods and services tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit amusing to hear some of the bleating that comes from people such as the honourable member for Curtin on these issues when we recall that at the last election the Liberal and National parties proposed a tax reform, so-called, that would have increased compliance costs on business in this country massively&mdash;out of all proportion to anything that business currently has to deal with. So it is something of an irony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth making a few broad observations on the tax system and some of the difficulties the system faces in the context of this legislation. Since the late 1970s, taxation has been demonised by conservative forces in most Western countries. We have seen things such as proposition 13 in California in 1978 and a proliferation of efforts to undermine the credibility and integrity of taxation as a legitimate part of a contemporary Western society. This is partly related to a proliferation of private choice options in advanced industrialised societies. As we have advanced into a range of different activities and different choices in leisure, luxuries and so on, there has been an increase in individualism in society and a desire for people to have greater control over their own expenditure and greater choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are underlying economic reasons as to why this has occurred. But what we see is businesses, on the one hand, promoting, at vast cost, endless arrays of products which people often do not want and, on the other, telling people that they cannot afford to pay the tax that is necessary to sustain a decent health system or decent education system. In effect, there is a crowding out phenomenon with private greed crowding out necessary social expenditure in the public sector. We have the idea that taxes are in some sense a burden, that they are eaten up by the public sector, when in fact taxes are in essence the price that we all pay collectively for mostly essential goods and services provided, again collectively, through the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the idea that taxes inhibit freedom. In a general sense, taxation promotes and enhances freedom. If you would like a simple illustration of this, look at the arrangements in Australia under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, an eminently socialist arrangement, which I applaud. It ensures that the vast bulk of people in the community have access, at reasonable prices that are generally affordable, to essential drugs. If you think that is not important, try living in a country where even the most basic prescription costs $100 or more. That is what taxation is ultimately about: it is society collectively ensuring that all of its members have reasonable access to basic, essential things that are part of living in a modern community. Mostly it relates to things that do enhance freedom, such as transport, libraries, universities and hospitals. Ultimately, taxation is the glue that holds our community together, that ensures that we all live, in spite of the differences, inequalities and variations, in one society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth while recalling the work of Robert Reich in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Work of Nations</EMPHASIS>. He highlighted the growing problem in the United States of the separation of wealthier communities, professional suburban communities, from the vast bulk of the community where everything is being privatised. Health, education, public parks and almost everything associated with living is being privatised for the wealthy so there is a growing disparity in life, in existence, between the better off and the worse off to a point where the two worlds barely collide. I do not think anyone would like to see such a situation develop in this country. It does not exist now. Taxation and redistribution of wealth through the tax system are an important means of ensuring that does not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been structural stresses on the tax system and these are growing. Internationalisation is obviously one. In a sense, our tax system is competing with those of other countries. Changes in the production process and technology are making it harder to tax. Advances like the Internet are going to produce phenomena which will make it even more difficult. The prospect of the development of an indigenous currency on the Internet and services being exchanged through the Internet internationally will make it very difficult to tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rise of services in the economy is equally a problem. It is generally a lot easier and a lot more acceptable to the community to tax the exchange of goods, whereas it is a bit harder to keep track of exchange in services. As I mentioned before, individualism within the culture is also a problem. Avoidance and evasion of taxation since the 1970s has been fairly widespread in the community, facilitated and indeed encouraged by some extremely irresponsible judgments by the High Court under Sir Garfield Barwick, who is a very able and very diligent representative of a class in the community very aptly tagged by Geoffrey Barker as the resentful rich who resent the fact that they should have to pay any tax to anybody for anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GST was initially proposed as an anti-tax avoidance measure, amongst other things, including its earlier variety&mdash;option C. One of the things we will increasingly recognise is that, as change occurs in our society, as increasingly services predominate, as we become internationalised, as computerisation becomes more predominant, the problems we have with avoidance of tax based on income are going to become just as difficult and just as prevalent with respect to avoidance of tax on expenditure. So I think the proposed advantage for shifting taxes to consumption is gradually going to disappear.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also seeing the leaching of progressivity out of the taxation system. That is an infinitely more significant problem. So we are seeing a reduction in the scales under governments of both persuasions: the full imputation of dividends; the abolition of inheritance taxes; the lowering of company taxes; the de facto privatisation of superannuation and pensions; the reduction of council rates; and the Hilmer process of competition policy, which is leading to an erosion of cross-subsidisation within utilities and equivalent organisations&mdash;all of which is reducing the overall progressivity of our tax system. That is something to which we need to give some consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reduction is not occurring purely as a result of political forces.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those pillars have been the basis of Western industrial society certainly since the Depression, and they are under threat. They are being eroded. We have to ask ourselves whether we are still committed to progressivity, to redistribution and to collective provision of goods and services, which is a fundamental component of fairness and equity in our society. Australian politics, in recent times, has made it pretty difficult for people who want to reform the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen from both sides of politics some fairly effective scare campaigns on tax issues at elections. In the 1980 election, the Liberals were pretty good at convincing everybody that the Labor Party would introduce a capital gains tax that would do all sorts of things. At the 1993 election, of course, the Labor Party was pretty effective at persuading people that a GST was not such a good idea. So it will be very difficult to address a lot of these issues. It will be very complex. Ultimately, we will be forced to address the structure of our taxation system by a lot of these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope sincerely that we will be able to maintain progressivity and redistribution as fundamental principles around the taxation system. It will get increasingly difficult to do so because of the forces that have been unleashed by technology, internationalisation and the like. We have to ask members on the other side, people in business and people representing the better-off in our community whether they still have a commitment to these things. Certainly, they did in the past. The Menzies government, for example, was committed to the notion of progressivity and social solidarity, underpinned by the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are elements in the conservative forces in our society who are no longer committed to those things. We need to ask the opposition an important question: irrespective of argument about individual detail about whether the FBT is a burden on business and compliance costs or whatever, is there still a basic commitment to this principle? If there is not, we have a very serious problem in our community, and it is something that we need to be addressing in some considerable depth, beyond the sorts of scare campaigns and difficulties that we tend to get into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the legislation to the House. I have endeavoured to show that not only does this bill improve things with respect to compliance costs and the administration of the FBT, but the problems that we are experiencing with taxation in the community are not problems merely associated with the government.

But they refuse to take it to a point of effectively doing anything about it. So the criticisms made by Sir Roger Douglas in June are effective and correct. I repeat the criticisms: there is nothing more crude and brutal than a government that seeks electoral advantage by refusing to make economic reforms that are desperately needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate today is on the fringe benefits tax which applies to employers and the way in which they treat their employees. It is not a tax that worries the majority of Australians. We have seen the same attitudes of acknowledgment by members of the government of the need for change due to the massive cost of compliance that is limiting the capacity of small business. Nobody in the small business sector, or its representatives, is arguing for rejection and dismissal of the fringe benefits tax. They are saying, `Make it simpler for us. You are cutting down on our time available on the job. You are cutting down on the time that we can be effective in our businesses by loading on to us a regime that is impossible and crude.' As one of my colleagues said, it is costing approximately six times the amount of time and energy for businesses in Australia to administer this tax than it is to their colleagues in New Zealand to administer the same tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be complicated and we have to be sure that those `horrible employers' are not running away with one cent. The horrible employers are saying, `Just give us a go. By making it simpler, we will pay whatever you want us to pay. We know we have to pay tax. We are not asking you to take the tax away; we are asking you to make it easier to administer so that we can use that time for making profits, for looking after staff or for employing more people.' They want to succeed. They regard all this government claptrap, rubbish, form filling and record keeping as counterproductive&mdash;and it is counterproductive at the end of the day because the objectives can be achieved in another way. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a further part of the argument, I refer the House to a leading article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> by an editor who wrote about the government's reforms in taxation. In the area of the fringe benefits tax, last Friday the editor said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By extending FBT to a wide range of minor benefits and, more important, imposing it on legitimate business entertainment, the Government has lost sight of the need to ensure that the tax system takes proper account of the legitimate costs of doing business in the real world, not just the very artificial world of the Canberra bureaucracy.</PARA>
<PARA>The review of the fringe benefits tax that has been undertaken by the government was done in an unreal world of the Canberra bureaucracy because, as they visited various representatives of business, the Canberra bureaucracy could not understand what life was like in Sydney or Melbourne or parts remote from Canberra. They are remote from the real business world. They are remote from where people work. They are remote from the circumstances, for instance, requiring women in large cities to take taxis home at night or when it is raining or when they are ill. They are remote from the concept that if a person has a mobile phone they will phone home and say, `I am delayed,' and they will use the phone that is handy to them, their mobile phone, which is a legitimate use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they have a laptop computer they will put their personal accounts on it if they are going to do a quick calculation. The government has been trying to draw the line between private and business use and has been asking business to keep a record of how many minutes have been spent on the mobile phone for private use and how many for business use, and the same with the laptop computer. Can you imagine anything so ridiculous as taking your laptop computer home and doing your accounts at the weekend and being asked to keep a record of how much time you spent on the laptop for your private as compared with your public use? The government is scrapping those two items, but it has put in place greater complexity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take the taxi item, for instance. Instead of saying that all taxis for staff are a fringe benefit, they are saying that only those taxis used between the hours of six in the morning and eight at night are a fringe benefit. But, if they use a taxi after dark, if they do not use it too regularly and if it is raining or they are sick, it is not a fringe benefit. Who in the world will keep those records? You have made the thing more complex, not simpler. The use of a taxi in these circumstances for employees going home from work now has two options. Was it in the daytime? If yes, fringe benefits is paid. Was it after dark? If no, no fringe benefits if you fulfil this formula, and you have to write it all down to see whether you are exempt from a fringe benefits tax. This is stupidity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the name of simplification&mdash;and that is the name of the legislation; it is the FBT simplification bill&mdash;you have made the thing more complex by giving people more options in the answer.

It is going to be terrible out there for people to try to keep the records they require. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 17 September stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Willis, yesterday attacked the Opposition's proposal to reduce capital gains and fringe benefits tax . . .</PARA>
<PARA>We have not said those things. The Treasurer is out of his tree. He is responding to crazy comments. These comments were outlined by a previous speaker in this debate for the Labor Party. He said that if we have a complicated tax system then it is the fault of small business and not the fault of the government. The theme of his argument was: do not blame us, we only wrote the legislation; blame small business, they have made it complex. The Treasurer is saying that we have to make it complex because we have a lot of nasties out there. He is not trying to think it through and achieve the simplicity that the Australian community requires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we examine the fringe benefits tax we find that the government thought it was a small tax which would raise $500 million. It now raises over $2.7 billion per year. This has been achieved by a process of extension and complication. In a feature article in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, Access Economics outlined the record of the Keating government in the tax field over its period in office&mdash;that is, the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claims of the Australian Labor Party that the OECD says that we are the second lowest taxed country in the world only picks up on one chart. The way the government gets at that figure is quite amusing. They say that all countries in the world include social security payments as part of their tax system. Australia does not. We compare our system which does not include the social security components&mdash;it includes health&mdash;with those systems that include social security payments. </PARA>

That is a lie and a manipulation of the truth by the Labor Party&mdash;the members of this government. It suits their argument. It is not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxation system in Australia is complex. It is the thing complained about most by business.

There was a headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> entitled `Misleading claims by Prime Minister Keating that Australia is a low taxed country: more compulsory super'. That is a fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax burden on Australians is substantial and they do not see benefits from most of it. The Treasurer's claims about the changes this legislation will make to the cost of compliance are patently untrue. In an interview with Monica Attard on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program on Friday, 24 February, the Treasurer made claims about the changes to the current legislation. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They dramatically reduce compliance costs for employers by taking a lot of small items out of the FBT net, and also changing arrangements for calculation of benefits of things like car parking and entertainment in a way which will considerably reduce compliance costs for employers, as well as also actually reducing the coverage of the FBT for quite a lot of car parking and for taxi fares. So, it's a pretty good package all round.</PARA>
<PARA>I have illustrated what I feel about the fringe benefits tax on taxis required by employees. If one runs through the items the government has claimed it is simplifying and one looks at the raft of formulas, ideas and options, one must assume that the government has deliberately set out to mislead employers, tax agents and the Australian community, because in every instance the options and processes are more complex than they were previously. Sure, mobile phones and laptop computers are out of the system, but the rest has just been made more and more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have from the National Tax Accountants Association and the Australian Taxpayers Association the illustrations that they use for the formulas that must be applied by people seeking to follow what the government has actually done. The pages of their documents are headed `FBT Warnings'. Let me give you an example of what the government is doing. There are three methods by which new entertainment rules can be applied&mdash;not one but three. They are the actual method&mdash;where the actual cost is kept&mdash;the 12-week register method and the fifty-fifty split method. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Doesn't that make it interesting for employers to have these three options for their business? They have to work out which is going to be the best and easiest to apply. The actual method is the existing method and requires employers to keep actual records of the expenditure incurred. The expenditure must be allocated between employee and non-employee costs, but the Taxation Office accepts a per head basis of apportionment. The 12-week register process is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employer must elect to use this method. It requires the employer to maintain a register for a continuous 12 week representative period in a FBT year to determine the ratio of employee and non-employee entertainment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ratio is then used as the basis for taxing the total yearly expenditure on food and drink. The ratio can continue to be used until the total yearly meal entertainment varies by more than 20% from the first year.</PARA>
<PARA>At that point a new register is started. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new register is required every five years.</PARA>
<PARA>Isn't that simple? That is great simplification! Then there is the fifty-fifty split method. This is the third one. The first is the actual cost and the second is the 12-week register for five years. But if the amount goes up by 20 per cent you have to change the basis, and you have to find out whether there were employees or non-employees at the meal, who paid for it and how you apportion that. Then there is the fifty-fifty split method, outlined as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If an employer elects to use this method, the total yearly expenditure on meal entertainment must be apportioned 50/50 between employees (and their associates) and non-employees.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">WARNING: By adopting this method, you are choosing to pay FBT on all employee meal entertainment regardless of whether it is deductible or non-deductible for income tax purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>Most small businesses say, `Who cares. You charge me what you like. I'm not going to keep that rubbish. Come in and raid me and tell me how much I owe you.' They cannot stuff around with this sort of thing. They are absolutely sick of the claims made by the tax office and the bureaucrats on their lives. Corporate boxes at the tennis and elsewhere are used generally for advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Car parking involves another change. There are two methods in the car parking system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current car parking rules require employers to calculate a car parking benefit if the car has been parked at or near the employee's primary place of employment and there is a commercial parking station within one kilometre of that location.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Car parking records and the employer's FBT liability commence from the day the lower all-day fee of any commercial car park within 1 kilometre exceeds $5.00</PARA>
<PARA>The second method is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second method provides employers with three alternatives for determining the number of car parking benefits provided during the FBT year.</PARA>
<PARA>He makes that calculation. It is the lowest rate within one kilometre of where the place of business is. What a mess! What a process of justification people have to go through to establish whether or not they are sticking to the rules.</PARA>

We have got 15 houses of parliament in Australia's states and territories; the national government makes rules for small business in New Zealand. It is true that we ought to get it together.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax is an important part of a fair tax system. That fairness includes acknowledging that there are some applications of fringe benefits which are legitimate business expenditures. Without a fringe benefits tax there would be a great diversion of incomes into benefits. If we look at the situation before 1986, we will see how true that is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A manager, director or other relatively highly salaried person could receive a car, fuel, servicing, vehicle registration, high-class meals, education for their children, a rent-free home, newspapers, entertainment or football tickets.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even some members of parliament benefited. The base salary in the mid-1980s was about $55,000. An electorate allowance might have been $17,000. Many members spent the whole of their electorate allowance on electorate and office expenses; I know that I did. But some did not spend that. If they did not, the unspent allowance was tax free. So a member of parliament could be $2,000 better off by not paying tax on the benefit and an executive could be tens of thousands of dollars better off. While all this was happening, of course, most wage and salary earners earning less income paid much more tax. Posties did not have a free car, long lunches, entertainment and education for their children in a private school while other people were getting that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more simple the collection of tax, the better. Of course, fairness often requires complexity, but not always. This government simplified income tax by taking the 60 per cent top marginal rate down into the forties.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the consideration of the fringe benefits tax and a range of other taxes, in 1984 this government suggested a consideration of a value added tax or a form of goods and services tax. That approach generated widespread hostility: businesses were hostile; farmers were hostile; the unions were hostile; the states were hostile; and the Liberal and National parties were hostile. Eventually, after a summit which was held in the Old Parliament House, that suggestion was replaced with an option that included a fringe benefits tax along with a capital gains tax, the prescribed taxes and a different tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After setting up the new system and getting it in place&mdash;which was difficult enough&mdash;the opposition changed its mind, the farmers changed their minds and businesses changed their minds.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is trauma with any change in the tax system. There is a cost to business and government. The government was naturally reluctant, especially under the economic conditions at that time, to once again change the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are points against a GST. There are points in favour of going the way we did with the fringe benefits tax and other taxes. First of all, a GST can be avoided by people. People who are producing and selling can sometimes avoid the tax. The GST is an act of faith. I suspect that the opposition still supports a GST. I point out to the opposition that a GST is an act of faith by low income groups. People who pay little or no tax at all would be paying far more tax under a GST. Every time they make a purchase they would pay the tax. They would pay taxes on clothing and food which they have never paid before. Pensioners, wage-earners, low income investors, small businesses and farmers with low incomes would be paying more tax. They would have to trust us in this parliament to boost their incomes so that they could pay the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that that might be done for pensioners and it might be done by backing wage increases for wage-earners to make up for the extra tax that they would be paying. However, we must remember the occasions when we have had wage pauses and there have been no wage increases. We can recall the days of the previous Fraser-Howard administration when pensioners were asked to share in the wage pause and put up with no increase in pensions. What would happen to small businesses with low incomes? What would happen to farmers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax took courage from the government. Admittedly, the GST takes a lot of courage, but there are two forms of courage. There is a silly quixotic type of courage, and there is a courage which is tempered with foresight. The GST took courage all right! It was a new tax for Australia. Other countries that have introduced the GST have, almost inevitably, lost the next election. In Canada, the government, which was made up of progressive conservatives, was reduced to a rump of two people. In Japan we saw a change in government after decades of Liberal Democratic rule&mdash;decades. In New Zealand there was a change in government after the introduction of a goods and services tax. Only the UK managed to hold their position, but that was because they created a war&mdash;the Falklands War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal-National parties showed even more courage than all of those countries put together. The courage of the Liberal-National parties astonished even David Lange, who was prime minister at the time of the introduction of the value added tax in New Zealand. They announced a proposed new tax before the 1993 election. They also announced an industrial relations policy and a policy of privatisation of Telecom and lucrative parts of Australia Post. They lost what they thought was an unloseable election, not just because of the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compare that with the sort of courage that you can get with a bit of foresight, with a fringe benefits tax and other taxes to prevent fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance. That sort of courage saw the introduction of an assets test so that people who were receiving pensions and who did not have many assets apart from their home were able to receive a higher benefit. Those who had high value assets&mdash;in some cases millions of dollars worth of property&mdash;were no longer entitled to receive pensions or could receive only a part pension. So the government showed courage with foresight when it introduced that option which included the fringe benefits tax. I hope the government will keep that up, because we now have a low inflation recovery and we have a lot of people out there who want to return to the boom conditions. It is easy in small business, for instance, to blame the fringe benefits tax for some of the problems of small business. They really want to return to the boom conditions. They forget the busts that follow the boom conditions. I admire the government for being about keeping a low inflation cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> that came out this week has on the front page a wolf in sheep's clothing. It points out how the United Kingdom and the United States are relaxing their resolve about inflation. They are starting to think that some inflation will give some growth. They are lowering their vigilance. Just as fringe benefits without a tax is a trick on low income people, inflation growth is a trick on workers. It is as insidious as fringe benefits being given to high income people. Under higher inflation, the governments would allow higher prices in the hope that workers would allow wages to stay where they are. Workers resist wages dropping back, but they do not resist wages not going up to the same extent. Similarly, pensioners do not resist their pensions not going up to the same extent that they would if they were reduced. So governments are tempted into allowing high inflation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to contribute to the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill 1995. I welcome the opportunity to be part of the debate on this important legislation. This bill is a very belated recognition by the government that the fringe benefits tax compliance costs are still far too high. Whilst acknowledging that there are some changes which will improve things, the reforms proposed in the bill do not go nearly far enough. Businesses which are trying to become more efficient in today's internationally competitive environment are still being strangled by the fringe benefits tax compliance costs. The administrative complexity and excessive regulations imposed by Labor's fringe benefits tax mean that precious resources such as time, labour and materials are all tied up in red tape. Far from improving the economy's efficiency, the fringe benefits tax compliance costs dampen entrepreneurial spirit, overload business operations and impede further investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the whole fringe benefits tax structure are urgently needed but the measures proposed in this bill are not nearly enough. A recent survey of Australia's top 100 companies has revealed that the so-called improvements to the fringe benefits tax will cost these companies an additional $28.7 million each year. Current fringe benefits tax compliance costs are running at an estimated 10.9 per cent of fringe benefits tax revenue. This stands in stark contrast to the example of New Zealand, where compliance costs are only 1.7 per cent of the fringe benefits tax revenue. So it is still a very complex and inefficient tax in regard to compliance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures reveal the hollowness of the government's rhetoric about trying to help small business in this country. There is no doubt that the fringe benefits tax compliance costs are having a harmful effect on the productivity of Australian businesses. The Australian Manufacturing, Engineering and Construction Industry Association has noted that some of its members are faced with compliance costs equivalent to employing three full-time staff. In other words, just complying with the cost of the fringe benefits tax is costing Australians jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small and medium sized businesses are even more disadvantaged than larger corporations. They cannot afford the extra staff to cope with the paperwork created not only by the fringe benefits tax but also by the many other taxes they have to face every day. These include the PAYE tax, income tax, payroll tax, workers compensation, and the superannuation guarantee levy, to name just a few. Scarce resources are also spent on training employees to keep up with the frequent changes to what are extremely complex and difficult administrative rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of the impracticality of these arrangements is the difference between the fringe benefits tax accounting period and the normal tax year. The normal tax year ends on 30 June each year, but for the fringe benefits tax that period ends on 31 March each year, adding another element of complexity and cost to business out there in complying with government regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax legislation is far too complex and unwieldy. There are over 250 definitions, 260 separate sections and nearly 300 pages of legislation. In contrast, in New Zealand, where there is a fringe benefits tax, the legislation is less than 50 pages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many business operators report difficulties in complying with the complex factual requirements and onerous documentary evidence obligations to secure what are intended to be exempt benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax compliance cost structure is very inequitable between different classes of taxpayers. For example, all employees are assumed to be on the highest marginal tax rate of 48.4 cents in the dollar. This means that the tax has no regard to the progressive tax rate system applying to employees' salaries and wages. This, quite clearly, is blatantly unfair, particularly in the light of some of the benefits made subject to the tax, such as car parking and taxi fares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing fringe benefits tax structure has clearly extended its scope in recent years beyond that intended by the original legislation. Originally, the tax was designed to target non-cash employee remuneration used essentially for tax evasion purposes. Yet its current operation covers any benefits seen to accrue to an employee regardless of the purpose for which the benefits are provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A prime example of this occurs in the mining industry. Given the location of most mining sites, the companies often provide free housing and other so-called benefits to their employees. These are regarded as necessary for a number of reasons. Life in many mining communities, particularly in remote Australia, is not particularly easy. The remoteness of many of these mining locations makes living out in these areas not as comfortable as living in our capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These so-called benefits that the mining companies extend to their employees are really only measures to lift the standard of living of employees to something approaching that which people in urban areas take for granted. These benefits were also considered necessary to attract employees to these regions. Yet they are now subject to the fringe benefits tax. This is having a profound effect on the nature of work in these areas as well as on the nature of the traditional mining town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this nation today we have some very traditional mining towns&mdash;Mount Isa, Kalgoorlie and Broken Hill&mdash;in remote parts of Australia. Those towns grew around the mining operations in those areas. One effect of this fringe benefits tax has been that mining companies now resort to what is known as fly in, fly out. Instead of providing the accommodation and the associated benefits which are subject to the tax, the companies fly the workers in at the beginning of the working period and fly them out when it ends. This transportation of the workers in and out of these mining communities is not subject to a tax. As a result, companies often reject the idea of setting up permanent town sites in preference to the fly in, fly out arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mining employees have always been central to the existence of these communities, but their loss means that these settlements face the very real prospect of decline. In addition, a vibrant, well serviced community is needed to attract not only skilled workers, but other essential people such as doctors and teachers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of this situation is that fringe benefits attract these people to remote areas. But a fringe benefits tax attracts no-one anywhere. As a result, once thriving communities face decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mining communities established in Kalgoorlie, Broken Hill and Mount Isa, which were part of the decentralisation of this nation, would not be set up today by mining companies because of the fringe benefits tax. That would be the result of applying a fringe benefits tax to so-called perceived benefits that mining companies give to their employees in order to attract them to these areas. It just illustrates the government's hypocrisy about equity in this matter. It also makes a mockery of its so-called commitment to regional development. Those opposite mouth off in the House day after day and over the airwaves of this nation their apparent commitment to regional development. But, quite clearly, the fringe benefits tax and the way that it applies to remote mining communities is disadvantaging any chance of mining companies establishing mining communities that are sustainable in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You only have to witness Mount Isa, Kalgoorlie and Broken Hill today to see that there are viable communities there that were built around a mining industry. Those mining companies provided benefits to those employees to work and develop this nation. As a result, we have communities that are today of immense benefit to this nation. Today, under the fringe benefits tax rules, you find that mining companies are opting for the fly in, fly out operation because it is cheaper in terms of their own operations, and it ensures that their shareholders obviously get a higher dividend. That is a responsible position for the mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's approach to taxing the perceived benefits of mining companies in remote locations in this country is quite clearly impeding regional development. It will continue to do so whilst ever this government fails to acknowledge that the impact of this fringe benefits tax on the remote mining locations in this country does encourage these companies to fly their employees in and out of the site rather than develop a community where that wealth is being extracted from the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the end of the bad news, because many important industries are located in rural and remote regions. One industry that this legislation hits is the pastoral industry in this country. It is still illegal for an employer to cash-up the benefits under state awards. I will quote clause 14(1) of the Queensland station hands award:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every employer shall provide all employees with accommodation free of charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Food shall be supplied to the employees of sufficient quantity, sound, well cooked and properly served by the cook.</PARA>
<PARA>The employer must provide these benefits under that state industrial award. Section 14 of the Pastoral Workers Accommodation Act 1980 states that accommodation is to be free of cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is also the case in the federal wool classers award. Clause 18 of the 1994 award says that the employer shall provide the employee with suitable board and lodging free of charge. If an employer were to cash-up this accommodation or perceived fringe benefits, the employee would be clearly in breach of the award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst union officials at this stage are probably turning a blind eye to this situation, nevertheless the situation still exists where these employers could one day find themselves taken to court on the basis of the technical breach of an award. Employers in Queensland are not permitted by law to charge fully kept employees for accommodation or food. This mandatory provision of free accommodation and meals under the Queensland awards prohibits employees from negotiating the value of any non-cash benefit, renegotiating the value of any provided benefit or withdrawing any benefit which has been provided in accordance with the requirement of the award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, employers in Queensland under these state awards are in a very difficult position, and the fringe benefits tax only adds to the complexities they face. The employer has no right to exercise a choice. The employer is forced by law to provide a benefit but is then taxed on that provision, while the recipient is not taxed at all. This is a tax that employers pay. Whilst it might be argued that employers can claim a tax deduction for the payment of fringe benefits tax on behalf of their employees, if you are not paying tax the tax deduction is not worth anything to you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just another tax on the people in the pastoral industry in this country. Out in many parts of rural Australia, farmers and pastoralists have experienced five years of drought. According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, many have recorded negative incomes. A tax deduction is not worth anything in these cases. So the fringe benefits tax the employers have to pay for these perceived benefits under mandatory industrial awards clearly ends up as another tax with no benefit to the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I also want to touch on how the fringe benefits tax is impacting on local government in this country. Under the rules of the fringe benefits tax legislation and under the grossing up provisions, local governments are now paying the equivalent of 98.3 per cent tax on the benefits that they may be providing to their employees. Local governments are being unfairly treated under the grossing up provisions of the fringe benefits tax regime. Why? Because local governments do not pay tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government as a non-taxable entity does not receive the benefit of the tax deduction for the fringe benefits tax. Therefore, they are paying fringe benefits tax at the 98.3 per cent level. Given the upcoming requirements of competitive neutrality under the national competition policy, it could well be argued that it is reasonable that local governments should expect to be able to pay fringe benefits tax at the same rate as their potential competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst this bill does go some way towards simplifying what is a very complex, bureaucratic piece of legislation that impacts unfairly in some areas, this area of tax law is still too complex. The bill has not addressed the issue of the local government inequity; it has not addressed the issue of the remote mining communities; and it has not addressed the issue of the industrial awards in Queensland, such as the station hands award, where employers have to provide certain benefits as part of an industrial award. Quite clearly, those are issues that the government has no regard for. I hope that, in time, we will have the opportunity to address these issues. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst there are some improvements to the general scheme of fringe benefits tax law embodied in the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill, I echo the sentiments of many small business people, and certainly many of their clerical employees&mdash;some of whom I had the pleasure and honour of employing myself before I was elected to this place&mdash;and express their hatred of this scheme and their urge for reform. Hopefully, after the next election, when those of us on this side of the House are in government, we will have the opportunity to make some of the reforms which my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) outlined yesterday in a speech at the Old Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the ironic things about the bill we are debating today is that it seeks to simplify the fringe benefits tax law. But it adds to it 60 pages. How can you seriously come into the House and say you are going to simplify a tax scheme by adding 60 pages to it? Members in the chamber today may observe that I have not taken the opportunity of asking the attendants for a lectern, the reason being I brought with me the tax act. I do not need a lectern for my notes today because, as is obvious to everyone who can see this, the tax act in its full majesty is high enough to support my notes. I understand that when I was born the tax act was some 342 pages long. It now exceeds 5,000 pages and, by the end of today, it will be another 60 pages long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no secret these days in the business community that the nature of the tax office has changed in recent years and that the pressures arising from the budget deficits that this government has thrust upon the nation have given ascendancy within the tax office to the hawks, the hard line revenue raisers, as opposed to the moderates who seek, in their duties in the tax office, to make it fairer perhaps from the point of view of the taxpayer. This change in the nature of the tax office was described by a former officer of the tax office, Mr Douglass, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> last month. He described the change in the culture that was made when reporting lines were changed from a vertical nature to that of a horizontal nature. He stated that this gave ascendancy to the accountants within the tax office as opposed to the lawyers who were more interested in procedural fairness. </PARA>
<PARA>That is perhaps a small matter in comparison with the stupefying mess that fringe benefits tax law is. The bill before us today carries the parenthetic title `FBT Cost of Compliance'. I intend to make a few remarks on the substantive provisions of the bill and also I want to elaborate on the proposition that the cost of compliance is greater than the pecuniary or financial cost borne by the employers who must pay this tax. The cost to the investment climate within Australia of an overcomplicated and intrusive tax regime is almost unquantifiable, but it is certainly very great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering this stupefying mess, I put to the House three propositions. The first one is the obvious one: that, as technology changes, and as the incidents and the nature of employment grows more complicated year by year, the revenue raising means of a government will likewise need to change and adapt to those changes in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second proposition is that, in effecting that adaptation of the tax law to cope with the changes in the workplace, a government that chooses a very mechanical and intrusive approach by enacting highly technical legislation that imposes a tax liability on the employer&mdash;which is exactly what the FBT law is&mdash;that government will thereby fetter or restrict that employer's ability to produce profits and a return on equity invested. Restricted likewise are the employment prospects for the pool of labour from which that employer draws its staff and, of course, the further investment prospects that the employer might otherwise undertake, such as the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) described when talking of the trouble that some of the mining companies have in his electorate as a result of FBT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of compliance, which is what this bill is supposed to be all about, goes beyond the financial penalty to the employer; it goes also to the opportunity cost that is lost by the burden placed on those employers. In that respect, it is well to remember that everything a government does, every law it passes and every administrative act it performs, has an effect on the psychology of investment in a jurisdiction whether it be a state or a federation such as Australia. So you must take into account the atmospheric effects of what a government does as well as the technical beauty or technical ugliness of whatever it proposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such atmospheric effects, in particular of this FBT, are illustrated I thought very clearly by a report from the APEC Capital Markets Working Group, a group of business and financial market leaders established under the rubric of APEC to lobby the government to strengthen efforts for Australia to become a major financial centre for the Asia-Pacific region. In doing that, we are competing against other countries, other capitals&mdash;New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong. In studying the tax law that confronts foreign companies when they consider whether to establish a regional headquarters in Australia to service these markets, this group reported that Australia has now:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an international reputation for being unsympathetic to regional headquarters and a taxation system considered to be a significant disincentive.</PARA>
<PARA>That is plain. That is what you get when you enact a highly technical and intrusive tax law. That is what I mean by these atmospheric effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one thing to say that you are trying to achieve vertical equity or horizontal equity between taxpayers in seeking a more thorough approach to taxing benefits in kind, which is really what fringe benefits are, but it is another thing to do it in such a way as to harm the future prospects of an economy and the workers within it. It is a terrible thing to poison the investment atmosphere in that respect. It is my view that the direction of tax regulation, the trend and the quality of our investment atmosphere, is getting bad as time passes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the report by Access Economics boiled up and was debated with some vigour in question time yesterday. It is now 10 years since the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;or the Treasurer, as he then was&mdash;introduced these changes to our tax system. It astonished me to learn that the tax burden on Australians is actually greater than it was then. That is strange in view of what the Prime Minister said on 19 September 1985 when speaking in this House: `The benefits of tax reform will be shared among all Australians.' If an increased burden is of benefit, I can understand why a lot of people no longer regard the Prime Minister as credible in what he says. You cannot persuade me that paying more tax is a benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I saw this bill on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and put my name down to speak to it, I started to do a little bit of research on the subject. Being of a curious nature, I went to the library to inquire what the situation was regarding benefits in kind before the FBT, before this monster was born. I do not know whether to describe the fringe benefits tax as a monster; perhaps `disease' is a better noun to use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I discovered that before this regime benefits in kind, fringe benefits, were taxed with a combination of common law and statute&mdash;that is, decisions by courts as well as provisions in the tax act, as it then was. The main taxing provision was section 25, and the government enacted section 26(e) in an effort to catch these benefits in kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, let us have a little look at the common law, as it then was. It began in England last century with a case called Tennant v. Smith. In that case, a bank housed one of its bank managers in a provincial English town. When the Inland Revenue sought to tax the value of that accommodation given to the bank manager, the case went all the way to the House of Lords, and the House of Lords ruled that there is no taxable income if the benefit is not in money or money's worth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was followed by another case, Abbott v. Philbin, where the court decided that an indirect ability to turn the benefit into money or money's worth was enough to call it income and therefore to have it taxed. This led to some strange rulings in other parts of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following that principle, there was in New Zealand the case of Dawson v. Inland Revenue Commission where a company which I understand manufactured colour televisions issued a bond or a debenture and offered the investor the free use of a colour TV instead of its paying interest on the bond. Surprisingly, the court in New Zealand said that this was not taxable because you could not convert the free use of a colour TV into money or money's worth. That is a somewhat extreme example of what happened to the common law. It certainly was not the case here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia the courts decided, as late as 1980, in the case of FCT v. Cooke and Sherden, that the English doctrine that there is no taxable income unless the benefit can be turned into money or money's worth should be accepted here in Australia, and we did accept it. So we had a body of judicial law, a judicial concept of income, which matched the legislative provisions that were in force at the time, section 25 being the main taxing provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislature enacted section 26(e) to cope with fringe benefits. When I read it I frankly could not understand why we had gone to such a complicated scheme of FBT, because when you read the words of that provision it seemed pretty plain that it would catch the sorts of things that employees receive these days called fringe benefits. What is taxable is described in section 26(e):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the value to the taxpayer of all allowances, gratuities, compensations, benefits . . . given or granted to him in respect of . . . or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of or services rendered by him, whether . . . given or granted in money, goods, land, meals, sustenance, the use of premises or quarters or otherwise . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That seems to me to be a very broad provision. I cannot understand why it was held to be inadequate. There must have been something wrong with the way it was enforced, or with some of the decisions of the High Court in the late seventies and early eighties, that the court in the New Zealand case went to an extreme in holding that some of the more contrived tax avoidance schemes were lawful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps that is why this government, when it was first elected, saw the need to rush in and burden us with an enormous and complicated scheme to replace what struck me as a perfectly well drafted legislative provision. As I have said&mdash;and pointing out that I did not need my lectern&mdash;you can see what this government has done by way of burdening us with all sorts of tax schemes since it was elected. You can look at the size of this pile and see why I make that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In trying to frame a legislative scheme to collect tax off benefits in kind, or fringe benefits, you have to make sure that there are two solid legs to the scheme. The first is that the legislative scheme must examine carefully and properly the nature and the purpose of the benefit that the employee is receiving. You have to ask whether it was really a reward to the employee or whether it was an unavoidable business expense that the employee happened to be the beneficiary of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, the second leg of a good legislative scheme to tax benefits in kind must be a proper valuation of that benefit. When you go back and look at section 26(e) you see that the nexus for the benefit received by the employee is drafted in a wide fashion, directly or indirectly, and the valuation of that benefit is described as the value to the taxpayer. There is a bit more common law on that which I will get to later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It struck me that this provision should surely apply to many modern situations. If it caught non-income receipts to taxpayers in those days, then I cannot see why it could not be used today if the tax office performed its duties in a more diligent fashion rather than sought help from the legislature and, in doing so, poisoned the investment atmosphere. That apparently was not enough. We ended up with the birth of this monstrous FBT. As you see it has grown ever since. It has grown more complicated as time has passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I went back and read the then Treasurer's second reading speech when introducing the FBT scheme I found that he sought to explain the need for the scheme by saying that there was widespread non-disclosure of benefits in kind. Maybe there was. That gave rise in my mind to the issue: why was the tax office not out there frightening people with the prospect of an audit so that they would disclose the benefits in kind that they were receiving. There must have been something wrong with the way things were done then if people felt they could get away with not disclosing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, he said that the existing law had a poor test of valuation in saying that the value to the taxpayer was not somehow sufficient in judging how much of these benefits should be subject to tax. That gave rise to a general rule instead of giving separate consideration to the benefits derived by each taxpayer, which seems to me to be a sensible way of doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle that lies behind self-assessment is that we obey the law and put our tax return in and if we seek to defraud revenue by misstating our income or understating it we run the risk of being punished. That is a perfectly legitimate scheme to have in a country where people are generally honest, as I think Australians are. There were other things behind the introduction of the FBT that the Prime Minister did not see fit to disclose at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade unions said that many fringe benefits won by workers on work sites around Australia were really not benefits so much as property rights. Before I was elected, I was engaged in the construction business&mdash;earthmoving, irrigation and so forth. There were certainly many things that we provided to our employees, as part of their jobs and according to the award, as a matter of occupational health and safety. They certainly regarded them as hard won property rights rather than benefits in kind given by a generous employer such as myself. Somehow or other you can see the influence of the trade union movement in persuading its government. There is no more generous earthmover employer in this jurisdiction or any other where I have worked. My former employees who came to hear my maiden speech, among other things, will always be willing to testify to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back to this stupefying mess. You can see the influence of the trade union movement in persuading its representatives in the parliament that we should shift the burden of paying tax on what were, in some cases, obviously derived fringe benefits to the employer, with no regard to the effect on the investment atmosphere. There is not really much more I can say other than to recall a statement by a long dead English judge who, when looking at documents comprising a general law title deed, said, `They were difficult to read, impossible to understand and quite disgusting to contemplate.' That is exactly the way I and many of my electors feel about this fringe benefits tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Tax Research Foundation, in its study entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The compliance costs of employment related taxation in Australia</EMPHASIS>, identified the fringe benefits tax as the most administratively expensive tax for employers and the one which was most likely to require outside help to administer. This study found that in 1989-90 the compliance cost of the fringe benefits tax totalled a staggering $128 million or just under 11 per cent of the total FBT revenue. That is the compliance cost; that is not the cost of paying the tax. If we look at the actual FBT tax projected for this financial year&mdash;$2.8 billion&mdash;and extrapolate those figures, as my colleague the shadow Treasurer did yesterday, we will find that the total cost of compliance is $300 million per annum.</PARA></TALK.START>

In addition, about 66 per cent of businesses liable for FBT employ a professional adviser to undertake the compliance aspects of this tax. This type of tax structure epitomises this government's lack of commitment to the small business sector. It is a government that basically does not understand the dynamics or the nuances of small business and it is content to simply wring every tax dollar possible from that sector of the economy to prop up its thirst for big government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Treasurer (Mr Willis) announced on 10 May 1994, in the context of the 1994-95 budget, a review of the FBT compliance costs, small businesses around Australia thought that the madness associated with many aspects of the FBT would at long last be addressed. They were somewhat heartened by the Treasurer's promise that not only would this review take place but also it would be completed and action would be taken by the end of July 1994. It was all too good to be true; the Treasurer quickly returned to type. The final report of the review sat on the desk of the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) gathering dust for no less than 243 days before the government announced what the benefits would be for the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that this review was initially promised to be completed by the end of July 1994 and was not implemented until April 1995 highlighted the government's total lack of consideration for the impact on or the cost to small business of complying with this particular tax. The government is oblivious to the fact that small businesses are responsible for managing the bottom line of their financial affairs. Funds are limited and must be allocated to issues of priority. There is no such luxury for them of imposing additional costs on their customers and clients to recoup the cost of government excesses and mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer and the small business minister should do a quick financial analysis and figure out what productive use small business could make of the around $900,000 a day, if it was not being squandered on FBT compliance costs. The funds could employ a lot more people, purchase a lot of new capital equipment or support a lot of productive investment. If the 243-day delay was imposed on the small business community, on today's estimate of $900,000 per day for compliance costs it would add approximately $200 million of needless cost to the operation of Australia's 860,000 small businesses. That is, the total cost is estimated at around $200 million. That is needless cost. That is simply the cost of complying with this tax. It does not include the cost of paying the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the small business minister profess their support for small business and do plenty of public hand wringing about small business issues, but when it comes to the test of action and commitment their words have a very hollow ring. The rhetoric is more evident than any meaningful action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small business minister stands condemned by the small business community for continually ignoring requests for action on this particular issue. It is not unusual, though, for the government to delay things, do a lot of public hand wringing and have a lot of enquiries, committee hearings and so on, but fail to translate that into meaningful policy, particularly in the small business area. Eleven months after receiving the final report on the review of franchising, for example, the minister for small business has indicated that this will be the week when he will announce the government's response to the issues of importance in that sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is typical of what we see from the government when it rushes into this place at five minutes to midnight with little time for industry groups to consider the implications of the recommendations. There are other examples of the government being aware of major concerns in the sector but delaying any consideration to address those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is clearly apparent is that the small business sector is being administered by a minister who has no passion for, or understanding of, the dynamics of this sector.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a few years after RATS tax reform continued in the heroic mould but, in the last few years, the Federal Government has shown signs of reform fatigue. That much of the legislation enacting the RATS proposals was hastily drafted and appallingly complicated on matters of detail has contributed to that fatigue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Armies of public servants have drafted what Richard Vann described last week as `a stupifying mess'.</PARA>
<PARA>This morning other colleagues have referred to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, of course, is not the fault of the very hardworking public servants who have to wrestle with these problems; rather it is a lack of leadership being demonstrated by this government. Small business can attest to and relate with comments of such honesty in respect of the FBT regime. They, not the out-of-touch small business minister, are the ones trying to manage a business and, at the same time, fight their way through the consequences of the government's stupifying mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform fatigue that Geoffrey Lehmann referred to is symptomatic of a tired, listless and out-of-touch government. The government has become too comfortable. We constantly hear various ministers extolling the virtues of export market development, international best practice, benchmarking, networking and the need for new paradigms in management practices. All of these issues are being promoted by a government that is in a period of stagnation and disinterest in the direction of the small business sector and, worse still, incapable of managing some of the basic fundamental requirements of the business sector in order for them to take advantage of the new global markets that are emerging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small business minister has been remarkably reluctant to offer advice to small business employers on how they can focus on the challenge of international market development, innovation and business management, while he supports the FBT regime that requires small businesses to constantly run around car parks checking the price of daily parking. It is just a ridiculous situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a joke; you are quite right. The government's disinterest in the viability and profitability of the small business sector is further underlined by the fact that in September 1985 the government estimated that FBT would bring in about $550 million in its first full year. Ten years on, the annual FBT take is forecast to increase to $2.84 billion in the 1995-96 budget. The government has been so busy gloating on the fruits of this tax that it has not considered important the pernicious impact that small business face in complying with the aspects of this tax, nor the stupidity of some of the current applications of the FBT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to listen this morning to your speech, Mr Deputy Speaker Snow, on this matter. I agree with you that it is very important that we deliver fairness, equity and simplicity in the tax system. I have no problem with that at all. But this country's 850,000 small businesses produce 30 to 40 per cent of our gross domestic product and employ 47 per cent of all Australians. We must recognise that they play a vital and integral part in producing an income base that allows this country to have good health facilities, good education facilities and enables it to look after its unemployed. I think it is high time that we get things into perspective and recognise that we have to look after our income producers&mdash;those people who are contributing to the pool of money that this government enjoys distributing in various ways throughout the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our small businesses not only look after their own needs; they help others in their community. If you have ever visited a country town, you would see that there is a stark understanding of how important small businesses are to the social fabric of those communities in which they operate. I think you are quite right that we do have to have a fair and simple system. I have not heard very many businesses complain about paying the fringe benefits tax where it is truly an offset against salary, where they are receiving benefits in kind in lieu of salary. I have never heard too many business people complain about that. What they are complaining about is the complexity of this system and the madness of tying up enormous resources in this country that could be going into productive investment and the production of jobs for the many people who are still unemployed in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer briefly to the Treasurer's comments of yesterday, which can be found in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. He named me and the shadow Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). He says that we are going around the country `winking and hinting' about changes to the tax system. I can certainly say that I have never talked about abolishing the fringe benefits tax where it truly applies to items received in lieu of salary. What I have consistently talked about with small business groups around this country is how we might address the huge cost of compliance, how we might simplify the tax and how we might make this a fairer application of paying tax. I have certainly done that, and I make no apologies for that. The Treasurer also commented:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know, having recently been through the process of looking at reducing compliance costs and making a number of changes to the system to reduce those compliance costs, that you cannot do it without losing substantial amounts of tax revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that is bunkum. I also suggest that it shows this is a very tired government and that it is indeed in a policy vacuum. If the government had a will it could certainly address this problem without damaging the revenue base. That is something the coalition is committed to trying to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a speech also delivered in this place this morning, my colleague the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) demonstrated very succinctly that while New Zealand has been able to introduce a FBT tax, the compliance cost of our FBT tax compared to New Zealand's is six times higher. That is a very fair demonstration that, if we had a will and if we had a mind and if we put ourselves through a bit of lateral thinking, we would be able to come up with a solution to the damaging and pernicious cost of collecting taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly this government cannot stand to see business conditions improve. The minute small businesses start to make a bit more money the government thinks it is a signal for it to just willy-nilly spend more and waste and squander taxpayers' money. When it runs out of money it simply puts up the tax. In the last budget the government demonstrated that it only put up the tax in one sector of the economy, and that was the small business sector. The small business sector bore the brunt of most of the tax increases in the last budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When announcing the review in 1994 the Treasurer did say that the aim was to minimise compliance costs while protecting the tax base and overall equity of the tax system. They were his own words. He has used the protection of the tax base argument as an excuse to increase FBT payable on cars to compensate for the loss of revenue in other areas. I suppose that was his stated agenda as well&mdash;that it would be revenue neutral. But the Assistant Treasurer announced that the package would dramatically reduce compliance costs. This allegation has been refuted by some business organisations. The Corporate Tax Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A survey of Australia's top 100 companies revealed that the so-called improvements to the FBT will cost these companies an additional cost of $28.7 million annually. The survey also revealed there would be minimal savings in compliance costs.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants has described the review as `a bald-faced revenue raising exercise which simply reshuffles the formula by which the government milks business for every last cent in an effort to raise its own revenue base'. Another accounting firm, in a Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu article called `Another taxing week', summed up the Treasurer's result as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Willis's result is disappointing, given the time and resources devoted by the business community to helping with this subject. Overall his effort seems to benefit Treasury rather than the business community.</PARA>
<PARA>While the small business sector will benefit from some of the changes to the FBT on car parking benefits as the amendments should reduce associated compliance costs, the amendments do not completely eliminate the need for employers to monitor changes in fees charged by car park operators. So we still have this ludicrous system where a business proprietor's time is taken up running around checking car park costs instead of getting on with the business of creating wealth and business for the benefit of all people in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is very evident that the small business community is going through a great crisis of confidence in the government's ability to deliver meaningful policies. We saw the Beddall report on small business delivered several years ago. We are still seeing the government unable to tackle some of the hard issues in terms of releasing small business from these wasteful processes of paying tax and complying with regulation and legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a reflection of the government's understanding of and interest in the impact of its policies on small business that in regard to this amendment and other amendments in the last couple of days specifically involving small business we have seen 25 coalition members contributing to the debate in this place, while only 12 government members consider small business issues important enough to come in and participate in the debate on these critical issues. The level of commitment will not be lost on the small business community. I support the second reading amendment which has been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is significant that the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill should be introduced 10 years and one day after Treasurer Keating released his tax reform package back in 1985. Yesterday in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, Mr Carmody of Access Economics reminded us of the 1985 tax summit and the white paper reform of the Australian tax system, which at the time was shortened significantly to the word RATS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper identifies several features of post-war tax history. Five of those features were: an increasing Australian tax burden, an increasingly heavy reliance on personal income tax and less on other taxes, a significant escalation in tax rates found by the average income tax earners, wide differences in the tax treatment of income from different investments, and the narrowly based high set of rates of consumption taxes. The government's response to these identified deficiencies was the introduction of dividend imputation, which was designed to eliminate the double taxation of company income tax, the introduction of income tax on most realised capital gains and the introduction of a fringe benefits tax. Access concludes in the white paper that the problems identified in the white paper are still with us. In some instances, those problems are worse now in 1995 than they were in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax has been a monster&mdash;a policy monster and an administrative monster. It has been a tremendous burden on business. But it is very clear that members of the Australian Labor Party do not understand business&mdash;they do not understand that a tax is a cost of doing business. When compliance costs become excessive, they become an excessive cost to business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an era of so-called micro-economic reform and competition policy, surely one should expect, and even the Labor Party must realise, that the burden of excessive compliance costs is anti-competition. It guarantees that the Australian business community cannot compete with foreign competitors. Excessive FBT compliance costs are anti-business and anti-employment. My colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Ms Moylan) pointed out a few moments ago that the compliance cost in Australia of FBT is six times that of New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when we are plagued by balance of payments problems, Australian companies are moving offshore in their droves to do business, we are relying on imports month after month, year after year, and our unemployment still hovers around 800,000 or more than eight per cent, why does the government persist with placing burdens in the way of business&mdash;disincentives, paperwork and red tape?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business people in my electorate say, `What's the use.' They see no hope. After 12 years of Labor, their only salvation is a change of government which, for them, cannot happen too soon. I remind the House of the inquiry conducted by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into the Australian tax system. The terms of reference of the committee were wide ranging. The committee did not have a charter to canvass tax policy, and it was very careful to avoid that. Policy is a matter for the government. The JCPA examined the administration of tax policy. It was a very high profile and emotive inquiry. Many people will recall clashes between members of the committee and the Commissioner of Taxation and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry, in excess of 120 submissions were received, amounting to over 5,000 pages of evidence. A further 1,600 pages of evidence were taken during the public hearings in 1992 and 1993. The committee tabled its report No. 326 in November 1993. All in all, there were 148 recommendations. The committee felt that 148 matters of an administrative nature, not of a policy nature, needed to be addressed. It was not about tax policy but the way that the tax system is run. On 23 August, the government responded to the JCPA report No. 326 and, in fairness, many of our recommendations were adopted by the government. The recurring theme in submissions and public hearings before the committee related to the burden of the high cost of compliance on business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee set about its recommendations. The high cost of compliance was a major factor in our considerations. As the inquiry proceeded, it was patently obvious that people upon whom the tax burden fell did not understand the complexity of the tax. Not only did the people upon whom the burden fell not understand the tax; their tax agents were confused by the tax. In many instances, it was again obvious that the Australian Taxation Office did not understand the tax. The system of rulings which the government introduced to clarify tax laws, in fact, added further to the confusion. The committee received evidence that it was not unusual for tax practitioners to approach different branch officers of the ATO who they knew beforehand would be favourable to their case or a request. Some officers of the ATO were very strict in their interpretation of the legislation and rulings; other officers were sympathetic. Tax practitioners soon learned where to go to get a favourable ruling. Under these conditions, what chance does the poor taxpayer have of understanding tax law when these blatant inconsistencies prevail?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us today is designed to simplify tax law. That is a clear indication that the tax law has failed and is complicated. If you need to simplify it, it is complicated. It was made clear to the committee that the major problem with our tax law is its complexity and the cost to business and individuals in complying with it. In every submission received which touched on the FBT, the major complaint was the cost of compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many instances, it cost more to comply with the tax than the tax itself. No-one would argue that benefits received in kind instead of cash should not be taxed. However, there is no justification in my mind for an FBT to be paid by the employer for a benefit received by the employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In 1987 the government figures showed that there were 138,360 employers caught in the FBT net&mdash;that is, 138,360 FBT payers&mdash;who paid a total of $521,810,000 in tax. By 1994 the number of FBT payers had actually declined by 10,000-odd. There were 128,000 people caught in the FBT net, but the amount payable to the tax office was a staggering $1.414 billion. So 10,000 fewer taxpayers were, in fact, paying three times as much in FBT as when the scheme was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the current budget, the FBT take is estimated to be $2.7 billion. It is no longer a measure to close loopholes in current tax law. It is now a new way of taxing business, purely to provide revenue to this cash strapped government which is in debt up to its eyebrows. There is only one way to pay for its extravagant expenditure and that is by increasing the net of the current taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade union movement prevents the government from exercising responsible fiscal policy on the expenditure side and forces the government to use revenue raising measures and borrowings to pay for its excessive spending. But let us understand this very clearly: FBT is purely a revenue measure which continues to spread its ugly tentacles way beyond the original purpose for which it was intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One recommendation of the JCPA report No. 326, which I personally strongly supported at the time, was recommendation 26 which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All future tax legislation be supported by a taxation impact statement which details the impact on taxpayers of the legislation including the total compliance cost and the extent to which simplification objectives have been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>In its response to report 326, the government supported this recommendation. But that was last year. I can see the papers associated with this bill, but where is the taxation impact statement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making this recommendation, the committee assumed that certain procedures would be followed and that consultation with business would have to be undertaken and the results of this consultation published. Was the trade union movement consulted? Are they subject to fringe benefits tax? I understand they are exempt from income tax. There is no indication in the bill or the supporting documents that such consultation has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find legislation appearing before us in this place which corrects things like errors in drafting, anomalies or unintended consequences&mdash;you can call it what you like. The simple fact is that the parliament quite often has to revisit legislation because it is wrong. That was the purpose of recommendation 26 in relation to tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister: where is the taxation impact statement? Who was consulted? What assurances do we have that this legislation before us is correct? How do we know that we will not be revisiting this matter next week, next month or next year? It flies in the face of the JCPA report to introduce this bill in September when its provisions come into effect in the previous financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the government treating the parliament again with contempt? Is the government assuming that this bill will pass through both houses without amendment? What happens to businesses which have lodged returns if this legislation is amended? Will the businesses be penalised? The government's logic on simplification and reducing the cost of compliance is flawed. If simplification and reducing the cost of compliance reduce revenue, it shows what an anomalous tax FBT and its administration add up to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Businesses in my electorate laughed at the government's attempts to redress the high cost of compliance. On the one hand the government reduces business costs, the cost of compliance; on the other hand you increase the rate of tax applicable to motor vehicles to make up for the revenue shortfall. That's clever! Tell me how business wins from that. Tell me how that reduces costs. Tell me how that makes it more competitive. Tell me how that addresses our balance of payments problem. Tell me how that creates more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the committee stage members will have a chance to examine each of these measures in the bill in detail. I presume the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) will be in the House in the committee stage and I want to address a number of questions to him on the question of consultation, a taxation impact statement which details the impact on taxpayers, including total compliance costs, and the extent to which simplification objectives have been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Treasurer, my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), in speaking to this bill foreshadowed an amendment in the committee stage to modify the hours of exemption from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. to take account of commercial realities. This amendment is in relation to that section of the bill which exempts taxi travel provided to employees for travel direct between home and work between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. and taxi travel for sick and injured employees to travel from their usual place of residence. We accept that this amendment which the Assistant Treasurer has introduced in this bill is a sensible one but we believe that our amendment to change those hours of applicability is more commercially realistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition quoted some of the tax experts in this country about the fringe benefits tax. It has been said before but it is worth repeating that, as much as we search the documentation, we do not find anybody who supports the way that this tax is applied. Bob Jeffery, the National President of the Australian Society of CPAs, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The so-called review of FBT has turned out to be just a thinly veiled exercise to appease genuine business concerns while still slugging business to raise the same amount of money.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting, when discussing the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill 1995, to consider the history of the fringe benefit tax. I can recall quite vividly that, when it was first introduced, the Treasurer at the time&mdash;the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;made a declaration that fringe benefits taxes would be assessed, and would be taxed to the employee and not the employer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within 24 hours, the ACTU boss&mdash;I think it was Mr Cliff Dolan&mdash;found out that his package had been arranged on the basis of free cars, free accommodation and free everything else and, apparently, got in touch with the Treasurer of the day. Within that 24-hour period, we had the fringe benefits tax's impact being reversed from the point where it should be, on the employee, onto the shoulders of the employer. I think we should always remember that this deep commitment that the Labor Party has had to a fair and equitable fringe benefits tax was determined solely on the point that the ACTU boss did not think it was equitable and told the Treasurer of the day that it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no trouble in understanding that fringe benefits should be assessed; I just have difficulty in knowing where that assessment should be. In this connection, abuses were there. Given the salary packages that were being offered&mdash;and it mainly was at the high end of the business area that they were being offered&mdash;by way of accommodation, light rental, education for children, motor vehicles, telephones and the whole lot of those things, there was obviously an abuse of procedures and they should have been assessed. Perhaps the only way around that was to tell the business end of town that these packages were not going to be tolerated in the future unless there was tax paid on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at that stage it was optional. The fact that the previous speaker pointed out that fringe benefits taxpayers have reduced from 138,000 to 128,000 since the time of the first impact, which was in 1994, indicates to me that many of the businesses took the options. They took those cars from the employees, or they gave them one-tonne utilities or things like that, which was okay. They took away those fringe benefits. But it was optional. To the extent that those businesses stayed with the system of paying their own taxes in connection with these benefits, it was recognised by them that these were legitimate expenses incurred in business and perhaps they should pay them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble today is that fringe benefits taxation is no longer optional. This is particularly clear when one looks at what have been, just in the course of this bill, described as fringe benefits, but really have no connection with FBT. Let us go back to entertainment: entertainment itself is no longer a tax deduction, as far as an employer is concerned. The aspect of entertainment still has within it a no-option basis for an employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look at the living away from home allowance. I might say that the biggest fringe benefit this government, or this parliament, ever paid was a living away allowance to the then Treasurer, Mr Keating. That was because the allowance was not paid for living away from home; it was an allowance paid for living at home. His own house in Sydney was being renovated and was unlivable, and he still declared it as his residence and was paid a living away allowance in Canberra. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That might be fair enough, but it is a fringe benefit. When I challenged this with the Taxation Office&mdash;in view of the fact that I did have a constituent who was having trouble with the Taxation Office because of a living away from home allowance and having to justify it&mdash;the Taxation Office came back and said that allowance was free from taxation in the hands of the employee. If that was the case, the government certainly should have picked that up and paid tax on it, because it was a living at home allowance, not a living away from home allowance. Yet that finds its way into the current web, but not in the same manner as I have just described. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for car parking, one is really scratching the bottom of the barrel when suggesting that car parking on an owner's premises is a fringe benefit. Those people have already gone through the rigours of town planning to indicate they are supposed to have the car parking blocks for the purpose they are using them for. To come now and suggest there is a tax payable on it because of certain criteria again insists that the car parking is no longer an option for an employer to avoid. So it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can talk in terms of those items which are now being excluded. One has to ask the question, `Why in the name of goodness did the government include them in the first place?' Could I mention them? Exempt items include mobile phones, car phones, protective clothing, briefcases, calculators, tools of trade, computer software for use in an employee's employment, electronic diaries, notebook computers and laptop computers, employee's subscription to trade or professional journals, membership fees and corporate credit cards, and membership fees for airport lounge membership. It just defies belief that in the course of this review we have been assessing employers on these types of benefits that were not benefits in any case. It just goes to show that there is no end to which this government will not go to try to include fringe benefits into the package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take taxi travel provided to employees. Under the safety and health regulations I would suggest that this is a prime concern to an employer. If an employee is working after hours and needs a taxi to get home safely, that should be supplied under the normal conditions under which the state says it should be. To suggest that taxi travel in those circumstances is a fringe benefit is an absolute nonsense. There is a long way to go in amending this act before we get back to the option that an employer has as to whether to pay the tax on the benefit or cash out the benefits, as many of them have already done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention has been made already of the New Zealand precedents.

It is 10.2 per cent of the cost of the tax itself. </PARA>

Recently in the House, we have had to put up with the stupidity of trying to simplify company law. It is not a simplification. It goes right back to imposing further burdens on small business. I would suggest that people within the Australian Taxation Office should have a couple of years experience in small business so they know exactly what the impact is. </PARA>

Having made that admission, I am probably going to be told that that is another fringe benefit and that the employer should be taxed accordingly. The cost of compliance which this bill is endeavouring to reduce begs the question of why it was so difficult to understand before and why the cost of compliance was so heavy. </PARA>

That is why small business is suffering as it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the fringe benefits tax was designed to cover abuses. But it is no longer optional. In fact, the whole thing is a miserly approach by the government to gather more tax so it can cover its huge spending agenda. I have to say that, over the last 13 or 14 years, this Labor government has made an art form of the acceleration of the payment of tax&mdash;and that is just the acceleration&mdash;and it has delved into every corner to tax items which should not be taxed in the way they are. Just as an indication, revenue collection for 1994-95 is estimated at $2.720 billion and for 1995-96 it is $2.840 billion. That is an indication in itself that this government is only interested in getting taxpayers to pay more taxes. </PARA>

This study also reveals that Australians are paying more in indirect tax than they would have under the coalition's goods and services tax plan. The report by Access Economics shows that workers have received a poor return for 10 years of income tax cuts under Labor. This is all hailed as part of the glorious tradition of tax reform. It is not tax reform; it is tax exploitation at its worst. This government has an addiction to raising taxes and slugging businesses and workers alike, often to the detriment of the economy. </PARA>

Board and accommodation requirements are written into the pastoral awards so that no pastoralist can charge an amount for that, and yet fringe benefits tax is applied to it.

Is it a fringe benefit to provide airconditioning and power in places where the temperature gets up to 35 to 40 degrees celsius? Is it a fringe benefit to provide annual visits to major centres, so that these people can leave their isolated surroundings and go elsewhere? Is it a fringe benefit to send their children elsewhere for education, when that township is so small that it cannot provide the education that is required? Of course, it is not. Many mining companies have now adopted fly in, fly out arrangements which as yet have not been accepted as a fringe benefit. </PARA>

A lot of people on the land would not, if the employee was taxed on the benefit, pay anywhere near the high rate of tax that applies to the fringe benefits tax; it would probably be half of what it is. Yet the fringe benefits tax is applied at that higher rate. The situation is even worse in many of the pastoral industries and establishments in my area. Although people are not earning sufficient income to pay tax, they are being called on to pay the fringe benefits tax on the grossing up system, and they get no relief for the taxation paid from the other end. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill 1995 is designed to reduce costs to small business but is going to raise another $121 million in the financial year 1995-96. It is also designed to reduce the cost of compliance to small business but overlooks many of the major compliance costs that small businesses face at the present time. The government proclaims that the bill will have a particular impact but an examination of it shows that it will do the opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill implements the results of the government's review of fringe benefits tax compliance costs announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on 24 February 1995. The review was announced on 10 May 1994 in the 1994-95 budget. The government anticipated announcing the results in July, but they were not announced until some seven months later. When announcing the review in May 1994, the Treasurer said that the aim was to minimise compliance costs while protecting the tax base and the overall equity of the tax system. He has used the protection of the tax base argument as an excuse to increase the fringe benefits tax payable on cars to compensate for the loss of revenue which will result from relaxing the car parking rules and exempting minor benefits such as laptop computers. The other changes are expected to have only a minimal effect on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review has been described by the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants as a `bald-faced revenue raising exercise which simply reshuffles the formula by which the Government milks business for every last cent in an effort to raise its own revenue base'. Others have also been disappointed that the review did not go far enough. Some have argued that the effect will not be revenue neutral but will increase the revenue take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government is to be condemned for its poor performance in relation to the review, something which small businesses and middle sized businesses, in particular, throughout Australia have been waiting for in the hope that there might have been some real action taken in terms of the costs of compliance with this taxation. After announcing the results of the review some seven months after the scheduled date, the government has now taken a further few months to introduce the legislation to implement the review and it has also made changes to the original announcement in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the ironies of the review is that employers who currently use the statutory method to calculate their fringe benefits tax liability on cars may switch to the alternative method, which has higher compliance costs, in order to avoid paying more fringe benefits tax. Of course, the review was necessary in the first place because of the widespread complaint, indeed widespread condemnation, about the cost of complying with this tax measure throughout the business community. In fact, compliance costs were unreasonably high in Australia and, even after this bill, will remain so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993 study by Pope, Fayle and Chen, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The compliance costs of employment related taxation in Australia</EMPHASIS>, estimated the total compliance costs of fringe benefits tax in 1989 at $128 million or 10.9 per cent of the fringe benefits tax revenue. That is, 10.9 per cent is the proportion of the revenue which is raised in order to comply with this taxation measure. They concluded that the compliance costs were high when expressed as a percentage of tax revenue and made the telling comparison with New Zealand, where the percentage is nowhere near 10.9 per cent; it is just 1.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So a comparison across the Tasman Sea shows that we have a compliance cost regime in Australia which is about 10 times as expensive as that which is operating in New Zealand. In other words, every one of the almost one million small businesses in Australia is paying, in complying with the fringe benefits tax legislation, 10 times the equivalent costs in New Zealand. We talk in this country&mdash;and we hear from the Prime Minister and ministers from time to time&mdash;about how we have to adopt international best practice, how we have to be competitive with the rest of the world and yet, when compared with New Zealand, Australia has this massive discrepancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you take the figures which were cited as the costs in 1989-90 in the report by Messrs Pope, Fayle and Chen and then you apply that percentage to today's figures, you come out with a result that the compliance cost to business for raising this revenue for the government is something like $350 million a year&mdash;$350 million a year which Australian businesses, many of them small business, are paying out simply to comply with this legislation in the first place. That is something which is unacceptable. It is something which hits small businesses very hard. The same study estimated that, so far as small businesses were concerned, the compliance cost represented 42 per cent of the fringe benefits tax which was actually paid by the small businesses themselves. So, if you get a situation in a small business where the cost of actually complying with the legislation is the equivalent of almost half the tax you pay, I think that points out how ludicrously high the compliance costs are. Here we have the Treasurer saying that this bill will dramatically reduce compliance costs, but when you look at the bill it will not do that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) announced that the package would dramatically reduce compliance costs. The Corporate Tax Association said that a survey of Australia's top 100 companies revealed that the so-called improvements to FBT will cost these companies additional fringe benefits tax of $28.7 million annually. The survey also revealed that there would be minimal savings in compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about FBT, it ought to be put in the context of the total tax system in Australia. If you look at what has happened to the tax system under this government, you will see that there has been over the period of the Hawke and Keating government a continual increase in the tax take from Australians, from individuals and from businesses. For example, since 1983 total individual tax has risen by 136.8 per cent. Total company tax has risen by a massive 370 per cent. Total indirect tax has risen by 149.8 per cent. Sales taxes under this government have increased by 305.7 per cent. This is the government the Prime Minister of which ran around the country campaigning against a GST because it was going to increase taxes on ordinary Australians, yet here he is, day after day, month after month, year after year, increasing taxes on ordinary Australians through company taxes and indirect taxes and others included. The total tax revenue will also have gone up by 189.8 per cent with taxes&mdash;if they had all been effected&mdash;that were announced in the budget. So you can see that over the period of this government there has been a massive increase in taxes in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also see that, compared with those countries which we were repeatedly being told we have to compete with, some of our tax rates are not competitive tax rates. For example, if you take company tax rates in our region, you will see that, compared with a company tax rate of 36 per cent in Australia, Hong Kong's company tax rate is just 17.5 per cent, Taiwan's is 25 per cent, Singapore's is 27 per cent and Indonesia's, Thailand's and Malaysia's are 30 per cent. The company tax rates for operating businesses in those Asian countries which directly compete with us are all below the tax rate here in Australia. This week we have had a report from Access Economics which says that the total tax burden on workers in Australia is greater now than it was 10 years ago when the now Prime Minister, then Treasurer, Paul Keating, unveiled his tax reform package to slash marginal tax rates to, as he said at the time, restore some fairness and credibility to the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that fine sounding rhetoric, what he has done is continually rip off more and more tax from more and more Australians, whether they be individuals or businesses. In fact, those on average earnings of $28,348 a year are paying just $4 a week less in income tax now than they did in 1985, when average earnings were less than $19,000 a year. When the superannuation guarantee levy charge is added to the equation, the total tax burden is greater today than it was in 1984-85, for all but the highest income earners in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that points to the other phenomena which is continuing to occur in this country, and that is the gap between those who are poor and those who are very rich, which continues to widen in this country. Here we have a government&mdash;a Labor government&mdash;that proclaims the virtues of egalitarianism and has actually presided over the greatest change in terms of the widening gap between the poor and the very rich in this country, and it goes on today, even as I speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the particular bill before the House, I said at the outset that one of the things which this bill purported to do was to reduce compliance costs. Yet, in fact, it overlooks one of the major concerns of business so far as complying with the legislation is concerned, and that is the misaligned reporting period for fringe benefits tax compared with the income tax year. The fringe benefits tax year, of 1 April to 31 March, and the income tax year, of 1 July to 30 June, are obviously misaligned, and this has enormous costs for business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxpayers have continually requested that the FBT year of tax be aligned with the income tax financial year, under the Income Tax Assessment Act, due to the prohibitive compliance costs of the FBT year of tax straddling two financial years. An intolerable situation has occurred for business in this country since July 1986, wherein, in order to determine the FBT taxable amount, an employer must first review two separate accounting periods, being the period from 1 April to 30 June and the period from 1 July to 31 March in the subsequent financial year. In order to avoid any unfavourable negative cash flow consequences, all that would need to be done in relation to this would be to change the quarterly FBT instalment dates, which can be done pursuant to section 103 of the fringe benefits tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, when the government talks in this legislation about reducing compliance costs, the most obvious compliance cost which is facing business&mdash;the most obvious compliance cost which business owners and operators have to face year after year&mdash;is a reporting period for one system of taxation which ends on one date and a reporting period for another system of taxation which ends on another date. That involves a great deal of additional paper work in aligning those two periods, in terms of the records and the returns of each and every small business in Australia that is subject to FBT and to other taxation. All that needs to be done is to align those two periods. Here we have a government saying that this is a massive reduction in the compliance costs for business, while the most glaringly obvious matter which could be corrected is simply left uncorrected in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also other examples where the government has not taken any steps to change the legislation and, therefore, the costs that remain on business. The meal entertainment allowance and problems arising with that have been referred to by other speakers. It is interesting to read a story on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of Wednesday, 16 August this year, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is losing out on a share of the $600 billion in wealth generated by the Chinese diaspora in Asia because of high taxes, high labour costs and a complex tax system, the Federal Government has been warned.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's tax system&mdash;particularly the controversial fringe benefits tax&mdash;was regularly cited by ethnic Chinese as the key constraint on their investment in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FBT, as it applies to business entertaining, was seen as unnecessarily penalising one of the main ways in which Asian business people do business: over a meal and outside the office.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not a report which has been written by somebody sympathetic to the coalition; this is a report which comes from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The government's own bureaucrats, their own advisers, are saying, `Here is a major problem as far as investment in this country is concerned.' There is a major bucket of investment from the Chinese quarter available, but it is going elsewhere. And why? Because we have an uncompetitive tax system in this country and, if we do not do something about it, that situation will continue to apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to go through all the deficiencies in this legislation. They have been pointed out in some detail by the shadow Treasurer. What concerns me is the failure to go further and to address the real problems with compliance, problems which can just be enumerated in the time available here. There is difficulty in the preparation of FBT returns spanning the two financial years, as I indicated. We have a situation where employees must complete declarations, but the employer is responsible for the information contained therein. This is inequitable and time consuming, for both the employer and the tax office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are problems with phones and car parking&mdash;car parking having been pointed out by others in the duration of this debate. There are also problems with housing benefits, some of which were pointed out by a previous speaker in this debate. There are many other problems. For example, for self-education purposes for income tax, an individual must deduct the first $250 under section 82A. Yet, if the employer pays the self-education expenses of an employee, for FBT purposes no such requirement exists. The tax office also says that, where a long-distance truck driver receives an allowance for meals and incidental expenses, he or she is only exempt from substantiation if the allowance is reasonable and he or she is away for five nights. If you are a public servant and you are away for more than 10 hours, you do not have to substantiate a reasonable allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem&mdash;and there are myriad problems which time prevents me going into this afternoon&mdash;is that, where an employer is required to provide sun hats and sunscreen for employees to protect them from the sun, the Australian Taxation Office will apply the FBT to the benefit provided to the employees. How ridiculous can things get! In this country we have had campaigns going on now for over a decade to reduce the incidence of cancer&mdash;in particular, to reduce the incidence of skin cancer, particularly in the more northern parts of this country but also in southern states, such as Victoria, whence I come&mdash;yet, if an employer provides sun hats and sunscreen to an employee, this is regarded as a benefit for which fringe benefits tax must be paid!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in a nutshell, encapsulates some of the problems with this legislation. It is legislation which has obviously been written by bureaucrats in an office in Canberra who have no real appreciation for the real world outside this city. The real world, in which Australia hopefully can stride forward, will not be generated in this city; it will be generated outside in the areas in which small businesses are trying to operate, despite all the problems which this legislation fails to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the difficulty with this legislation is that, as usual, the government says it is doing one thing but, when you read the fine print and look at the way in which it actually will be applied, it is having the opposite effect. There is much more that needs to be done as far as fringe benefits tax compliance costs go in Australia. If we are going to be a competitive nation, we have to make sure that in this country the circumstances exist in which small businesses, in particular, can go forward in a way which gives them confidence that they can compete on terms which are equal to, if not better than, those for small businesses in other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to do that, this legislation needs a great deal more refinement than has been generated by this particular bill. In some cases, this bill is not going to aid the situation but is actually going to put small business further behind the eight ball. For those reasons, and for the reasons which will be addressed in more detail in the consideration in detail stage of this bill, we find that this is a highly inadequate way in which to try to deal with compliance costs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It is ironic that Access Economics has now produced a report which shows that Australians are now carrying a greater tax burden than in pre-reform package days.

The FBT is manna from heaven for a tax-and-spend government like this one. Any time you need a bit more cash to pay for out of control spending, just widen the FBT net a bit more.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the government seeking to stop tax evasion but what we take issue with is the method. Even these new amendments, while going some of the way to alleviating compliance costs, still have problems. Let us look at a couple of areas. There is the living away from home allowance amendment. This benefit arises when an employee is paid an allowance in the nature of compensation for additional expenses incurred, and other disadvantages suffered, because the employee is required to live away from home to perform employment duties. This amendment provides that the allowance will only be a fringe benefit where the total period for which the employee has lived or is required to live away from his or her home is less than four years for a foreigner or Australian posted overseas or one year for an Australian resident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is involved in this? While this will introduce greater certainty about when an employee is considered to be living away from home for the first time, employers will be required to provide declarations which will duplicate the employee declaration. In addition, before the taxable value of the benefit can be reduced for accommodation, the amounts spent have to be substantiated, thereby increasing compliance costs yet again. This is reform ALP style&mdash;more paperwork and more compliance costs within the bill to reduce compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, why is there a differential between domestic postings and foreign postings or between Australian residents or temporary residents? One wonders whether we will be back looking at this in the future in yet another fringe benefits tax amendment bill. The real sting in the tail is the statutory formula for car benefits. The government has lost some revenue by making it easier for business with other measures, so it is going to belt business to make up for it. It is no coincidence that this measure is being targeted at the most commonly provided benefits, and that is cars. It is another revenue hit to the tune of $121 million in 1995-96 and $91 million each year thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will not see this government giving up any revenue, unless it is an election issue when it makes lots of promises and commitments about lowering taxes so it can break them at the first opportunity. Under this amendment, employers are given a choice. They can reduce their compliance costs by using the statutory method but they will have to pay higher tax, or they can pay a lower tax cost by staying with the operating cost formula but pay higher compliance costs as a result. What a choice! It is lower compliance and higher tax or higher compliance and lower tax. Either way, business ends up paying the price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think that this government might consider lowering compliance and lowering tax, but not this tax-and-spend government. I often ask myself how anyone who knows anything about business could continue to come up with such convoluted schemes, but then it dawns on me. They keep coming up with these schemes because they do not know anything about business. They have never worked in business or been in a position where the health of a business is vital to its profitable outlook. The FBT convolution simply reflects the background of the members of the government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the problem is not an isolated one. It is symptomatic of their whole approach, as evidenced by the lift in company tax and wholesale sales taxes on cars, and also the attempt to put the WST on building products. This government promised not to impose any new taxes. But to feed its spending frenzy and to support its loose fiscal policy at the time of the last budget, it imposed extra taxes on companies, lifting the company tax rate from 33c in the dollar to 36c in the dollar, and lifting company car tax from the 15 per cent threshold to 20 per cent, and now to 22 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government lowered that tax from 20 per cent to 15 per cent, the Prime Minister said that they were proposing to lower the rate permanently to 15 per cent. We now know that `permanent' in this government's terms means a very short period; in fact, until such time as it needs to get more money to feed its spending habit. This happened despite promises to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this, the waterfront is going backwards, labour market reform has stalled and onerous requirements have been imposed relating to native title. This is all symptomatic of a government which is out of touch with the sector that generates growth and employment&mdash;the private sector. These things make it harder to do business in Australia and make it more tempting for businesses which can move offshore to do so. Why, for example, is BHP opening operations in South America, despite the vast mineral resources in this country? BHP's investment in job growth will benefit the citizens of Chile, but not those of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This example, and others like it, should be ringing alarm bells for this government. We need to keep as much activity as possible in this country. We need to make it easier for businesses to do business in this country and to employ Australians. That starts with the budget. We need to ensure that tax is as simple as possible to collect and pay, and is as low as is reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To assist in this, we need to ensure that government spending is as low as possible within the parameters of legitimate government activity. This is clearly not the case. Spending is too high, having almost taken on a life of its own in recent years. This causes increasing pressure for more and more taxes, and this means that areas such as fringe benefits are placed under increasing pressure to feed government coffers. This bill is a case in point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So great is this government's need for tax that it is not possible to simply reduce compliance costs to absorb the revenue impact. Tax must be lifted in the same bill to offset it all; so business is no better off in real tax terms. As I mentioned earlier, the problem you get in this country with these sorts of taxes is that we still have 750,000 Australians unemployed; a record foreign debt of $180 billion; the worst current account deficit in the OECD, and growing; and underlying inflation starting to grow to boot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a vibrant business sector devoting as much time as possible to doing business, not filling out forms to satisfy bureaucrats. This bill is a very small step down that road; there is still a vast amount to do. The difference between the government and the opposition is that we will take on the hard yards, not just talk about doing it. As I mentioned, the problem with the government's FBT legislation is that the government has to keep feeding an ever-growing need for spending. In the 1990s alone, this government has run up debt and has run budget deficits of just on $50 billion. That is why in this year's budget there is a figure of some $9.3 billion just to service Commonwealth debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had this government a more responsible fiscal policy, they would not need to put up company tax to lift the WST on cars and start to make it difficult for that industry. They would not have needed to go for the throat of the building industry, which measure luckily was knocked off, to fund the bottom line. They would not have needed to increase taxes had they run budget surpluses when the economy was of a mind to let them do it. We would not now have such a large figure in this budget, such as $9.3 billion, to cover Commonwealth debt. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast bulk of employees that work in the cities&mdash;some 60 per cent of them&mdash;go to work of a morning on commuter transportation systems which are effectively funded by the public purse.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those people who go to work in the country areas outside of Brisbane&mdash;Brisbane is the only place in Queensland that has a commuter system: effectively there is no commuter system outside of Brisbane, and that includes the Gold Coast as well as places like Townsville&mdash;there is a 50 per cent tax levied on their motor vehicle. If a fringe benefits tax is levied as well, the rate will be even more than 50 per cent. When I say that the rate is 50 per cent, I might add that it is made up of a 22 per cent sales tax regime and a 27 per cent tariff regime on top of that, which brings it up to 49 per cent. The electorate that I represent is the third biggest in terms of population in Australia. I represent more people in this House than anyone else, with the exception of three other members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the people I represent, there is absolutely no commuter system. A significant proportion of them get assistance from their employer to get to work of a morning. The mining companies most certainly pay some assistance to their employees. So they pay a fringe benefits tax, the tariff to protect jobs in the cities as well as a sales tax that is not levied upon anyone else to get to work. On top of that we have the petrol tax, which is now 130 per cent. When they go to work of a morning, they pay a tax rate of between 50 per cent and 130 per cent. The people in the cities who go to work of a morning enjoy a subsidy from the government to the tune of 50 per cent. As my own son is aware, the cost of driving 40 kilometres to and from work is quite considerable in a year. The city of Charters Towers, if you like, and the city of Mount Isa, are not only taxed upon that but also bear another cost burden&mdash;the fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on ad infinitum giving anecdotal evidence of how the fringe benefits tax is a totally unacceptable tax to the people in the state of Queensland who live outside Brisbane. When this coalition was in government and attempted to bring in a fringe benefits tax, my own government in Queensland, along with the trade union movement&mdash;which was remarkably silent when this government brought it in&mdash;fought tenaciously against it. I suppose the trade union movement was silent because the tax was levied on the employers. There was unanimity of opinion and unanimity of rejection of that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether or not the employer meets the burden in a well-regulated society, there should not be any excess profits because where there is decent unionism&mdash;not that we have that in Queensland with the likes of the AWU representing about half the work force; it is anything but&mdash;those excess profits are taken by the wage earners. That is not a bad thing; that is a good thing. If there are no excess profits, obviously there must be some pain inflicted here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suddenly Mount Isa Mines is up for another $1 1/2 million for travel allowance alone. The trade union leadership, after a long and protracted fight, won for the workers this wonderful privilege or work practice where the company paid for their entire families to be flown all the way to Brisbane for a holiday and back again. That was a way of overcoming the isolation of the Mount Isa community. It was very much appreciated. The removal of that benefit was substantially the reason behind the worst strike in Queensland in the last 20 or 30 years, which probably goes back to the first Mount Isa strike. The two-week strike at Mount Isa Mines cost the state of Queensland very dearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the precipitating factors was the fringe benefits tax. The company not only had to pay about $5 million&mdash;I cannot remember the figure but it was very large&mdash;to fly all of the families to Brisbane and back again but, on top of that, had to pay a fringe benefits tax of another $1 1/2 million to $2 million. Clearly, it was a very significant item in the Mount Isa budget. When times got tough and cutbacks had to come, that privilege was cut because it was such a large item. There was no doubt in anybody's mind that a very large part of the reason for that sudden cut was the imposition of the fringe benefits tax upon it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every shire in western Queensland, with the exception of Longreach and one other, has lost between 35 per cent and 54 per cent of its population. Towns like Mount Isa have lost 30 per cent in the last four years. Cloncurry has lost 30 per cent in the last seven years. The population of the vast bulk of the continental land mass is galloping away from Australia. One of the forces that is driving them away is the fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain the pernicious influence of this tax and how, when we talk about micro-economic reform or even macro-economic reform, everything out there in the marketplace is being distorted by this warped imposition. We should not be losing this population from Cloncurry and Mount Isa. Mines are opening up there all the time these days. But the mines are being run by people living in Brisbane. They have a thing called the fly-in. If we turn the clock back prior to the imposition of this fringe benefits tax, we find that the Western Australian, Queensland and Northern Territory governments banned fly-ins. I am informed&mdash;although I have not been able to verify it as I have in the other cases&mdash;that the New South Wales government has also banned fly-ins. To take a resource from an area and leave it with absolutely nothing, in return for the exploitation and removal of that resource, creates enormous pressures and hatreds.

It is just a narrow belt around the coastline; if you were to cut around the eastern coastline, along the bottom a little bit and then over to the south west, it would still look like a map of Australia, and you would still have 85 per cent of the continental land mass.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over time there has been a very strong argument that a tax should have been imposed on the provision of non-cash remuneration. The thing has just mushroomed. It is unbelievable how the tentacles have grown like a cancer to the extent today that the Commonwealth raises $2,840 million from fringe benefits tax. I was in the gallery this morning listening to the second reading speech by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). I will quote a few points from it. The Assistant Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will exempt from fringe benefits tax a range of benefits that are primarily used for business purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an interesting admission. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These benefits include employment related protective clothing, briefcases, calculators, electronic diaries, tools of trade, employment related software and portable computers.</PARA>
<PARA>I will guarantee that the majority of people out there in Australia did not realise that a lot of those articles were subject to fringe benefits tax. But the Assistant Treasurer is now exempting those from the act. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mobile car phones will also be exempt where their use is primarily for employment purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>If an employer supplies an employee with a mobile car phone surely it is for use in the business and he is going to get the greatest benefit out it. Before coming into this place I used to run a couple of real estate offices. We had mobile car phones in the cars. Prior to that we had two-way radios. They were there for the prime purpose of operating the business effectively and efficiently&mdash;which they certainly did. The Assistant Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of the safety and health issues involved, taxis provided by employers to employees to travel to and from home between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. will be exempt, as will taxi travel for sick employees to home or to another place of care. The exemption of taxi travel is estimated to cost $45 million.</PARA>
<PARA>If the average punter in the community were to read this speech he would say, `Oh, that is going to cost the business community $45 million.' But that is not correct. What the Assistant Treasurer is saying is that it is costing revenue $45 million; it is $45 million that the Commonwealth will not collect because of these exemptions and changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome these changes as commonsense changes to the fringe benefits tax arrangements that have grown unbelievably over the years. The Assistant Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments in the Bill will also reduce the compliance costs associated with the taxation of car parking benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an unbelievably complicated and convoluted system of assessing a tax liability. The Assistant Treasurer went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, fringe benefits tax will no longer apply to car parking on the employers' premises unless there is a commercial car parking station within a one kilometre radius that charges more than $5 a day at the beginning of the fringe benefits tax year.</PARA>
<PARA>What about Canberra? What about this place? What about the car parking spaces that are provided to ministers, shadow ministers, staffers, the people sitting in the advisers boxes and all the people who work in the building? Are they subject to the fringe benefits tax? Is there a commercial car parking place within a one kilometre radius of this building that charges more than $5 a day?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SU5">Mr VAILE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is no. I ask the Assistant Treasurer: is that equitable compared with the CBD in Sydney? An employer might build premises where he is going to provide employment for 100 people. He puts his application before the local government authority and the first thing the authority does is assess the floor area of the building for car parking requirements. The authority says, `Thou shalt provide so many car parking places for your employees as a requirement of the local government act and ordinances in the state.' That employer has to pay something like $10,000 to $15,000 per car parking space because of the number of employees and customers attending at that building every day. We are going to hit that employer with a fringe benefits tax simply because he has had to provide those car parking spaces if there is a public car parking area within one kilometre that charges more than $5 a day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that these amendments were framed when looking at the CBD areas in Sydney and Melbourne, but they cover the rest of Australia. I suppose in most cases the one kilometre rule should exempt most of those people, but in some cases it will not. There is going to be a need for further amendments to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general public in Australia&mdash;and particularly the small business community&mdash;need not think that the government, in introducing this amending legislation, is going to reduce the amount of money collected by the Commonwealth as a fringe benefits tax. In his second reading speech the Assistant Treasurer, when dealing with the statutory car formula, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to maintain the revenue neutrality of this package of compliance cost reduction measures, the Bill will increase the statutory fractions used in the statutory formula for car benefits by approximately 10 per cent. Even with these increases in the statutory fractions, the statutory formula will remain significantly concessional under a wide range of circumstances. This amendment is estimated to raise $121 million.</PARA>
<PARA>I presume that is $121 million more than appears in this year's budget. It is all about maintaining the revenue neutrality of this piece of legislation&mdash;that is, maintaining in 1995-96 that the Commonwealth will collect $2,840 million fringe benefits tax from the business community in Australia. The areas that this covers are unbelievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), laboured long and hard on the impact of the fringe benefits tax on the living away from home allowance, particularly in remote areas of Australia. It is very important that we pay particular attention to that area of our economy and the remote areas of Australia in which people have to work. I noted in question time on Monday of this week that the Prime Minister crowed long and hard about an international study that indicated every Australian was a millionaire. The study found that we were all worth at least a million dollars because of the asset values of Australia, including the mineral wealth and the agricultural wealth of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the government that we will never ever realise the enormous wealth and potential of the vast and diverse land of ours whilst we continue to put imposts instead of incentives in the way of the people that are trying to develop the regional and remote parts of Australia and the mineral wealth that we have in Australia. They are not recognising by way of incentives how important it is to encourage people to go and work in these parts of Australia, to encourage our Australian companies to develop these parts of Australia. They are not providing incentives under any circumstances, whether it be taxation or otherwise, yet they are providing imposts and impediments by way of taxation measures similar to that of the fringe benefits tax to companies and people that are prepared to invest in remote parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They do not need incentives that are lip-service. They need fair dinkum incentives to get people to live and work in remote areas. It is very important that we recognise that the living away from home allowance that is attracting fringe benefits is a very integral part of the future development of Australia. If we are not prepared to provide these sorts of concessions and if we are not prepared to provide community service obligations through different government instrumentalities&mdash;such as Australia Post, Telecom and air services access for regional airlines into major capital cities in the FAC-run airports&mdash;we will not have anybody living or working in regional and remote Australia. They will all be living up and down the eastern seaboard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they cannot find employment along the eastern seaboard, what will happen? The rest of the community, because of the safety net that we have in place and because of the egalitarian society that we have become, will have to keep those people. The point is that the government can do something about the situation. It is anathema to the Labor government of today to provide those sorts of incentives and concessions which assist and encourage the development of this great nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current position with the living away from home benefit is that it arises when an employee is paid an allowance in the nature of compensation for additional expenses incurred and other disadvantages suffered because the employee is required to live away from home to perform employment duties. It is all part of his job description, his employment package and his duties. The additional expenses include food and accommodation expenses but do not include expenses which the employee could claim as a tax deduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxable value of the living away from home allowance fringe benefit is reduced by the exempt accommodation component and the exempt food component. The current definitions of those terms are complex and uncertain. Where an employee does not receive the living away from home allowance benefit, it will usually be assessed in the hands of the employee. This bill provides that a living away from home allowance fringe benefit will be granted only where the total period for which the employee has lived or is required to live away from his or her home is less than four years for a foreigner or 12 months for an Australian resident. This period begins when the employee begins to live away from home and ends when he or she is no longer required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been argued that the 12-month period for Australian residents posted elsewhere within Australia is too short and the period should be extended to two years. In addition, the distinction between foreign postings and domestic postings raises policy issues as to whether there should be a differential. The CTA has argued that there is no justification for differing treatments of employees required to move within Australia and those who move overseas. One adverse effect is that employers who elect to transfer foreign residents rather than Australian residents will be penalised. The treatment of expatriates visiting Australia is flawed since not all have temporary working visas. The bill also treats benefits paid to employees in remote areas differently from those fly in, fly out arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of changes being made in this piece of legislation. I highlight again for the people of Australia and the parliament that the amount of revenue that the Commonwealth is collecting is not being reduced. I will put it on the record again: it has increased from what was collected in 1986-87, $535 million, to the proposed level in 1995-96 of $2,804 million. On the government's figures, the compliance cost as a percentage of what is collected&mdash;in this bill today we are supposed to be addressing the compliance cost&mdash;runs at 10.6 per cent. So on those figures&mdash;and that is a government statistic&mdash;in 1986-87 the compliance cost for all those people who fell then within the FBT net was $56.7 million. In 1995-96, based on the fact that the government will collect $2,804 million, the compliance cost will be $301 million. That is $301 million worth of impost on business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has been in power in Australia since 1983 and it still has not come to the realisation that it is the private sector that will ultimately provide the employment that is needed to significantly reduce the critical unemployment problem we have in Australia, not massive government spending on different programs. Some of the labour market programs that we are seeing today are an improvement on the labour market programs of 10 years ago, but that does still not recognise the fact that it is the private sector that will provide the fair dinkum and full-time jobs for the unemployed in Australia, not the public sector. Imposing these sorts of taxes will not help this situation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me start with the last point first. The member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), who preceded me, talked about employment and the generation of employment. I will just take him back to the last federal election. This government said then that it would create 500,000 new jobs in this period of government. We still have six months to go and we have created over 670,000. That is not a bad effort I think&mdash;all with this tax in place; and it has been in place for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the tax itself. The member mentioned that in the first year of its operation we collected $535 million. I am told that our estimate at that time was $350 million. You have to remember that when we introduced the fringe benefits tax, we did not know how much income was being delivered in this way. We knew it was being delivered, but we did not know how much. So it is $535 million as against our estimate of $350 million. It just shows that we underestimated the provision of fringe benefits to people in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People talk about the fact that this tax now is raising $2.7 billion. You have to remember, once again, that this&mdash;in most cases&mdash;is an optional tax. Nobody forces somebody to salary package in terms of taking a car. In many cases they can choose to do that or choose to take the money. This is an optional tax. The fact that we are raising $2.7 billion this year means that these benefits are being given and they are being given freely. They are being given instead of a cash payment. That is why the tax is there, of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we introduced a fringe benefits tax, people on substantial incomes paid tax on only a fraction of their income. For example, back in 1985 when we first talked about this tax, workers on about $25,000 or less total cash a year&mdash;as most workers were on about then&mdash;paid tax on all of their income. Yet at the same time somebody with a salary package of $100,000, taking only $30,000 in cash and $70,000 in other forms of income like cars, holidays, low interest loans, school fees, health insurance and all of the other elements that went into a salary package paid tax on only the $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was not fair and that is why this government brought in a fringe benefits tax. We have to remind ourselves, and the House needs reminding too&mdash;some members, a couple of them at least, might not have been here at the time&mdash;of who opposed it. The Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia opposed this tax coming in&mdash;a tax seen as fair in the community. We had to fight them all the way to get this tax in so that people who were salary packaging were having tax paid on 100 per cent of that package rather than just on the cash component. In that way we made the tax system just that much fairer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So with that basis today, I should congratulate the opposition on admitting, after all of this time, that they got it wrong when they opposed the government's fringe benefits tax legislation all those years ago. Now they are saying, `Yes, we'll accept that this tax should be in place and we will not remove it.' Thank goodness for that. It has taken them a long time to come around to that point of view. They opposed it at the start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They always talk about how they are going to make taxation easier for business or ease the compliance costs, which is what this bill is all about. I will get on to their amendments in a few minutes. One would have thought that, if they had any ideas about how they were going to make this tax simpler and fairer, here was the forum. We opened this up to debate by introducing this bill. In effect, we said to the opposition, `If you've got some great ideas, here's your chance to put them. If you believe that our amendments don't go far enough, that our amendments won't simplify the law to the exacting standards that you are talking about outside, then you can move amendments.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments moved do nothing of the sort. In actual fact, the opposition has pulled up short on this one. They are out in the community promising everybody that they are going to ease the compliance costs on the fringe benefits tax and they are talking about watering it down. As the Treasurer (Mr Willis) pointed out in question time yesterday, a National Party resolution talked about abolishing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imagine going back to those bad old days when we taxed only part of a person's income? If the Treasurer's observation was right and the National Party are going to move that the fringe benefits tax be abolished, then that is what we are going to do. We will take a trip back down the time tunnel to where some people paid tax on all of their income and one section of the community, usually the most privileged, paid no tax on a substantial part of their income. It is a nonsense to even think about those things, to even think about going backwards. There are still sections in the coalition who want to go back down that time tunnel to the bad old days, and they are still moving motions in their forums talking about doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we introduced this bill&mdash;and members will remember this&mdash;in the budget before last, the Treasurer announced a review of the compliance costs for fringe benefits tax because we were getting complaints that the compliance costs were too high. Therefore, we set up a process whereby we could investigate these compliance costs. I was given the job, along with two people from the Australian Taxation Office, of going around and talking to a selected number of companies about how we could reduce compliance costs for the fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This occurred after receiving a significant number of written submissions. We picked out of those written submissions a number of representative firms in Sydney and Melbourne and we went to speak with them directly. The sorts of things they brought up are addressed in the bill. In fact, at the time, car parking topped the list. They wanted that streamlined. They came up with a number of proposals on ways in which we should go about that. We have picked up those suggestions, put up by private firms themselves, and incorporated them in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that business has told us is that the record keeping involved for the value of a large number of small fringe benefits was way out of whack. This included benefits like laptops, portable phones and airport lounge membership, et cetera. It really was not worth the compliance costs involved in keeping track of all those things. The government agreed with that. You will notice in the bill before the House today that they have been taken out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area they pointed to was record keeping on meals. We agreed with them on that. There should be simpler ways of recording what FBT should be paid on meals when those meals are given to employees. You will notice in the bill that there are a number of options. The fifty-fifty split was put to us by small business. I still remember one small business person who spoke to us saying that that would be the most equitable way for small business because that is the way that small business operates. It usually operates on a one-to-one basis, and a 50 per cent split was exactly what they were looking for. In the bill today, the 50 per cent split is one option, among others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), in his contribution, complained that the new fifty-fifty rule for entertainment will cost employers more. But, as I said before, that is one of a number of options. He was not on the tour I was on where I spoke to businesses about the ways in which they wanted compliance lowered on the FBT. If he had been, he would know that that is what small business asked for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the amendments that the opposition have moved. I am told that, considering the way that it is drafted, the first one will not work. The words `whichever is the greater' have been left out. Therefore, it is technically deficient. The government will not be agreeing with the others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point again: for all the huffing and puffing and all the posturing around the community about ways in which they will lower compliance costs, this is all the opposition could come up with. They are technically deficient amendments that basically do nothing. There is nothing in here from the opposition that should lead anyone to think that they would significantly improve the government's bill. The amendments just are not there to prove it. When you were given the chance, you pulled up short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that the last speaker, the honourable member for Lyne, and a couple of other speakers have talked about the fact that this is a revenue neutral package. That is right. There was a very generous concession on cars. The way that the government has clawed back the concessions given through the package is to increase the amount paid on cars given to employees. An article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly </EMPHASIS>last year showed that this concession was so concessional that in many cases firms were giving two cars to employees&mdash;one for the employee and one for his wife. It was in the article. This is how concessional it was. We make no apologies for lifting that rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the budgetary situation, a revenue neutral outcome is what the government desired. We have done it in a way which eases compliance costs and protects revenue, particularly in a year in which we are trying to maintain a surplus because of other considerations in the economy. It is all very important that this happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition should always be reminded that, had they won the last election, the consumption tax they were going to impose on Australia would have been on top of the fringe benefits tax. It would add layers of complexity to the tax law to have a consumption tax sitting on top of a fringe benefits tax. You can imagine the sigh of relief that went around the business community in terms of compliance costs on fringe benefits when that one hit the fence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just wind up my contribution by answering some questions raised by other opposition speakers. A number of them have said that the living away from home allowance changes will increase compliance costs instead of reducing them. In fact, the changes will do what people have actually asked us to do during the FBT review&mdash;we received many submissions on this&mdash;and that is to clarify when an allowance qualifies as a living away from home allowance. Another member said that there is no taxation impact statement with the bill and he asked: where is it? There is a compliance cost impact statement for every measure proposed by the bill.

Does the assistant minister stand by previous claims in the House that enforceable compulsory unionism does not exist in Australia? If the minister does stand by those claims, what action will he take to rectify the injustice done only last month at the TNT depot in my electorate to Mr Grant Parker, a self-employed truck driver? Is it illegal for a Transport Workers Union official to demand $180 in union fees from Mr Parker which he had to pay before his truck was unloaded?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I might say at the outset that one of the government's great achievements has been what it has been able to get for the higher education sector. In case there is any doubt about it, I should quote what Professor Alan Gilbert, the vice-chancellor of the Tasmanian University and soon to become vice-chancellor of Melbourne University, had to say last Friday at a function attended by the member for Braddon:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure that when the history is written accurately one of the main things said about the government that has been in power since 1983 is that it has done more for education and for higher education I think than any government in Australia's history.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only is that an accurate statement but also in the last budget we did even more for higher education. We increased the number of new places by 5,850 which, when you take the pipeline effect, means 11,000 new places over the course of the next 3 1/2 to four years. We also increased research funding in the order of $150 million over three years. It was a package that at the time was applauded by the vice-chancellors, the academics and the student bodies. But it is a package that is now under threat because of the continuing vandalism of the opposition in the Senate in relation to budget measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the opposition came out with yesterday was a commitment to blocking two important measures in the government's higher education package. The first measure introduced intermediate thresholds for HECS students, with not even a $1 increase in any debt to HECS students&mdash;only thresholds by which the money can be recovered; so there was no increase to students&mdash;and our second measure required people who had not taken out citizenship after being in the country for three years to pay HECS up-front. I might say that this decision in terms of non-citizens versus Australian citizens is a direction that the US and UK governments are now pursuing. But not the opposition; they have to be the spoilers as always.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The effect of these two measures being blocked by the opposition is to cost higher education $20 million per year. That is, 2,000 places in universities are now in jeopardy because of the inane position that has been adopted by the opposition and is being pursued in another place. It was a position arrived at through no consultation with the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, none with the academics and none with the students. It is policy developed and based on pure opportunism, but it is actually policy at its very worst.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me point out what the consequences of this are. The states that got the growth places were Queensland, which got the bulk of them, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania. The concern of Victoria and South Australia is that they would lose places to give the increases in these other states. They did not, as a result of our package. I would like to know whether the member for La Trobe, for example, who has often expressed concern about places for Monash University, whether the member for Adelaide, who has also been concerned about the possibility of places being lost in Adelaide, and whether the member for Braddon, who got growth places the other day in terms of the northern part of Tasmania, were consulted that the implications of this policy position would cost those universities places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact of the matter is, we cannot put the package together if the $20 million is denied us. Those members really have to search very long and hard about how they respond to the universities when the universities come to them and say, `How are we going to be able to secure or retain these places?' The simple fact of the matter is that your strategy is being run by dopes. Whether they consult you or not, I do not know. So far as the Western Australians are concerned, there is no-one on that side of the House to consult because they are all moving across to the cross benches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very perverse situation when the opposition says that it will support and protect non-citizens but do it at the expense of Australian students, particularly our young people. What about the people who were around on the youth bus last week? Did you tell them you were going to adopt a policy that meant you would look after people who had not taken out citizenship but it would cost them places in universities? I am sure they would be very interested to find out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the Leader of the Opposition takes a bit more notice as to what his shadow spokesman for education is doing in the other house, understands the implication of what they are blocking in that place and realises that it is costing students places in universities. They will come from Victoria and they will come from South Australia. It is members associated with those states who ought to get on board, understand the implications of Senator Robert Hill's stupidity and get him to change tack.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I remind the minister that in the last year there has been no decline whatever in the rate of teenage unemployment, which remains at 28 per cent&mdash;32.5 per cent in the Bendigo region&mdash;and that the rate of unemployment among teenage males has increased. Will the minister explain the complete failure of Working Nation to provide effective assistance to unemployed teenagers?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1329" SPEAKER="Crean The Hon S.F." NAMEID="DT4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HOTHAM" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do accept the fact that there is still a major problem associated with youth unemployment. It is unacceptably high, and it is something that was particularly focused upon through the Working Nation strategies. For example, the youth training initiative that was introduced under Working Nation&mdash;it did not exist before Working Nation came into effect&mdash;ensures, through case management and commitment to the job compact, a job offer for anyone who has been out of work for 18 months or longer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that we also have a significant structural shift in teenage unemployment. When you and I were at school, our ability to get jobs was legion in the marketplace, essentially because many unskilled jobs were available. The fact is that those jobs do not exist today. They do not exist in the banks as they used to. Technology has seen to that. But the same principle still applies. We have to find the start for young people, and the start these days increasingly is not built around an unskilled job but one that involves a level of skills. That is why the emphasis on the part of this government has been to lift those skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that 84 per cent of people who go through a traineeship get a job, and they are still in the job 12 months after the traineeship has concluded. The other simple reality is that your chances of becoming unemployed are twice as high if you do not have a year 12 qualification. They are very stark statistics, and that is why the emphasis of this government has been on lifting schooling and lifting training in schooling that is relevant. It is a commitment for the whole nation to get to 95 per cent of school children completing year 12.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is happening. In fact, it is over 80 per cent now, and it has gone up from 36 per cent since 1983. If you say that an increase from 36 per cent to 80 per cent is nothing happening, you have got a very strange view of the facts. The commitment is to get to 95 per cent, an objective that all governments share.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the point of view of the government, we do have to go further so far as the youth of this country are concerned. We have to make the pathways in school much more relevant. That is why we funded the Student Traineeship Foundation&mdash;because states were dragging their feet. We are directly funding a program that should be the province of the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have gone further than that. In the last week I have also said that we will develop programs by which we link that training to a real job. We will offer people who have completed that training a guaranteed job for 12 months after they have completed it, and that is in train. The other thing that I believe we have to do is to recognise that the start we are giving people through the various labour market programs goes on and links to a traineeship and a job. That is also something that we will be developing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My commitment is to develop those guarantees for young people. We have an obligation to ensure that the young people of this country get an opportunity to work, that we tap their talents and that we tap their creativity. But the structures as they existed before did not do it. Apprenticeships were effectively the only traineeship. We have now developed traineeships that cover a whole gamut of operations&mdash;in the environment, sport, arts and entertainment, telecommunications, information technology. None of these things existed before Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation was not just a one-year commitment; it was a four-year commitment. It is a commitment that is funded. The message that we have been getting across in the last few months is that there is a new deal and a new opportunity for the young people in this country, but it will be secured only if that program is given the opportunity to run the full four years. Under us it will, but under you it would be decimated.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I have seen those press reports; in fact, I was reading them not long ago. They relate to the protests in Strasbourg by members of the European Parliament against French nuclear testing. If I were as immodest as the member for Mayo, I might be tempted to claim some credit on behalf of the all-party delegation&mdash;including the member for Mayo, the right honourable member for New England, Senator Vicki Bourne and the member for Moreton&mdash;which was recently in Europe to protest to various countries in Europe and to raise the profile of Australia's objections to French nuclear testing in a number of European capitals. In the course of that we saw a number of ministers, we saw a great number of European members of parliament, and we gave plenty of interviews to the European media about Australia's stance. I welcome the stand which was taken overnight by members of the European Parliament. I am sure that all members in this place wish them well in their efforts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For our part, the Australian government has been absolutely tireless in its opposition to nuclear testing and will continue to be active on a range of fronts to encourage a sustained international response to the French nuclear testing, as well as, of course, the nuclear testing being conducted by China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I accompanied the Prime Minister to Madang for the 26th meeting of the South Pacific Forum. Members will know that the forum itself has been a source, and a consistent opponent, of nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Indeed, one of the main reasons the forum was established in 1971 was to oppose French nuclear testing. At the Madang meeting, the forum leaders issued a declaration which expressed in very trenchant terms the region's opposition to nuclear testing. `Extreme outrage' were the words that they used to describe their view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also had the opportunity to convey directly their views to a French government minister during the post-forum dialogue meeting. At that meeting France for the first time was represented by a cabinet-level minister, Mr Jacques Godfrain, who is Minister for Cooperation in the French government. The dialogue session with the French lasted for over two hours. It was a frank, robust exchange which included ministers from PNG, the Marshall Islands&mdash;which, of course, has itself been a victim of nuclear testing in the past&mdash;the Solomon Islands and Western Samoa, as well as Australia. The French side explained at length why they were going through with the testing program. They offered to open the testing site to the region following the conclusion of the tests as a scientific research facility. From our side, we made the point fervently that what we wanted to do was stop the tests, not to talk about what might happen after them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What effect, apart from the Strasbourg debate to which the honourable member refers, has all this been having? Some other dialogue partners told the forum that the actions of the South Pacific nations, small as those nations are, were having a real impact globally, including on the French government, and I think we are all familiar with public opinion in France now on this matter. So I believe that the actions of the government are having an effect on the global stage which is out of all proportion to our place in the South Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the coming weeks the government will intensify its efforts, something which the delegation pursued in Europe, to obtain a United Nations resolution which calls for an end to all testing. As well as that, the President of the Senate will shortly lead a delegation to the European institutions which, among other things, will follow up the work of our delegation earlier this month, and seek to draw attention to the views held throughout Australia and the South Pacific, and more widely, about this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that I thank the members of the delegation to Europe. I believe that we worked together very well. I pay particular tribute to the member for Chifley, who asked this question, because he took over the leadership of that delegation after I was obliged to return home. I do not want to be partisan about this. I think all members of the delegation did an excellent job and I thank them for their efforts.</PARA>

Honourable members would be well aware of the significant improvements that have been made over the last few years in assistance for families which now, in terms of direct assistance alone, amount to over $12 billion a year. Honourable members would also be aware of the enhancements that this government has provided: for example, the 100 per cent real increase in additional family payments directed to low income families with children up to the age of 13; the 150 per cent real increase during the term of this government for children aged 13 to 15 of low income families; the introduction of the parenting allowance which means an increase of up to $217 per fortnight for low income families with one partner who is actually in the work force; and the maternity allowance which is now $840 and which is to commence from February next year. These and other changes have been introduced to improve the flexibility, responsiveness and simplicity of the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I have pleasure in announcing that the government has determined the sites of the first 15 pilot family service centres. The concept of the family service centres is to provide an integrated centre, either in shopfronts or in Department of Social Security offices, where families will be able to get a comprehensive suite of advice and assistance on family payments and related matters. It will include payments made by the Department of Social Security. It will include child-care assistance and the provision of advice and services in a range of other areas. It will provide referral to services provided by agencies in other tiers of government. In other words, it will be a comprehensive integrated service for families.</PARA>

These 15 pilot centres are the first in the establishment of a comprehensive network of such centres. In a number of locations we will be trying out variants on the basic concept to try and identify the one that is most effective and useful.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I think we should be clear when discussing national curriculum statements and profiles about the terms and their history. The profiles describe the progression of learning during the compulsory years in eight key learning areas. They provide lists of outcome statements which a typical student would be expected to achieve at different levels. They do not, as many people continue to believe, prescribe curriculum content to achieve those outcomes. Under the national approach, curriculum remains&mdash;as it always has&mdash;in the hands of the states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us also be clear about the history of the way in which the national curriculum statements and profiles were developed. They are primarily a states' agenda, arising out of the 1989 Hobart declaration on the common goals of schooling. This is not an exclusive Commonwealth agenda. They were developed as a result of the states' declaration in 1989 with Commonwealth assistance. They were not devised by Commonwealth bureaucrats. The work was done in their development by the curriculum and assessment committee of the then AEC, the Australian Education Council, under the chairmanship of Dr Ken Boston, who was then and is still the New South Wales Director-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clearly appropriate in the case of New South Wales for a new government to take stock of curriculum within that state. That is entirely consistent with the decision of all ministers at the ministerial council meeting in December 1993, and that was that states are entitled to proceed according to their own timetables and their own priorities. In the wake of the Eltis report in New South Wales, I have advice from the New South Wales minister's office that the decision of the Eltis committee, responded to by the New South Wales minister, is that they are able to proceed in that state within the framework of the national curriculum statements and profiles; that the supporting documents which the Eltis committee recommends to support curriculum in that state are entirely consistent with an outcomes approach. So the Commonwealth is quite satisfied with the approach that was taken in New South Wales. The dissatisfaction in that state was mainly concerned with a cumbersome English syllabus which was devised under the leadership of the previous government in that state.</PARA>

I suppose that takes us back to that fully imported lorry that you have running around outside with the bunch of fabrications that you have turning over on that little wheel to have us believe that that represents your policy. The simple fact of the matter is that, insofar as the consequences of that foreign debt can be sensibly addressed, there is only one policy in play in the Australian electorate, in the Australian community, that deals with that and it deals with it thoroughly. That is the propositions that we have put forward to improve private saving in this country which will secure a level of performance that ought to, over time, put an end to the unacceptable level of dependency that we have on foreign investment in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a policy that you oppose, I am afraid to say. Yet the implications of it for the farming community, the implications of it over the long term for interest rates, the implications of it for investment in industries related to the farming community in this country are very substantial. You could do no better service for your constituents and the ones that you have quite understandably referred to, than to start to change the policies of your party towards that. Give people a decent retirement, give people a decent opportunity to save associated with that and lower our level of dependence on foreign debt as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when it comes to servicing that foreign debt, over the last five years the ratio of our exports that has gone to servicing that has approximately halved, which is a very good outcome indeed because of, among other things, that interest rate regime that you referred to.</PARA>

And, as far as he was concerned, when he had a few things to say a bit earlier on to the show up in Nyngan, where again on rural policies, particularly drought policies, he said he did not think anything more than rather minor adjustments were required as far as government policy was concerned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Charlton, a former chairman of the Parliamentary Labor Party, for his question. I did hear what Mr Kennett had to say in his speech on 22 August about the quality of Commonwealth public servants. Mr Kennett, at that time, also said that he had had discussions that morning, and previously, with the Leader of the Opposition about a new direction for Victoria and for Australia. Mr Kennett at the time complained that the roles of the Commonwealth and the states had become too closely entwined in `areas which should be the domain of the states, especially in services like health, education, welfare and housing'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What can parents, teachers and young people expect from the coalition's new direction for education? The answer lies in what the Kennett government has already done for schools in Victoria. It has closed nearly 300 schools and reduced the number of teachers by 8,000. In its most recent budget, Victoria has, once again, reduced its own contribution to school education. Spending on government schools in Victoria has been maintained thanks only to the Commonwealth's payments, which have grown in real terms. Victorian government spending on non-government schools has been cut by a massive 8.1 per cent, even though the number of students attending those schools has actually increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the numbers would go up if nearly 300 government schools have been closed. But I would have thought that the savings from closing schools would at least provide some support for schools that have to pick up those students that have been displaced by closure. But apparently that is not the Liberal way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal government of South Australia is also slashing education spending. It slashed $40 million from education in its most recent budget. In South Australia, state government support for non-governmental schools fell at the same time as those schools were getting increased enrolments. In South Australia, that support to the non-government sector fell by 16 per cent. Quite simply, without the Commonwealth's growing level of support, schools in Victoria and South Australia would be much worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While those state Liberal governments are reducing their support for school education, Commonwealth expenditure on schools has increased since 1982 by 55 per cent in real terms. The Kennett-Howard proposition, which would hand to the state governments the control of school funding, would be an error of tragic proportions. It would expose Australian children to the Kennett style policies of selling off school sites for short-term gain while impairing the education opportunities of three million Australian students. The effects of that would be felt right throughout the community and the work force long after the cheques from those sales had been spent. Nobody in the Liberal Party, from the Leader of the Opposition down, it seems, is capable of understanding the importance of school education and the utter foolishness of selling off our young people's futures.</PARA>

That is why the special intervention program, which is worth millions of dollars more than was ever available in the JPET program, is available for that very purpose. Through case management and the special intervention program, there is the ability not only to manage people while we have got them in the compact group but also to develop post-program mentoring, follow-up and support for them. That does not exist for other people who are unemployed.</PARA>

These are the initiatives that do have to be developed. I think you have missed the boat, because we are already doing it up in your electorate based on the discussions I had with groups up there recently. I would suggest that, rather than knocking that proposal, you actually get behind it and support it.</PARA>

When asked to specify where you in government would find the cuts, the only program that he has mentioned has been Working Nation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I can inform the House of the work carried out by the awards management branch. I recently received some figures on its work. In 1994-95, awards officers received some 4,000 complaints and completed 3,890 inspections covering over 77,000 employees. They detected over 2,100 employers who breached awards. They covered such matters as underpayment of wages, incorrect payment of overtime or penalty rates and breaches of conditions or classification arrangements. As a result of their good work, employers paid over $3 1/2 million to employees to rectify those award breaches. During the same period, awards officers received over 300,000 inquiries about awards matters. In addition to that, people should understand that the work of the awards management branch is aided and assisted by those other players in the game, namely, employer representatives, who make employers aware of awards, and union representatives, who also help employees and employers become aware of their obligations under the award system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What troubles us greatly is that there is a coalition government in Western Australia which seems to have the support of the coalition federally to wipe out the ability of trade unions, amongst others, to police awards. So much so that, for instance, Mr Keirath, the industrial relations minister in Western Australia, sought to bring before that parliament the following sorts of penalties: they wanted to penalise unions which attempted to switch to the federal system to escape a bastardised program that they want to establish in Western Australia. They also wanted to suspend the pay of union officials when union members went on strike. So much for the notion of freedom of association which the member for Adelaide asked me about earlier. Still on the table are significant concerns that we have and that the coalition ought to have about the treatment of those people who make the system honest, who make the system run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following matters are still on the table in Western Australia: postal strike ballots becoming a legal requirement even in the case of a refusal to work for health and safety reasons. So if you are in a dangerous workplace you cannot stop work; you have to have a secret ballot before you can agree to get out of what may be a dangerous workplace. There are restrictions on the union's right of entry to an employer's premises, inhibiting award enforcement and the possibility of recruitment. Fundamental here is the question of the freedom of association&mdash;the right of a union to support its membership when it is getting dudded by employers. I hope that the coalition will own up to these views about anti-freedom of association that they seem to carry and the fundamental role of having a number of people policing awards, policing the system, to ensure there is fair payment and treatment of workers under the industrial relations system.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V5">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance today is the need to ensure that Commonwealth funds for local authorities are appropriately expended at the local level. This is a matter of great importance to the Commonwealth revenue. If one has a look at the financial assistance grants that have been made to local authorities over the last 10 or so years, one finds that in 1983-84, for example, over $460 million was allocated by way of financial assistance grants to local authorities. In the course of the five- and 10-yearly periods since then in the financial year 1988-89 that amount rose to $652 million, in 1993-94 to $1.05 billion, and in the current financial year to $1.15 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the allocations by way of financial assistance grants in my own state following those same financial year periods, in 1983-84 it was over $43 million, in 1988-89 over $59 million, in 1993-94 over $120 million, and in the current financial year $131 million. This does not include any special allocations of Commonwealth revenue to local authorities to be made under special programs&mdash;for example, the local government development program. If we look at the same period, from 1983-84 through to 1994-95, we find allocations anywhere from $2 million to $5 million variously to local authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that these funds are disbursed and appropriated well at the local level. Let us look at some of the funds that have been allocated to particular local authorities in Western Australia. At random I pick a particular local authority in Western Australia. It is not a local authority which is even in my electorate. The city of Wanneroo in the financial year 1983-84 received by way of general purpose grants over $1.5 million from the Commonwealth in the financial year 1988-89, over $2.2 million by way of funds from the Commonwealth in the financial year 1993-94, over $2.26 million by way of general purpose grants, and over $119 million by way of road funding. In the current financial year it received over $2.6 million by way of general purpose grants and $1.5 million by way of road funding. So the city of Wanneroo in the current financial year by way of general purpose and road funding receives over $4 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to make sure that these funds are appropriately allocated. I was particularly concerned at a matter raised yesterday in the House by the Independent member for Moore (Mr Filing)&mdash;one of the Liberal members from Western Australia who has been unfairly dismissed by the Liberal Party, and who has not been protected by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) from elements of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. Mr Filing yesterday asked the Minister for Finance and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) about remarks that the Deputy Prime Minister had made. Mr Filing referred to so-called federal interests in the matter surrounding corrupt behaviour by gaoled former Wanneroo mayor Dr Wayne Bradshaw and others. My constituents who live in the city of Wanneroo want to know what are these so-called federal interests. The Minister for Finance and Deputy Prime Minister responded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Actually, Paul, I was after your antagonists.</PARA>
<PARA>It is well known that elements of the city of Wanneroo are involved and were involved and instrumental in ensuring that the member for Moore, Mr Filing, lost his pre-selection. In the course of his answer, the Deputy Prime Minister made it clear that the federal interest in this matter is that up to 50 per cent of local authority funds are provided by the Commonwealth. The minister also made the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last time I looked, too, as far as the taxation act was concerned, proceeds from bribery were still subject to taxation. That would also be a matter of some interest so far as the federal government is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Finance went on to make the point that the city of Wanneroo is notorious for corrupt activity and that it is incumbent upon the state government, upon Premier Court, to ensure that a proper inquiry is constituted into the conduct of the city of Wanneroo and into the conduct of people who have been found either in the Kyle report or by the courts as being engaged in corrupt and improper activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This parliament needs to be confident that funds at the local level which are allocated by Commonwealth to local authorities are properly expended. I have gone through the vast array of funds which are applied and the over $4 million which the city of Wanneroo has received in this financial year. There has been longstanding concern about the city of Wanneroo. In 1992 the then Premier of Western Australia, Dr Carmen Lawrence, established an inquiry known as the Kyle inquiry to look at corruption in the city of Wanneroo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go through the report at length. It is a weighty tome which exposes corruption in the city of Wanneroo and exposes the links that the Liberal Party has with that corruption in Western Australia. The report contains some very interesting findings by Mr Kyle. Some of the basic issues which are established in the Kyle report include evidence of official corruption in the Wanneroo City Council. Mr Kyle made three specific findings of official corruption involving Dr Wayne Bradshaw. Some of these findings have been confirmed by the outcome of criminal proceedings against a councillor of the city of Wanneroo, Councillor David King. Dr Wayne Bradshaw was also recently convicted of a number of corrupt actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kyle report, on Mr Kyle's own admission, is inadequate because he was unable to interview or speak to Dr Wayne Bradshaw who had absconded overseas. What is also clear from Mr Kyle's report is that there are clear links between the Liberal Party in Western Australia and the city of Wanneroo. There are several threads in this report which implicate sitting Liberal members in the Western Australian parliament and the Liberal Party's general structure in the northern suburbs in cases of official corruption. Yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister made clear that Mr Kyle is a member of the Liberal Party and is held in some impartial and objective regard. In chapter 5 of his report Mr Kyle had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between 1986 and 1990 there is little doubt that Bradshaw formed and led a faction that operated as such and whose attitudes were largely dictated by Bradshaw. Largely this group consisted of active Liberal Party people&mdash;members of the Moore division of the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the same people who cut the throat of the member for Moore by withdrawing his endorsement, despite weak help from the Leader of the Opposition for the member for Moore to retain his Liberal Party preselection. Mr Kyle found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Largely this group consisted of active Liberal Party people&mdash;members of the Moore division of the Liberal Party. . . the prominence of Liberal Party people on the Council, and Councillors within the Liberal Party organisation itself, and the high profile gained by those people, resulted in some of them being preselected as candidates for the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, was a reference to the 1993 state election. In chapter 5 Mr Kyle goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present controlling faction is significantly motivated by party political considerations. Most of the faction are active Liberal Party members and three of them, Mayor Johnson and Councillors Smith and Carstairs, are candidates for the Liberal Party at the next State election.</PARA>
<PARA>Johnson and Smith were successful and are now members of the Western Australian parliament. Kyle goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their election expenses were often paid for by Bradshaw. Indeed it was hard to distinguish between the campaign helpers of some candidates for the Council and members of the local Liberal Party organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>There we see the web of deceit and corruption that surrounds the city of Wanneroo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of people have called for a full and proper judicial inquiry. As I have indicated, Mr Kyle himself has pointed out the inadequacies of his own inquiry because of his inability to speak to Bradshaw. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of Friday, 1 September 1995, under the heading `Doctor guilty, but the malady lingers' there is an article by Tony Barrass. Mr Barrass, described as a person `who has been following the Wanneroo Inc. saga for five years, reports that there are still many unanswered questions about the issue which demand an official investigation'. Mr Barrass talks about political commentators and he writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They argue that the position of attorney-general&mdash;the State's top law enforcement officer&mdash;has been compromised many times. . . by her past association with Bradshaw. They claim her position, more than any other apart from the Premier's, must be beyond reproach.</PARA>
<PARA>It is well known that the husband of the Attorney-General, Colin Edwardes, was a councillor of the city of Wanneroo at the appropriate time and is the subject of adverse findings by Kyle in his report. Indeed, Mr Barrass reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Kyle inquiry into the business affairs of Wanneroo council, in the chapter headed Intimidation, said, `The inquiry concludes that Wayde Smith and Colin Edwardes made their allegations to the inquiry at least in part for party political reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wayde Smith was a candidate for the liberal seat of Wanneroo.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The inquiry does not accept Edwardes' evidence. . . and concludes that Edwardes and Wayde Smith saw an opportunity to make allegations of a very serious nature involving. . . Mrs Watkins'.</PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Watkins was a Labor member of parliament. In the course of the article Barrass also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Smith lied about his business dealings with Bradshaw not long after a listening device was found in his former house.</PARA>
<PARA>He concludes his article by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been plenty of inquiries into Wanneroo Inc, but not one of them so far has got to the bottom of the many allegations. And many suspect that there's a handful of people in State Parliament who hope that's the way things will stay.</PARA>
<PARA>Where has the Premier of Western Australia been in all of this? The answer is that he has been nowhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premier of Western Australia came to office on promises of full accountability in government. Since that point in time we have seen his failure or refusal to implement the recommendations of the WA Inc. royal commission; his failure or refusal to take appropriate steps to enact legislation with respect to disclosure of donations; his failure or refusal to implement accountability measures particularly in respect of freedom of information; and his failure or refusal to make any commitment so far as the Commission on Government's report is concerned&mdash;which the Labor Party in Western Australia has committed itself to implementing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 August 1994 in the state parliament the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is any evidence of wrongdoing by any member of this side of the House I will be the first to take action. If there is wrongdoing I will be the first to act.</PARA>
<PARA>The Premier of Western Australia needs to act in this matter by immediately instituting a proper inquiry into these allegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are views which are held by Mr Court's deputy. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> yesterday by Colleen Egan&mdash;a journalist who is well known to members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia&mdash;there is a reference to Mr Cowan, the leader of the National Party and Deputy Premier of Western Australia. Mr Cowan made the point that Premier Court, having instituted a royal commission into the Easton matter purely for political purposes and to damage the federal Minister for Health, now has in front of him convictions, Kyle's findings on corruption, links with the Liberal Party, and links with those matters going to the Attorney-General and members of the Western Australian parliament. When matters which might properly be the subject of judicial inquiry or royal commission fall into focus, Mr Court will not act. Why? Because he seeks to cover up any activity which might adversely reflect on the Liberal Party in Western Australia!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see what some of those things are. We can take a cursory glance at editions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian </EMPHASIS>newspaper in the last couple of years and we can see precisely why there has to be an independent, impartial, full and proper inquiry into these matters. The first headline reads, `Liberal MLA hit by police raids'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States self-proclaimed crusader against organised crime, Wanneroo MLA Wayde Smith, had his home and electoral office raided by fraud squad detectives yesterday. . . They seized documents. . . it is believed police have been examining the Kyle report on the dealings of the Wanneroo council and are investigating Mr Smith's links with former Wanneroo mayor Wayne Bradshaw.</PARA>
<PARA>From another cursory glance at the newspapers we see the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> which reads `Lib MP's account probed'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Police are investigating the possibility that allegedly corrupt payments to former Wanneroo mayor Wayne Bradshaw were cashed through bank accounts controlled by Liberal MLA Wayde Smith.</PARA>
<PARA>In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> again we have the headline `Edwardes, Bradshaw bugged'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attorney-General Cheryl Edwardes was secretly taped by a police undercover team during confidential discussions with former Wanneroo mayor Dr Wayne Bradshaw. . . the conversation was recorded during a legally sanctioned bugging operation in 1990 as part of police investigations into alleged corruption at the Wanneroo City Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former CIB detective and Wanneroo councillor Wayde Smith, now a Liberal backbencher, had his Ocean Reef home bugged in the same undercover operation.</PARA>
<PARA>Still the Premier of Western Australia refuses to act. Why? Because we know that the Attorney-General of Western Australia, Cheryl Edwardes, was instrumental in rounding up the numbers when Richard Court knocked over Barry McKinnon as leader of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few more vignettes. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 7 June 1994 we have the headline `Edwardes "got donations"'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wanted doctor Wayne Bradshaw claims Attorney-General Cheryl Edwardes got $30,000 in political donations, some of which was condemned in a government inquiry on corruption.</PARA>
<PARA>The government inquiry, of course, was the Kyle report. At about the same time the heading `WA's Attorney-General pressed to stand aside' appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. That article read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Western Australia's Attorney-General, Mrs Cheryl Edwardes, was being pressed last night to stand aside following allegations that she misled Parliament over the funding of her 1989 election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Edwardes has told Parliament. . . that she received only $2,000 and the use of a facsimile machine from a friend, Dr Wayne Bradshaw, a former Mayor of Wanneroo who is now practising in the Maldive Islands.</PARA>
<PARA>He subsequently came back. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Dr Bradshaw told Channel Nine News in Perth. . . that he had funded `at least' $30,000 of Mrs Edwardes's campaign expenses.</PARA>
<PARA>We find numerous expressions of interest and views indicating that these matters should be the subject of an inquiry. I notice that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wanneroo Times</EMPHASIS> carries the headline `MPs are split on inquiry'. The article indicates that, whilst the independent member for Moore, Mr Filing, is in favour of an inquiry, the member for Cowan, Mr Richard Evans, who has been placed on probation by way of his preselection in respect of these same people, was unavailable for comment. We know where he stands in respect of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a conclusive, comprehensive case. We have impropriety and convictions for bribery and corruption in a city which is funded by the Commonwealth. There is clear evidence that the Premier of Western Australia needs to take action to stamp out this corruption at the local level. However, he refuses to act. This is the person who came to office pledging accountability in government. He refuses to implement the recommendations of the WA Inc. royal commission; he refuses to implement COG's recommendations; and he will not call an inquiry into the city of Wanneroo where there is clearly corruption and bribery. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before question time, when this debate was interrupted, I was speaking to the circulated amendment which the coalition is moving in relation to car parking benefits under the fringe benefits tax legislation. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said, in his concluding remarks to the second reading speech, that he was, in effect, inviting the coalition to come in here and move any amendments which they like that would improve this legislation. When we do come in here and move some amendments to improve this legislation, we find the government saying, `No, we are not going to accept these amendments.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of the amendments themselves indicate quite clearly that this government is not concerned about really reducing the compliance costs on small business so far as the fringe benefits tax is concerned; it is really interested in raising revenue. Take the amendments which we are dealing with at the present time. One of them deals with the statutory number of days; that is, the number of days set out in the fringe benefits tax legislation to which the car parking conditions will apply. This legislation proposes that there be 240 days to which fringe benefits tax would become payable if the car parking provisions are actually in operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you take the number of days in the financial year&mdash;365&mdash;and you take away the number of weekends for which you would expect that the cars would not be parked in such car parking places, you will find that that brings the number down to 261. If you then take away the average number of public holidays around Australia&mdash;namely, 11&mdash;and annual holidays of four weeks, which is another 20 days, and if you add two days very conservatively estimated for sick leave, you are reduced to 228 days for which fringe benefits tax ought to be payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what does this legislation provide? It provides for 240 days. The government is saying to small business operators that it is going to charge fringe benefits tax on a total of 240 days rather than 220 days, when you would expect that the business might actually be making use of the car parking provisions. The government is, in effect, ripping an extra 12 days of the year off small business in relation to this provision alone. They come in here and say that they are interested in reducing compliance costs. This is, quite simply, another revenue grab by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have also proposed in this amendment is that the $5 figure for parking ought to be indexed. The government obviously is not going to accept this amendment; the Assistant Treasurer has said that he will not do that. So what we have is car parking provisions in areas which may not be subject to fringe benefits tax requirements at the present time. But,  without any indexation of that $5, over time that will become subject to FBT. Again, the failure to index the figure of $5 is another example of revenue being raised by bracket creep. Many small businesses at present exempt from this FBT requirement will in future years find themselves caught by it and paying the fringe benefits tax when we are told that this is about reducing compliance. The reality in these two examples alone is that this is about increasing the revenue to the Commonwealth. Very little of it is about an actual reduction in compliance costs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I was making previously was that the opposition are going around telling businesses about how they are going to slash compliance costs; how compliance costs on FBT are going to drop dramatically under them&mdash;and also capital gains tax. Let us just have a look at fringe benefits tax today. Here is the opposition's opportunity to show the business community how they would slash compliance costs on fringe benefits tax; in fact, the best opportunity you will get prior to the election to show us the colour of your money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what do we get? We get an amendment about indexation, which is poorly drafted and will not do the job it was designed to do. So of course we are not going to accept that. They bring up another amendment as an alternative to the 240 days. Anybody who has been in business would know that, when people go on holidays, the spot that is vacated is usually taken up by another employee. You have a certain number of parking spots and, of course, they are usually full during the year. There is nothing wrong with the 240 days that we have actually come up with. The other point is that there are other alternatives. This is a statutory formula which you can choose. If you are disadvantaged by this, then you can go to the 12-week rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these amendments that are being put up by the opposition do nothing to lower compliance costs. Yet those opposite are going out to the community saying, `Look, elect us and the compliance costs on fringe benefits tax will drop dramatically.' What they have done? They have squibbed it. Those opposite should not be believed. On their own performance here today, when they had a chance to put up amendments on a bill that is introduced into the parliament to lower compliance costs on fringe benefits tax, what do they give us? Amendments about indexation and changing the statutory number of days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is that all there is in the Liberal Party cupboard in terms of lowering compliance costs on fringe benefits tax? If it is, they have got nothing. When they go out to businesses and say, `We're going to lower compliance costs on fringe benefits tax,' we will remind businesses that, when they had the chance, they did nothing about it. They put up a couple of amendments, one of which is so poorly drafted that it will not work and the other just does not take account of reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in the end what we have got from the opposition once again is nothing&mdash;nothing on policy and nothing but rhetoric to the business community. When given the opportunity to put up their grand scheme for lowering compliance costs on fringe benefits tax, their cupboard is bare. I say to the business community: when you get Liberals out there saying, `Just vote for us and fringe benefits tax compliance costs will go down,' they just should not be believed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"(b) commences between 7.00 p.m. and 7.00 a.m.".</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment relates to taxi travel provided to employees. The proposal in this legislation is that an exemption will be made available for taxi travel between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. justified on the basis of health and safety reasons. Taxi travel provided to employees may qualify as an expense fringe benefit or as a residual fringe benefit. However, the provision of transport by an employer for an employee between home and work may be an exempt benefit if it qualifies as an exempt minor benefit. A benefit is an exempt minor benefit where the benefit provided is small, and similar benefits are provided irregularly or infrequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill proposes to exempt taxi travel provided to employees for travel directly between work and home between eight in the evening and six in the morning. The exemption covers taxi travel for the entire journey or part of a direct journey home. It exempts taxi travel provided for sick or injured employees to travel from work to their usual place of residence. The exemption extends to taxi travel between work and home via a doctor's surgery or other place of treatment. It also extends to travel from work to a place where the employee can get care; for example, to a relative's home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This amendment proposes, in effect, to alter those hours for which taxi travel can be provided by an employer to an employee to the hours of 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., rather than from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. We believe that this broadens the exemption in a way which is consistent with the daylight period for employees to be provided with taxi travel to go home. In this day and age with the increasing part-time and casual work and with the increasing use of all times of the day by many business offices, if you go into the cities you often see employees finishing work at 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. Those companies that have international connections and international business, in order to be able to participate in business with overseas businesses who have different times, obviously require employees to be working at times&mdash;often routinely&mdash;beyond 7 p.m. and even often beyond 8 p.m. Given that many of these employees are women, the health and safety reason consistent with the daylight hours is one which we urge upon the government in this particular amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has offered to accept amendments which come forward in relation to this matter. I suppose this, in a sense, is a test of the attitude of the government in reality as opposed to the rhetoric which has just been expressed by the Assistant Treasurer in relation to amendments. If the government is not prepared to accept an amendment which, in the scheme of things, could be regarded as minor in terms of the fringe benefits scheme and regarded as minor in terms of any forgone revenue to the government, then I think that speaks for itself. It says that this is a whole lot of rhetoric we have heard from the Assistant Treasurer about amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, if we came forward with some substantial amendments, which the whole business community has been crying out for&mdash;for example, in relation to trying to align the fringe benefits tax year with the income tax and other taxation years; some substantial amendments which would actually go some way to really reducing the compliance costs of this scheme on business&mdash;we know that would be equally rejected. There is really not much purpose in coming forward with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Assistant Treasurer and the government to accept this amendment. With the working women of Australia in particular now being forced because of changed economic and business circumstances in many instances to travel home after the hours of sunset&mdash;those hours often being after 7 p.m., and in cities like Melbourne, Hobart and Adelaide it starts to get dark at 5 p.m. in winter&mdash;this does seem to me to be a reasonable provision.

I can tell you from my experience in negotiating this package with industry, when I actually sat down with them and talked about the hours in which we should make this concession available&mdash;not from some guesswork&mdash;that 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. is a time period that is acceptable to industry. Of course, if you make it more generous, they are not going to say no. But, in the end, what we are trying to do is to make sure that the concession is given where it is required, not where it is desired.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes substantial improvements to the open learning initiative.

Key objectives of EdNA are to maximise the use of new communications technologies, to improve the quality of learning in the education and training sectors and to maximise industry development of opportunities for Australians.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important aspect of the government's higher education policy is to encourage productive interactions between higher education institutions and industry across all fields. To this end the joint Commonwealth-industry funded additional places scheme was established in the 1991 budget as a partnership between the government and industry. The objectives of the scheme are to provide additional places in higher education institutions and to encourage linkages with industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under existing program arrangements the Commonwealth contributes 60 per cent of the cost of a place and industry the remaining 40 per cent. Approximately 20 per cent of the cost is returned to the Commonwealth by way of HECS. In 1994 the program generated an additional uptake of 868 new places; 74 per cent of places under this scheme were filled by students selected by their employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is keen to build on this success and is revising the program's guidelines to introduce greater flexibility for institutions and industry partners. Part of these changes is to enhance the choices available in relation to HECS charges for students in joint Commonwealth-industry funded places.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present all places under the scheme are HECS liable. Section 35 of the act is amended by this bill to allow a HECS exemption for students occupying places under the scheme. </PARA>

The Commonwealth's contribution will remain at 60 per cent. In such cases the Commonwealth would require institutions to remit the equivalent of the HECS charge. This will not result in an increase in the cost to the Commonwealth and industry will contribute a greater proportion of the cost of the HECS exempt places. As a consequence there will be no net loss of Commonwealth revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment to the scheme will provide greater flexibility to institutions in providing courses at times and under arrangements that are more suited to the needs of industry.

The bill also makes a minor amendment to section 43 to provide that applications for tax file numbers must be lodged directly with the Australian Taxation Office and can no longer be lodged at institutions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) has made clear in the second reading speech, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) covers quite a wide range of matters. It varies the maximum grant amounts for specified years in relation to the operating grants for universities. It varies the maximum grant limits on total funds available to reflect funding for the major research facilities program and general supplementation of funding. It also varies grants amounts for superannuation expenses, grants to teaching hospitals and grants for special capital projects. Open learning organisations will be able to have unused funds rolled over into the funding provided in subsequent years.</PARA></TALK.START>

New provisions put into the act by this bill seek to allow the minister to make a grant for expenditure by a cooperative multimedia centre, to enable an institution to declare that a student whose place is jointly funded by the Commonwealth and industry is an exempt student and is not liable to pay contributions under the HECS scheme and also to enable the secretary to the department to review decisions reconsidering applications by students for remission of a semester debt in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this bill, it will no longer be possible for an application for a tax file number to be lodged with the appropriate officer of an institution.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is therefore a wide ranging bill involving the commitment by the government to significant expenditures of taxpayers' money. It is therefore appropriate to make some very broad comments about the nature of the activities on which this money is to be expended and to measure the performance of the government in relation to the activities against the goals stated by the parliamentary secretary in the second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the government's rhetorical commitment to a higher education system of high quality, excellence and innovation accessible to all Australians, it is quite clear that it is not the reality at all. The higher education system is not accessible to all qualified Australians, not by a long shot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The higher education system in this country at the moment is struggling very greatly to maintain quality and excellence. The system is under strain. The difficulties it is facing as a result of the policies that the government has put in place make a sad mockery of the clever country rhetoric which we used to hear from the former Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just put a few facts on the record. The government's rhetoric says `a system accessible to all Australians'. Nearly 23,000 qualified young Australians were turned away this year from university because the government has failed to provide sufficient funding for those places or establish a system under which those students can get access&mdash;and this is after 12 years of this government. The government will say it has seen a very significant expansion in participation in higher education over this decade, and that is quite correct. It would be a shocking thing if that were not so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expansion of the higher education system has been a national goal of this country for several decades, in fact from the time the Liberal-National coalition government under Sir Robert Menzies led to the establishment of a large number of new universities. Since that time, there has been a consensus in this country that there must be a substantial expansion of the higher education system. For the government to say that it has simply continued the expansion of that system is no real credit to it other than to say that it has done what everyone expected it would do and should do, and that any government would do and must continue to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is patently obvious is that there has been, and remains, a massive gap between the rhetoric of the government that it is going to provide a higher education system which will provide a firm foundation for the so-called clever country. At the same time, it maintains a policy which has excluded year after year tens of thousands of qualified young Australians who are therefore unable to obtain a place within the university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not apply solely to undergraduate students. Let me put another key fact on the record about the current operation of the higher education system. Two-thirds of the qualified students who applied for postgraduate awards this year were turned away. Of the 6,700 eligible students who applied for a postgraduate research award at the beginning of the year, 4,000 missed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an appalling situation, and it was highlighted by Mr Frank Hambly, the Executive Director of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. He said that many of the 4,000 qualified students whom the government refused to fund were among the best and the brightest of the young Australians seeking to build on their abilities and build a base for making a substantial contribution to this country through pursuing postgraduate education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Support for postgraduate education, Mr Hambly said, is critical to Australia and to Australia's economic and social development. We are talking here about our future scientists, our future researchers, our future academics and other senior professionals, yet the government simply says, `We can do without the commitment of 4,000 highly talented young people. We will fund only one-third of the applicants.' This is a country which is desperate for skilled and educated people to compete in an increasingly competitive world, yet we hear this hollow, shallow rhetoric that this is a system accessible to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A generation of the most talented young Australians is being sacrificed at the moment by the higher education policies of this government. For that small proportion who get in to pursue their higher education work in the postgraduate research area, the research infrastructure with which they have to deal is in crisis. It remains grossly underfunded. This is a result of a decade of declining resources per student, a decade of clever schemes to claw back funding from the operating grants of the universities, which has led to a significant run down in the discretionary funds available&mdash;both to bring on the young postgraduate trainees and to foster, build up and keep up to date the research infrastructure of the universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the life of this government, funding per student has declined some 15 per cent. The result of this has been that the students who do get in face huge class sizes, declining quality of library services and overcrowded tutorial rooms. It means that university staff are faced with increasing pressures as they try to cope with these declining resources per student. They try to do the best possible job they can by the students who are crowding into their lecture theatres and tutorial rooms. </PARA>

It may be also useful to put on the record in this House other comments by Professor Gilbert, who said that he was very concerned about the current state of Australian universities. In an address to the Menzies Research Centre, in a seminar only a couple of months ago, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The essential truth&mdash;and I cannot emphasise this too strongly&mdash;is that all Australian universities are precariously placed and precariously funded. The weakest need resources to improve infrastructure, recruit better staff, add greater educational value to the students they enrol. The very best of Australia's universities are under pressures to improve quality that are at least as great.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say&mdash;and this is a sobering comment from someone who has extremely wide respect through the university system:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where does our best university rank among the world's higher education institutions. Perhaps it scrapes into the first 50&mdash;perhaps, perhaps not. Dare we let our best slip even from that precarious level. Dare we risk negotiating the 21st century without even a place at the table of world class intellectual, scientific and cultural discourse?</PARA>
<PARA>In another part of that address, Professor Gilbert said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Higher education quality is under threat. Indeed, perhaps the main reason for the recent emphasis on quality assurance in Australian higher education is academic and public concern that the coming of mass higher education has lowered standards in the universities.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mediocre higher education is the `Banana Republic' option. For an ill-educated, knowledge-poor Australia would not simply become internationally marginalised and economically deprived; it would also have little chance surviving as a stable, liberal democracy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an illustration of the problems that this system faces and the difficulties that Australia's universities are labouring under, let me refer to the launch in June this year of the review of higher education management&mdash;a review which was established by the government without proper consultation with the universities. The minister's announcement of this review speaks of the higher education system as part of the public sector. In a literal sense that may be true, but what is not true is that it is not part of the public service. I would like to quote the then president of the AVCC, who commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to fulfil their missions, universities operate at arms length from Government and with a high degree of independence. The Government must be aware that it is this very autonomy which makes universities so valuable to the nation as a whole and to the Government itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be tragic if this Review resulted in government intruding into the minute workings of universities. Universities are not Government agencies, and they are very different from the private sector, if only in the fact that they do not have the usual pricing mechanisms available to them.</PARA>
<PARA>This review was set up without any consultation with the universities. Some of its terms of reference seem to show an amazing lack of recognition of how the system is currently operating. One of the terms of reference was that the review should ensure that services are provided to overseas students on a full cost recovery basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it were not for the profits which universities are currently deriving from this system, the conditions within the universities would be far worse than they currently are. The government is unaware of this, as is evidenced through the framing of this term of reference. It goes to show how out of touch it is with the real world of higher education. The education section of the Department of Employment, Education and Training is not the same as the Australian higher education section. Regrettably, there is a very substantial gulf between the two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through all of this, the central concept of what universities are about&mdash;that is, centres in the society where there is the capacity to pursue critically the analysis of social issues, to pursue high quality basic research and to be a source of ideas in society&mdash;is constantly being threatened by the government's approach of trying to push more and more students through the system with diminishing resources. The spirit of inquiry is being dulled and is under threat from this very framework. Until the universities have a much greater level of independence and autonomy these threats are going to continue. The system desperately needs a higher level of recognition. Universities need autonomy. Only autonomy is going to guarantee diversity and the quality that comes with diversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion that somehow or other quality can be assured by some quality assurance system, such as the government has put in place, is absurd. The system has been conceptually misconceived. You cannot secure quality by a committee. You certainly cannot make sensible quality judgments about institutions as a whole, given the very wide variety of courses, clients and students to which these universities must cater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the sad consequences of this procedure, which the government has put in place, is that in the markets in Asian countries the ranking and quality of universities have been damned, as a result of this quality assurance system, in the eyes of many people in Asia who might come to Australia. They have been relegated to the lowest categories in the quality assurance system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason we have this system is the government has been hugely embarrassed by the ongoing debate about the damage which its administrative system&mdash;originating in the White Paper of 1988; the Dawkins system&mdash;has done to higher education and by the constant effort to squeeze the system to get more and more funds out of it and to force it to operate at cheaper and cheaper levels. As a consequence, tens of thousands of Australian students have been excluded when tens of thousands of overseas students have been admitted. The research infrastructure of the system has been significantly damaged. The opportunities for talented young Australians to pursue postgraduate work have been squeezed and in general the whole quality of the system has been placed at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, in its efforts to raise more and more money from students themselves, has been extraordinarily hypocritical in its public claims about student fees. It has tried to claim that it has a no fees policy. This policy has got narrower and narrower as it has introduced more fees&mdash;fees for postgraduate courses and backdoor fees for undergraduates. The government knows that is happening. Students on Australian campuses know that there are students who are getting credit for courses, which they have undertaken for fees, which allow them go on and pursue undergraduate degrees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system that the government has tried to put in place is simply breaking down. The students around this country know about and have protested with increasing vigour against the lies and the hypocrisy coming from this government that it is pursuing a no fees policy. It was precisely such a demonstration that led to the famous episode when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said to a large number of students making their views known, `Go and get a job.' They have to go and get a job at a time when the government has been unable to provide sufficient paid employment for around two million Australians and when some 50 per cent of university graduates have full-time jobs a year after they have graduated. They cannot find full-time work and the Prime Minister says to these students, `Go and get a job.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a government which is so grossly out of touch with what people in this country want and has lost sight so much of the basic objectives that we should be aiming at if we are at all serious about trying to produce a clever country that it has become an object of ridicule in the wider community. That is why tens of thousands of the government's traditional supporters are turning against them. No-one in its traditional base, those working class students for which the government proposes such rhetorical concern, can see other than the fact that government is squeezing them harder and harder as it tries to keep its ramshackle administrative system for Australian universities going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the remaining moments, let me comment on the cooperative multimedia centres element in this legislation. The proposed definition of cooperative multimedia centres stipulates that the purpose of such centres is the provision of services relating to education and training and undertaking other activities which will assist in the development of that industry. There is no reference in the definition to research and development. The coalition would like to see this included in that definition. I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment, on behalf of the coalition, to include a reference to research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two major concerns have been raised in relation to the cooperative multimedia centres. The first is that they would be better placed within an area relating to information technology rather than under the umbrella of education and under the control of DEET. The second issue of concern is that the eastern states, and most particularly Sydney, will be favoured over the other states in the allocation of funding for the centres. The cooperative multimedia centres were announced as part of the government's Creative Nation statement. It stated that the courses provided by tertiary institutions, while they included first rate computing and media courses, were not well tailored to multimedia. The government's reaction to this has been to seed the development of six cooperative multimedia centres over the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with all this government's policies in higher education, this one `hit a pothole' to quote Guy Healey in the higher education supplement which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on Wednesday 30 August of this year. Only two of the 18 consortiums which have put in bids to run cooperative multimedia centres have succeeded. Accordingly, a second bidding round is to begin immediately to try to choose four more consortiums to be funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is currently under fire from many sectors of the community for its conduct of policies in this area.

It is part of a broader national strategy to adopt new information and communications services and technologies, the so-called information superhighway.

This is in itself very clear evidence of the commitment of successive federal and state Labor governments to creating an accessible education system. This is important not only for the sake of students. The foundation of a successful world economy is a successful, world class education system which provides the economy with the skills base it needs. This is particularly important in these times of rapid technological change. It is a point that ought to be taken by some people in our universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides a statutory framework for the cooperative multimedia centres. Up to six cooperative multimedia centres will be funded over the next two years. The cooperative multimedia centre program was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the cultural policy statement Creative Nation in October last year. The main aim of the cooperative multimedia centre is to foster the development of a competitive and internationally successful Australian multimedia industry that will serve to link the education and training sectors and the industrial and creative communities and encourage cooperation in research and development, product distribution, management of intellectual property and sharing of access to equipment and facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These centres will support multimedia skill development, assist in the production and distribution of multimedia products for domestic consumption and for export, and accelerate the uptake of multimedia within education and training centres.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interactive multimedia is a very new force in education, art, culture and service. It has the potential to become the biggest information business in the world. With the establishment of cooperative multimedia centres, we can create a dynamic Australian multimedia industry which produces Australian content for both Australian and international consumers. This bill, therefore, provides a tremendous boost to our arts and technological industries, to people with ideas and offers the opportunity for those ideas to be actually realised. The cooperative multimedia centres will enable the education and training sector to do its own job better and more cost effectively, while also providing an important platform for the development of a major new export industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will agree with me that we hope that one of the six new cooperative multimedia centres will be in Adelaide.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Australians are now subject to the worst unemployment and the worst economic growth figures in the nation. It is an absolute disgrace. Between the December 1993 election and June 1995 the rate of job growth was one-third of what was achieved nationally. In June this year there were 3,000 fewer South Australians in work, compared with an increase of 52,000 on a national basis. Yet, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and I know you are holding your eyes down&mdash;despite running the state down, and despite creating this misery, the Liberal government in South Australia has attacked the education system. South Australia, as you and I both know&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Andrew)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;The member for Port Adelaide should not in any sense suggest that the Deputy Speaker is participating in the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw that. I know you are very interested in education. South Australia once had the best education system in the nation. You and I would both agree on that. Today, after two years of the Brown government, we have become one of the worst resourced education systems in Australia. The education minister, Mr Lucas, who, in the election campaign, promised increased funds for schools and training, will have chopped $100 million out of the education budget by 1996. The TAFE system is being similarly gutted, despite the desperate need for educational and training facilities in the most depressed state in the country. Locating a cooperative multimedia centre in Adelaide will go some way towards counteracting the damage that the Brown Liberal state government is inflicting on South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important aspect of this bill is that it provides for greater flexibility to institutions of higher education to fit in with the needs of industry&mdash;a point that seems to be grossly overlooked by the shadow minister. It is consistent with the government's overall strategy of encouraging a productive liaison between the two sectors in order to create a modern work force for a modern economy. To encourage this, the joint Commonwealth/industry funded additional places scheme was established in the 1991 budget as a partnership between the government and industry to provide additional places in higher education. This scheme has undoubtedly been a great success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also includes an amendment with respect to HECS fees to provide for greater flexibility for institutions and industry partners. The aim is to give institutions discretion in deciding whether places offered will be HECS liable or not&mdash;and that was a point that the shadow minister did not emphasise&mdash;without any loss to HECS revenue. The end result will be that institutions will have greater flexibility in providing courses at times and under arrangements that are more suited to the needs of industry. Again, that point was certainly not mentioned by the shadow minister. In fact, when we come down to it, there were not too many valid points offered at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government's record on education is proven. It has demonstrated a commitment to a higher education system that ensures that all Australians have the opportunity to participate. Since 1983, it has increased funding from $3 billion to $5 billion&mdash;a 65 per cent increase. Student numbers have increased from 350,000 to 600,000. That is remarkable growth in anybody's language. It is a pity that it is not acknowledged by many on the other side of this chamber. It is interesting to note that only the shadow minister is speaking on behalf of the opposition in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will also create an additional 40,000 places in TAFE each year&mdash;funding which is additional to, not at the expense of, higher education sector funding. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that both you and I realise that TAFE has a very important part to play in providing the skills and the job readiness for our young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made a substantial investment in the higher education sector because it recognises the central role that universities play in the intellectual, economic and social development of the nation. It is Labor's commitment to education that has doubled the probability of a student completing year 12 and going on to higher education. It is Labor that created a decade of expansion of education opportunity, thereby increasing opportunity for individuals, lifting our economic performance and providing the skills and the flexibility needed in our modern emerging economy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the last election the federal opposition had a policy on fees and vouchers for funding universities, arguing that if we allow overseas students to pay for places, we should let Australian students pay for places. This time around, however, the opposition claims that it will not charge up-front fees to undergraduate students. But is the opposition against fees on the principled grounds of equity or access? No way! That would not surprise anyone on this side of the House. The opposition is not on about access and equity. The opposition has espoused no philosophical objection to up-front fees, but instead is arguing quite consistently that fees cannot be justified at the moment because of the stabilisation in the number of students. That is an interesting comment, isn't it, particularly when the shadow minister made the point about 23,000 students who cannot get into university&mdash;most of whom would choose TAFE, or deferment, or a whole range of other options. How very convenient!</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that proves is that the opposition will say anything in the lead-up to the next poll to mask its true policy positions. That is not new. That is exactly what the Liberals did in South Australia in the lead-up to the last state poll. The Liberals promised to increase spending on education. Two years later, the Liberals have savaged spending on education. A similar about-face on up-front fees can be expected of the federal opposition should it unfortunately win the next poll. The opposition has not given any real commitments to the higher education area. It is promising nothing to the future students of this country. It does not support equitable access to education and it does not support growth in the higher education sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Judging by the record of the Liberal Party in the states, it still fails to grasp the link between education and the nation's economic performance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An opposition victory at the next federal poll would result in a dismantling of educational values and set back the modernising and reskilling of Australia's work force.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are tonight debating the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995, which provides for policy, technical and transitional amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. The bill makes amendments to the act to adjust funding for operating grants to reflect the major research facilities program and to provide supplementation of grants for price movements in respect of superannuation expenses, teaching hospitals and special capital projects; to amend funding amounts in section 22A to reflect the rollover of funding for the Open Learning initiative from 1994 and 1995 into 1995 and 1996 respectively; and to provide for the extension of the Open Learning initiative. Under the extension of the Open Learning initiative, new bodies which could be funded include TAFEs and schools. This new provision is conditional on the new bodies providing teaching and learning assistance which accords with national tertiary education priorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also provide a statutory framework for the cooperative multimedia centres program and introduce funding amounts. The cooperative multimedia centres&mdash;CMC&mdash;program was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his cultural policy statement Creative Nation on 18 October 1994. To foster developments in multimedia, the government will see the development of up to six CMCs over the next two years. The CMCs will be collaborative enterprises between the education and training centres and other public and private organisations. They will facilitate the provision of multimedia education and training. They will also encourage cooperation in areas such as research and development, product distribution and management of intellectual property and sharing of access to physical infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also provide HECS exemption for students occupying places under the joint Commonwealth-industry funded additional places scheme. At present all JCFAP places are HECS liable. The HECS census dates place some restrictions on institutions' ability to run programs using JCFAP places. The amendment will give institutions the discretion to decide whether places offered would be HECS liable or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under existing program arrangements, the Commonwealth contributes 60 per cent of the cost of a place and industry the remaining 40 per cent. Approximately 20 per cent of the cost is returned to the Commonwealth by way of HECS. Under the new arrangements, institutions would have the discretion to deem students HECS exempt where employers pay 60 per cent of the cost of the place. In such cases the Commonwealth would require institutions to remit the equivalent of the HECS charge. As a consequence there would be no net loss of HECS revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also removes references to `appropriate officer of the institutions' from subsection 43(3). This amendment gives effect to an Australian Taxation Office policy decision so that it will no longer be possible for an application for a tax file number by a student to be lodged with an officer of an institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also change the reference to TAFE in the definition of `course of study'&mdash;section 3. The definition of `course of study' has been amended to remove the need for a declaration by the minister that the course is a course of technical and further education. This amendment is required as higher education institutions which deliver TAFE award courses appear to be in breach of the conditions of their funding under the act in the charging of fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also will enable a secretary or delegate to alter or vary a decision in relation to remission of HECS debt once an appeal has been lodged with the AAT. In recent appeals to the AAT, applicants have provided additional documentation supporting their claim for remission which was not available at the time a decision was made by the secretary.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had the documentation been made available, the applicant's debt would have been remitted. Advice from the Office of the Australian  Government Solicitor, New South Wales, acting for DEET in relation to a case before the AAT, indicated that the secretary has no power under the act to issue a further decision once the matter is before the AAT. This amendment allows the secretary to alter or vary a decision on remission of HECS debt once an appeal has been lodged with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, the bill provides a technical amendment to section 110 and various consequential and transitional provisions related to the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is often the case in this place, it is once again a matter of altering and updating legislation to ensure that it takes into account current circumstances and that the system continues to improve. The legislation supports that improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two particular issues about the bill that I would like to touch on briefly: open learning and cooperative multimedia centres. The first stage of an education information superhighway&mdash;a $1.4 million pilot program of the federal government's Open Learning Electronic Support Service&mdash;was launched in Adelaide by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) on 14 September. The press release on that day states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Around 140 Open Learning students will participate in the OLESS pilot project, using personal computers in their homes or visiting local access points at Open Learning Centres across Australia. The number of students is expected to rise to over 300 with the pilot's second stage in December.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Federal Government is prepared to commit up to $10 million for the full implementation of OLESS. Once OLESS is fully operational in March, Open Learning students will be able to dial into the network from home or office using a wide range of personal computers. In the future these services will be extended into the school and vocational education sectors."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OLESS will not be a direct supplier of services but will act as a broker. In that way it will be able to take advantage of both market forces and technological changes to put together the best possible package of services and support for students.</PARA>
<PARA>That system is now being called Open Net, which I think is a more appropriate title for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to cooperative multimedia centres, which the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) and the shadow minister, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), touched on earlier, two of the six proposed cooperative multimedia centres have been announced and a process is under way for the consideration of further applications for an additional four. The hope is that that assessment process will be reporting back by December and that we will have an announcement from the government about the additional four sites. One in Western Australia and one in New South Wales have been okayed. I am certainly keen to see Victoria be successful in the next round of applications. I am confident that the Victorian bids will be in a position to be successful by that time, and I hope that will be the result of the consideration of the assessment panel. The university facilities and the range of companies in that area in Victoria are very well placed to take action on this matter and to make the initiative successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both initiatives are also part of the development which is occurring on a continuing basis in higher education. I started at the Australian National University, just down the road, some 15 years ago. When I go to universities now to look around, I see that things have changed a lot. For one thing, the number of students going through the institutions is significantly higher than it was in my day; that was under the Fraser government. The level of technology required to maximise the capacity for the population to learn has also changed dramatically in that time with the use of computers and the Internet. A whole range of modern technological services is now available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that the government is active in ensuring that we are at the cutting edge of these new technologies and that we maximise the benefits. These technologies also open up a range of other opportunities in terms of distance education which were not around in years gone by. Over time, that will ensure that access to higher education services is greatly expanded. This government has also been committed to expansion through the higher education sector in more conventional terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my local area just over 12 months ago I was happy to represent the government at the opening of the proposal for the Berwick campus of Monash University&mdash;the day my seat was abolished. On that occasion, it was very pleasing to speak to people like the Vice-Chancellor of Monash University about the plans that were held for that site, the hope that we would be seeing through that development the expansion of higher education services into the south-eastern growth corridor. The scope of possibilities for developments at that site was practically endless. I know that opportunities for similar developments were also being investigated regarding Cranbourne, which is in my electorate. Again, this new technology can allow, through computer terminals and other facilities, the development of services in areas that, on questions of economies of scale, would not be able to adequately justify major capital works expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that has been one of the successes of the government over the last 12 years. In education, as in many other areas, we have been able to identify the challenges of the future and address them. We have not always got it right, but we have certainly always endeavoured to get it right. We have been more successful than most, and certainly more successful than our predecessors, with respect to identifying the trends of the future in order to ensure that we address those needs as time goes by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this government has come to power, we have doubled the number of students going through from year 12 to university&mdash;from some 15 per cent to 30 per cent. Also, we have expanded by 65 per cent in real terms the amount of money put into universities&mdash;from $3 billion to $5 billion in constant prices&mdash;and student numbers have increased from 350,000 to 600,000. So I do not think we can accept the argument that we are not addressing the issue of higher education. The amount of change that has occurred in the sector has been quite dramatic, and those circumstances have been difficult for the university sector to cope with. But they certainly have approached it with some rigour and with some innovation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a former union official in the tertiary education sector back in the mid-1980s, I know that there needed to be changes. There was enormous scope for improvements and productivity increases within the higher education sector and in the university sector. Something certainly needed to be done. Although I do not agree with all of the so-called Dawkins reforms in some respects, I do think that they were and are heading in the right direction. They are leading to a capacity to handle greater numbers of students, which is the situation that we face today. Those circumstances are not likely to go away. The fact is that, with new technology in terms of employment and with increased access to education, people will want to take up those opportunities and they will want their children to take up those opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has not just worked on the question of the higher education sector in the narrow sense of the university sector. In terms of TAFE and the university sector, we have endeavoured to develop a more vocational orientation regarding higher education services. We have put massive investment into those areas. We have endeavoured to do so more and more often in consultation with the sector and industry. In doing that, we have maximised our bang for our buck. We maximised the results in terms of the skills acquired, and we maximised the opportunity for people who go through those courses to gain employment at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at this issue, we have to look at our opposition. We heard earlier from the member for Goldstein the problems that he saw with this bill and with the development of the higher education sector. Once again, it was fairly long on criticism but not much in terms of constructive criticism. It was mainly the usual complaints that the government is not doing enough. It did not address what a Liberal opposition would do if it were to gain government. It could be an academic exercise for some higher education institution to look at the opposition's lack of policies, where they are hiding them and what they would do if they were in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the last election, the Liberals went to the campaign on a policy of fees and vouchers for funding universities. The justification then was, `If we allow overseas students to pay for places, why do we not let our own students pay for places?' I do not see the point to that. Maybe that was a while ago, and maybe things have changed, but you still have to wonder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policies announced by the Liberal Party do not tell us very much at all. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 23 February this year, the situation was summed up as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party, however, has been without a semblance of a higher education policy since the sinking of the voucher scheme . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I also note that between 1976 and 1981, when the coalition was in government, the total resources available to higher education institutions fell every year. So you have to question whether they are fair dinkum when they say that they are going to address the problems that they see in the system if they get into government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the shadow minister says that more needs to be done, you have to wonder how he will actually do it. If it is not full fees and not a voucher system, how will he do it? From some of the scant detail that we have heard with respect to coalition policies, we know that they are about cutting government expenditure. We know that the only area they have nominated with respect to that issue has been that of Working Nation. But I am not aware of any commitments with respect to increased funding for higher education. We have not heard them saying that they will address this issue with funds that are required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, we have to look at their policies in the past. They have consisted of fees and vouchers. We have to look at their performance in government. That basically consisted of cuts on a regular basis in terms of funding provided to the university sector. We have to ask why they are not coming clean with their policies and when they will do so. We also have to look at the circumstances with respect to a number of state education systems at the moment and the actions of conservative governments. As a member from Victoria, I can say to the House that the Kennett government's actions on education have been quite horrific. I can also say that we did not know about that before the election. The Victorian public was not told what was going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kennett government has now closed over 200 schools throughout the state. To be fair, they have not worried about where they have closed the schools in terms of their constituencies; they have closed them all over the place. They have closed rural schools and metropolitan schools. They have closed them in safe conservative suburbs and in safe Labor areas. They have closed them in more established areas, and in newer areas they have not opened anywhere near the amount that is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to look at class sizes in schools. Class sizes in Victoria are going up. The justification for that was that we had a better than national average position. Maybe that explains why we have a better than national average rate of retention, a better than national average pick-up of students entering the university sector. Class sizes have gone up, and that is having an impact on education levels. Support services have also been affected. A range of programs has been cut, which has meant that support services to kids who may have a particular need are disappearing, and they are not being replaced. Similarly, where student organisations have had an organised focus for dissent, the Victorian government has endeavoured to stop it and to cut the funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So under the previous conservative government, funding was cut. They have not really got a policy now. The last policy they had was for full fees and voucher systems. In Victoria, in South Australia&mdash;as mentioned by the member for Port Adelaide&mdash;in Western Australia and in Tasmania, conservative governments have clamped down on education expenditure generally and have degraded the value of their education system and therefore the result that has on their students. We have to wonder how seriously we can take what has been said by the opposition and the shadow minister with respect to what they will do in the area of education. We have to wonder how serious they are when they shed crocodile tears about what they see with respect to access and people missing out. We have to wonder about their actions in the Senate in relation to the proposed changes in legislation by the government which, if blocked, will lead to a loss of places across Australia. We have to wonder what that really means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has a proud record in terms of higher education expenditure. We have delivered on a range of promises that we have made over a number of years in that field. We have increased student numbers, built new universities and increased expenditure on a regular basis throughout our term in government. And the result has been a better education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an education system which still needs to improve because the circumstances we face in 1995 versus those in 1975 or 1980 are very different. They are circumstances that need innovative developments such as those mentioned earlier in terms of open learning and the cooperative multimedia centres. We need to maximise the use of that technology in circumstances which make it available to the people who need it. We need to ensure there is equity in placement in higher education places and that universities continue to grow and develop their acts around improving their position in terms of providing the services that are urgently needed by the young of this country. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

Both those members on this side of the House have had a long-standing interest in educational issues and affairs. It is good to see the quality of their contribution to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is important in several respects. It builds upon the broad and continuing commitment of the government to higher education in Australia. It does that by providing additional resources to ensure that higher educational institutions in Australia are equipped to provide quality tertiary education to all Australians who seek it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also provides resources to mount new initiatives in the education and technology areas. I do not think there would be any member in this House who does not agree with the proposition that Australia must enter this zone very quickly, and with resources and skills, if we are to maintain our position in global terms as a nation which puts a very high priority on the education of its citizens and a society that acknowledges the central position of education to its long-term competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) for the measures that have been introduced by the government. We know of the minister's long-standing commitment to education and training. That is being matched by the resources that the government has provided to these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than canvassing all the elements of the bill&mdash;they are covered in the second reading speech&mdash;I would like to refer to a couple of initiatives that relate to the use, further development and application of new technologies in tertiary education in Australia. The information society is really upon us. I think we all acknowledge that. We are in the middle of a revolution but I am not quite sure all of us fully understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recall from my younger days my father expressing some exasperation at the new technologies he had to come to terms with as a dairy farmer in the western district of Victoria. It was not only in the area of earning his income; it was in his household and in his daily life. He used to muse very much about where society was heading with the introduction of these new technologies. I can recall in my very formative years milking the cows by hand. Then came the economic decision for the family to introduce milking machines to the farm enterprise. Our farm was not large enough to sustain the capital expenditure that was required and we were restructured out of that industry, you might say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recall even in the home the new technologies that were being introduced. We never had television. I used to wait with breathless anticipation before the big radio screens that we had in those days. They were rather large radio consoles. My father explained television to me, saying there would be moving pictures coming upon the screen. I used to gaze at the radio console, waiting for the images to appear&mdash;they never did. My father had a problem coming to terms with the technology that changed the way he went about earning his living and changed his lifestyle. In a sense, I am in that same position today, as are all members of this House and all members of society. The information and technology revolution is proceeding at a pace which is changing the way that we earn our living and is changing the way that we live our lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I am not quite sure that we fully understand the momentous changes that are upon us. Yet, we have the means to understand those momentous changes. The means are here in a sophisticated educational infrastructure and in the technologies that are at our disposal now as Australians. One of the great tasks in our modern industrial economy is to bring together those two aspects of education and the use of technologies to ensure that our children do have a well developed understanding of the changes that are taking place around them. Indeed, it is a hard race to run. My son tears his hair out at his father's incapacity to come to terms with what he regards as the very simplest of technologies; but I do try and I am learning all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that governments appreciate the depth of the struggle that ordinary Australians are having in coming to terms with the new technologies and that they ensure that adequate resources are made available to the whole community to ensure that nobody downs tools and nobody loses heart in the quest to get on top of these new technologies. The information society presents us with great challenges as a society. I have mentioned the economic challenge. The use of new technologies in industry is going to be one means by which we retain and improve our international competitiveness. Technology may be easy to adapt in many workplaces, but we have to understand not only its economic significance but also its social and cultural significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Great social questions are raised by the information age and the advances in new technology. It is those social questions that the government seeks to answer by providing the resources that it does in this bill and in the programs that this government funds. There is the all important question of equity and access to these new information technologies. How do we live and organise our lives? Will we really understand and be able to manipulate these new technologies to our benefit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a government, we have a responsibility to ensure that we redistribute income in this country, as best we can, to give everybody a shot at this title. I am sad to say that, at some levels of government, that understanding is not there. The equity argument is not understood and does not make its way into the programs of certain state governments that have been referred to here by the member for Port Adelaide and the member for Corinella. There are also cultural questions which are raised by the advent of the information society. How do we preserve our national identity? How do we ensure that the particular quirks of our language are retained?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are very important considerations. Of course, the more our young people understand these technologies the more they will be able to forge a national identity of their own over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new technology poses significant challenges to our national identity. We see that amongst our young people today in the computer games that they play, the language used in those particular games and the way in which our young people mimic the fashion trends that originate elsewhere. As a community we face the challenge of really providing the resources to our young people to understand these technologies and their applications and in some way preserve that great national identity that we have been able to forge here since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest legacy we can leave our children and our young people is to resource the infrastructure necessary for them to make their way in the new information age. The greatest gift we can give them is the skill and confidence to utilise these new technologies and the expansion of the information base, and to ensure that they exert some measure of control and dominance over these extraordinary developments that are now shaping their lives. That is what this bill is about, essentially. It is about governments stepping into this ring and guiding that understanding, making sure that adequate resources are provided so that Australians can access the new technologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to this, of course, is education. This government has done more than any other government in our postwar history to provide a program focus and resources to ensure that Australians have that education and that access to new technologies and will be able through that to exert control over these technologies. In a very real sense, the measures contained in this bill are designed to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) mentioned in his speech, the bill will provide for an extension of the Open Learning initiative. It is through this particular initiative that we are overcoming the tyranny of distance. Our past economic performance very much depended on the way in which we moved goods around this nation in an efficient manner. We are still coming to terms with creating better efficiencies in those areas. But to overcome the tyranny of the new technology and the tyranny of distance, it is most important that national governments play a very constructive role in opening up access for its population to the new technologies. We are doing this through the Open Learning initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One important element of the Open Learning initiative is the Open Learning electronic support service&mdash;Open Net&mdash;which will provide technical and learning assistance to students enrolled under this Open Learning initiative. Open Net will assist students by allowing them to communicate with other students across the length and breadth of Australia. It will allow them to communicate directly with their tutors by E-mail through the transfer of assignments, bulletin boards, accessing electronic library services and accessing other information resources such as the Internet. It is the government's intention that Open Net will be expanded into a broader educational network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you pin it all down, this particular initiative, Open Net, has very simple objectives: to maximise the use of new technologies in education to open up their access to all Australians and, most importantly, to provide affordable access. I do not think we ponder enough on this particular point. It is no use providing resources in this area unless they are affordable and accessible to all Australians. Of course, another primary objective of the Open Net is to increase the quality of learning experiences to Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other provisions in this bill provide funding in a statutory framework for the cooperative multimedia centres. These came out of the Creative Nation document which acknowledged the need to create a dynamic multimedia industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a very interesting experience shortly after I was elected as a member of Corio. I got a call from a man who operated a small business in a suburb called Norlane in my electorate. He said that he was developing some new initiatives utilising the multimedia technology and asked me whether I would come out and see it. I said, `I will come out but I will go one better. I will bring the minister for small business, Chris Schacht, out to see you as well'&mdash;I had the minister visiting the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a most interesting experience because the enterprise that we visited was contained in two houses side by side that the owner had converted to this purpose. I did not know a lot about multimedia technology at that time. We went inside where about five young people were working on a project to produce electronic multimedia games for the international market. It was most intriguing to observe the skills that they were bringing to bear on this task. They did the whole graphic presentation of the game and the musical score and they produced a whole lot of ancillary materials associated with this game. They were seeking a very small amount of money to fund the production on this game on a commercial basis and launch it on the domestic and international markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Creative Nation was not in place some 18 months or two years ago, or else this enterprise, I am sure, would have been up and running and would have been at the leading edge of these developments. When we sat down and analysed the assistance that we could bring to bear on the task, we found that we were unable to help from a government point of view. So we put these entrepreneurs in touch with private developers who said, `It is too risky.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 18 months later, I spoke to the entrepreneur and asked him how he went with developing the game. He said, `I had to unload it to a British firm for $120,000 to pay our debts.' I said, `I guess something is better than nothing.' He said, `Well, it all had a street value of $1.2 million and that's what we missed.' This highlights the fact that this government has seized the times in providing resources to develop these technologies. All right, this one did not get up, but others will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate Deakin University is at the forefront of the utilisation of the new technologies in the information age and in education. In 1995, Deakin University was declared the university of the year. It is quite a unique university. It operates three campuses in Melbourne and two in regional areas located in Geelong and Warrnambool. With the assistance of better cities money provided by the federal government, the university will be shortly moving into a new developed campus in the Deakin wool stores in the centre of Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deakin University won this title as the 1995 University of the Year against the intense competition of some 38 universities. The award acknowledges Deakin's national leadership in enhancing undergraduate education through imaginative and innovative uses of new information and communication technologies. When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) presented the award, he said this about the university:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deakin is an unconventional university, but a good one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the student can't come to the university, Deakin takes the University to the student. Deakin students work from mines and factories and offices, as well as from classrooms and lecture theatres, but through the use of computers and e-mail and faxes and printed materials, they engage in the dialogue that is the hallmark of the traditional university education. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need only comment on the contribution of the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). To start, I should put the  bill in its broader perspective, which is to meet the objectives of the government's higher education policy. In that regard, the objectives are the government's commitment to an accessible, diverse, innovative and publicly funded system of higher education. To the extent that those objectives are there, this bill seeks to address them in four ways. Those four ways are the cooperative multimedia centres, Open Learning Australia, improvements to the joint Commonwealth-industry funded additional places, and the major national facilities fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Goldstein obviously likes the provisions of the bill because he did not seek to speak about them at any length. He sought to criticise government policy generally. He has that luxury, because there is a government policy on education. This government is very proud that it is a government that has policies. We have Working Nation, Creative Nation and our education policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition have no policies. They are so devoid of policy in the area of education that even their friends in the media have seen fit to run editorials criticising them for their complete lack of policy. No opposition in the world would have the courage to not have a policy, but we have found one in this country. This opposition have been so scared by their previous electoral experiences that they now wish to run in an election without telling the Australian people any details of their policies. They are making general, nice cooing noises about what they might do or not do. They will not be allowed to get away with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Goldstein will eventually be brought to the bar of the House and forced to disgorge what policies, if any, the opposition has. In the meantime, he wants the luxury of criticising what the government does without ever being prepared to put anything constructive before the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has chosen to criticise the government for its successful policy. He referred, quite rightly, to the massive increases in funding under this government in the area of education. It does not hurt to remind the House and the Australian people of those increases. The total number of students in higher education has increased from 348,000 in 1983 to 585,000 in 1995. That is something like a 68 per cent increase. That is a very significant figure and something of which Australians can be proud. As I travel overseas, I find that other countries are amazed by our performance in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Goldstein referred to the 23,000 students that were unable to gain a place in higher education this year. They are, of course, his figures. He has totally ignored and does not want to even admit the government's initiatives in addressing the problems of unmet demand. A further 11,000 places were announced in the recent budget. Those places are unfortunately in jeopardy because of the actions of the honourable member for Goldstein and his friends in another place who are seeking to amend the budget legislation that is to be debated tomorrow. Because of this opposition ineptitude and their failures in the democratic process, the budget bill is in danger of losing $20 million per year, which means that 2,000 young Australians who would otherwise get places in higher education will not do so if this is the case. I only hope that the Australian Democrats and the Greens can see what the opposition are doing in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow spokesman, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill), is on record as saying that the opposition will not be proceeding with up-front fees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's problem is that they have a number of spokespersons saying different things. Senator Hill says one thing and the honourable member for Goldstein says another. The honourable member for Goldstein criticises the government, for example, in the number of postgraduate awards available to students. These awards are competitive. It should be recognised that the number of higher degree students has grown under Labor by 172 per cent from 25,000 in 1987 to 68,000. Commonwealth expenditure in higher education has increased by 36 per cent from $3.1 billion in 1983 to $5.1 billion in 1995. All these things are happening and yet the carping critics are still there criticising away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say a few words about the cooperative multimedia centres. The government has also announced a second round of these centres. The other submissions in their present form  did not meet the guidelines laid down by the government. If we had funded them, we would have been in trouble with the Auditor-General about it. But we do have a policy of developing these centres. I think it is an excellent idea. </PARA>

We have been able to export it as a product, so well regarded is that system throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This system is taking advantage of innovative ideas and using technology to overcome the tyrannies of distance that we have always suffered in this country.

It is a system which has significantly extended opportunities for all Australians. It is an expansion which is being achieved without introducing fees for undergraduates. Australian undergraduate students do not pay for their education until they reach average weekly earnings. They do not pay up front, as was proposed by the opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree entirely with the comments of the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), only I do not think I would have bothered to give credibility to the statement by even referring to it. It really is a load of nonsense. We have heard a lot in this House in the last few days about opposition policy and where this country is going in policy terms. I come from the state of Victoria where, of course, a Liberal Party is in government. It is very easy in Victoria to find out exactly what the Liberal Party stands for. One has only to look at what Jeffrey Gibb Kennett and his colleagues are doing in Victoria, and we know exactly what we would get from a Liberal government led by Mr Howard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to draw attention to the state of the Country Fire Authority in Victoria. No-one would argue that country fire authorities are very important in rural Australia. Indeed, many urban rural fire brigades are the sole fire protection authorities for many growing parts of metropolitan Melbourne. They are also staffed by volunteers and are a branch of the CFA in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Country Fire Authority, as we all know, both at the urban and CFA level is staffed primarily by volunteers. I do not think any Australian would say that there is a finer body of people&mdash;men and women&mdash;who do quite astonishing things when this country is ravaged by one of its common foes, fire. In New South Wales more recently than in Victoria, unfortunately, we saw the effect of fire and the enormous human cost both to property and life and the environment generally that these fires cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So these authorities are fundamentally important. As a Victorian I am awfully proud of the efforts that CFA has made in my electorate over a number of years. In their basic structure, the CFA have full-time professional officers, but the vast bulk of their organisation comes from volunteers. Without the full-time professional officers it is much more difficult to organise the volunteer fire fighters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic rationalists of the Liberal Party&mdash;the sort we have here in Canberra&mdash;who are now in government in Victoria are cutting funds right across Victoria. There is no policy about what they do. They simply say, `In budget terms we take this money out of the system and then you people deliver the service. We don't care what you have to do but you must deliver the service.' There has been no discussion on policy and no consultation. They have simply taken the money away. They are taking money away from the Country Fire Authority and the authority's response to that is to start to make redundant&mdash;the usual Liberal Party term for sacking people: making them out of work&mdash;the full-time officers of the CFA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in Victoria we are going to have a situation where in urban fire brigades which currently have full-time fully paid officers who operate on a quick response time, who are the training officers and who maintain the equipment on a full-time basis, the officers will no longer be there. That immediately increases the response time. For example, Ernst and Whinney, one of the four major chartered accountants in Australia, indicated in a major study that that would cause an increase in the average response of four minutes to call-out. The average response would be 12 minutes. The increase would cost an enormous amount of money in terms of damage to a burning house. It would also endanger the occupants of that house. The risk of damage to people in a burning building would increase dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to wonder at the morality of a political party which would do this to such a major volunteer organisation. This is only one example of the sorts of things we are seeing in Victoria from the economic rationalists in the Liberal Party, driven not by social need or caring for the community but by the bottom line&mdash;the dollar. They are always driven by economic outcomes. They do not care if rural communities in Victoria are going to suffer increased damage by fire and increased costs to the community because of paltry savings of just over $1 million in relation to the CFA. When the Liberals and the National Party here talk about policy, we know what they stand for. We know what they will do. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to express my outrage at the decision today by the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, to sell 100 per cent of the State Bank of Western Australia&mdash;Bankwest or the old R&amp;I&mdash;to the Bank of Scotland. On a day when we see John Howard telling foreign investors at an MTIA seminar that they should continue to invest in Australia and then subsequently doing a stunt on foreign debt, Richard Court sells the R&amp;I Bank, or Bankwest, to Edinburgh. Howard says that the Western Australian state government's policies are his model. This means that he will sell Telecom to any overseas telecommunication company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regard the sale of Bankwest to the Bank of Scotland as a great lost opportunity. It is a lost opportunity for Western Australia because it means the prospect, or the chance, of having a strong Western Australian regional bank is lost. That is as a result of the inability of the Premier of Western Australia, or his refusal, to achieve the best model for a regional bank in Western Australia&mdash;namely, to have effected a merger between Challenge Bank and Bankwest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure to effect this best result for Western Australia is clearly the personal responsibility of Richard Court. It is unquestionably the case that a merger between Challenge and Bankwest has been opposed for whatever reason by management of Bankwest, particularly the former chairman, Mr Ross Garnaut, and the chief executive officer, Warwick Kent. But any premier worth his salt would have been able to override these management blinkered views and achieve a best result for Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have now is the danger of having no effective Western Australian regional bank at all. That is a direct result of the lack of capacity of the Premier and the government of Western Australia to effect a merger between Bankwest and Challenge which has resulted in a proposed takeover by Challenge Bank of Westpac, which is subject to TPC consideration, and now the sale of Bankwest, or the old R&amp;I, effectively to Edinburgh Castle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to draw attention to what some commentators and indeed the Premier himself have had to say. Today, when announcing the sale to the Bank of Scotland, the Premier of Western Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are receiving a very good price for the bank but more than that we are going to end up with a strengthened financial institution in WA and not just being a branch operation of an eastern states' bank. . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It will end up being a post box for Edinburgh Castle. This stands in stark contrast to his comments to the Western Australian parliament on 3 May this year when he assured the state parliament, and I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . no way would we want 100 percent overseas control of BankWest. We want the maximum level of Western Australian ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>The score is 100 Scotland: zero Western Australia. Previously commentators, when referring to the possible merger between Bankwest and Challenge, have spoken in the following terms: Stephen Bartholomeusz from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> has said that the Challenge proposal ought to be `irresistible'. Ivor Ries from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> has said that the case for merging Challenge Bank and Bankwest was `compelling'. Brian Frith from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> has written that the bank merger would be a `beautiful fit'. Stephen Bartholomeusz said again in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> that the merger of the two banks would produce substantial synergies but would minimise the risk of loss of market share that normally occurs in bank mergers. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would create a $12 billion bank&mdash;about three times the size of Challenge&mdash;and would ensure that there weren't two WA institutions of modest size competing for the limited pool of funding and assets available.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact that this is a personal decision of Richard Court has been made clear by some of the writers on this matter. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> Nigel Wilson has referred to the Western Australian Premier, Mr Court, as having personal control of Bankwest's destiny. In another article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> he referred to Premier Court assuming responsibility for the bank privatisation process. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> recently, Ivor Ries wrote as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . BankWest's management was cool on any association with Challenge. And WA Premier Richard Court refused to show any sense of commitment, forcing Challenge to find an alternative.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ries concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Court has just discovered, the commercial world sometimes just can't wait for politicians to get up off their hands and do something.</PARA>
<PARA>I have never been able to understand the ideologically blinkered view of Dr Garnaut in his refusal to countenance a proper examination of a merger in this matter in the face of overwhelming evidence that it was in both the public interest and the state interest to do so. But it is almost criminal negligence on the part of the Premier of Western Australia to allow the set of circumstances to occur where there will be no effective regional bank for Western Australia and the old R&amp;I will be sold to the Bank of Scotland. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the winning essay from Fayleen Scherger, who won the secondary section. She is a year 11 student at the Abundant Life Christian School at Kingaroy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of time constraints, it was not possible to read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the winning primary essay. The winner was Amanda Watson-Brown of the Nanango State School. She is in year 7. The topic for the primary section was the same as the secondary section&mdash;that is, `How should governments treat families?' I would like to read the essay into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for the permanent record. She wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments should be of the people, by the people and for the people. The question has been asked how should governments treat families. The answer should be treat them as you would treat your own family.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Society today accepts many definitions of what makes a family. As a member of an ordinary family, the problems we face would be the same as those faced by the majority of families. I think governments should give more help to small businesses and encourage people to be self sufficient. The average family has both parents working or attempting to work. Governments should be concerned with families as they are the backbone of society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bob Hawke, when he was in power said "no child would be living in poverty by the year 1990". This has not happened and many families are still struggling. No matter what party is in power and what promises they make children are the most important part of the family as they are this countries future citizen. Many children are still leaving home and living on the streets. Australia has the largest youth suicide rate in the world. Governments should give youth some hope for the future. Many times young people search and search for work. If there was more co-operation between employers, government and school, families would be happier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Howard (C.M. 7 June) stated that if he was elected his government would provide "A national child immunisation programme to achieve as close as possible to 100% immunisation." This would ensure that our children would be protected from preventable diseases. The hospitals in all states are overcrowded. We often hear of people not being able to get treatment at the big hospitals. If families had the choice of paying into a health care fund or paying the medicare levy, some of the problems would be solved. Many church groups are providing services that governments could provide from taxes collected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have read a book called "Waiting for May" by Thyrza Davey. In this the problem arises when an elderly man wants to stay on his houseboat rather than go into a home. The social worker is trying to force him to go. Governments should provide the elderly with as much help as possible so they can stay in their own homes as long as is possible. Sometimes pensioners feel they would be better off not owning a home as they could get lots more help. Governments would make the elderly more happy if they thought of them and gave living assistance to all pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many members of parliament get to know the people in their electorate. This makes people happy as they feel that the person they voted for is really working for them. That's the most important way governments should treat families. They should be treated with respect, care and consideration and that is a good way of building up people's confidence in government.</PARA>
<PARA>When the two essay winners were down in Canberra, as I mentioned last night, they had the opportunity of visiting Parliament House, and seeing the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). They visited question time in both houses of parliament and had the opportunity of visiting a range of other major attractions in Canberra including Questacon, the National Gallery and the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When in Canberra, they were hosted and chaperoned by Mrs Judy McArdle, from my office. I would like to take this opportunity to place on the record my thanks to her for the way in which she made sure these two young people had an understanding of the way a nation is governed and also making their visit to Canberra a great enjoyment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak this evening about a new railway station that is going to be opened next month in the lower Hunter. It is a railway station that will service the Newcastle university campus. It is going to be of enormous value to university students in the electorate of Paterson although the station itself will not be in the electorate of Paterson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to trace the history of this railway station because I find it very interesting. This railway station has come about by a study that was carried out in the late 1980s and early 1990s and funding was made available by the then Minister for Land Transport, my colleague the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). He saw the need for this railway station, university students had approached him directly, and $3 1/2 million of federal funding was made available in 1992 to it. Whether it was indifference, sloth or simply lack of will by the former Fahey government in New South Wales, this railway station was put on hold despite its obvious need, its obvious value, to people in the area surrounding urban Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this railway station will mean to students in the electorate of Paterson is that they will be able to live at home and have access to the university campus daily, and their parents will not have to buy them a car or rent them a flat. Students from the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) will also be able to utilise this facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amazing thing about the delay is that during the three years the Fahey government had the funding available for this, it fast tracked a railway station in urban Maitland&mdash;a railway station that was never planned for a suburb that is yet to be built&mdash;claiming that it was the first railway station to be built in New South Wales since, I think, the Second World War. It refused steadfastly to construct the Warrabrook station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shameful thing about that delay is that it was by a party that claims concern for Australia's youth, for Australian families. The value of the Warrabrook station is that it will directly serve the youth of the Hunter. It will directly serve families of the Hunter by ensuring that families will be able to stay together, have reduced cost and parents will have the added knowledge that their children are travelling to university safely and efficiently and that they could be home every night if they so desired. Their lives will change because of this railway station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to compliment the honourable member for Charlton for his action back in 1992. It was something that was carried out in support of a call by the university students at Newcastle at that time. It will be a great day next month when this station is opened. It is a shame it has taken so long. I can assure members of this House that I will be there when it is opened. I will acclaim it. I look forward to many university students from the electorate of Paterson using it regularly. </PARA>

I wish to briefly read some excerpts of their winning essays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naxhija wrote about the experience of people in Macedonia during the war, the difficulties and depravations which were faced particularly by families in captivity. Her essay is dedicated to the memory of her grandfather, Estref, who as a boy, as she says in her essay, lived the story above. I will just read her opening paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The year is 1944 and the Germans have taken over our country, Macedonia. The men, young and old, have run off into the hills and forests to fight the Germans with the partisans. We are all prisoners in our own country. There is a field&mdash;a field of ruins, bones and bodies. Innocent adults and children try to escape but do not succeed and now we have to live behind the wire. All the adults living here are women. Their husbands, sons and lovers all dead or escaped to fight the invaders with the resistance, the partisans. Some children have lost one or both of their parents and are being cared for by a relative or just by a kind hearted stranger.</PARA>
<PARA>In her essay, Elizabeth Chen also wrote about the impact of the Second World War on families, especially on a couple then recently married and then parted by the consequences of war. She wrote partly from the perspective of women at home. I would like to quote one paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The work was exhausting and boring. I worked 11 hours a day and seven days a week. The factory is cold and we often work dressed in coats and scarves. But the thought of how we were helping to win the war and maybe save some lives really warmed me up. Some of my girlfriends joined the services as WACS and WAAFS and others went to work on the land as farmers to take the place of farm workers who had joined up.</PARA>
<PARA>In her essay, Kathryn Young wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1939 meant the commencement of World War II which inevitably affected every Australian. The courageous young men who defended our country, the determined women who were left behind to enter the work force and maintain the Australian economy and supplies for the soldiers, the sweethearts and families of the boys sent away, the families of young soldiers who died in the line of </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">duty experienced pain and heartache that we, the youth of today, can only imagine. In our world, living in the 1990s, young people have never experienced rationing of food supply, preparing for bomb raids or losing loved ones in a war spanning almost six years. Our lives are immensely diverse in comparison to those of the generations preceding ourselves. War is particularly cruel to the families of the soldiers. Before this year, I could never have really wanted to know what involvement my family had in World War II. However, this year, due to the 50th anniversary, I became quite fascinated with my family's experience. I asked my grandmother about her experiences in the war and discovered many things I would never have imagined could have happened to my average family.</PARA>
<PARA>Kathryn finished on this note:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The youth of today need to be informed about the terrible severity of war and some of the ghastly things which occurred during the war periods. In 20 years time, there will be no living survivors to talk first hand about experiences which happened during the war, so information will be excavated from history books. First hand primary sources are much more reliable than secondary sources, because when all the remaining war veterans who hold knowledge of war having been part of it and have in time all passed on, who will be around to inform young people of their past which will inevitably help them achieve a brighter future?</PARA>
<PARA>These essays illustrate one of the great benefits of this Australia Remembers year&mdash;that young people such as Naxhija, Elizabeth, Kathryn and many others, not only in my electorate but all throughout this land, have learned something in a real way about the history of this country and have learned a lot about the experiences which their own parents and their generation had. I am proud to host these young people here. I am grateful to you, Mr Speaker, for spending some time with them this afternoon, as other colleagues have done. I hope that this experience enriches their lives and, through them, this nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anybody who goes back to that speech will find substantial pleas for an industrial relations system that contained a bit of flexibility; in fact, you could read into it the argument for enterprise bargaining. I made those arguments from long experience&mdash;close to 25 years&mdash;of employing people in a large range of industries, including the transport sector. It is interesting to note that enterprise bargaining is as old as the process of employment. When we did not have unions and awards, enterprise bargaining was the only arrangement available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have lived in a business environment of award structures, and I found that those people whom I wanted to employ usually wanted an enterprise bargain. I never found that the truck driver on line haul wanted to be paid the award. If they walked into your place looking for the vacancy that you had advertised and you said, `I pay the award', they would say, `Thanks very much' and turn round and walk out again. They did not want the award. They did not want the restrictions that it placed upon them; they wanted an enterprise bargain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strangely enough&mdash;and I know it is anathema to many union bureaucrats&mdash;the simple fact was that in the transport sector on line haul the truck drivers mostly wanted trip money. They wanted trip money because it allowed them some flexibility in getting from A to B&mdash;some might argue more quickly than they were allowed. It allowed them to meet their commitments and to earn good money if they could fit in an extra trip. In most freight situations you find that there is a load in one direction but not necessarily in the other: it is known as back loading. The drivers were very happy if they got an incentive for back loading and&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;they usually found a back load. If they were under the award, the truck came back empty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union in that industry is held up to the community  as being both powerful and influential, but out there on the ground the fellow who drives a truck in those sorts of situations was always anxious to strike an enterprise bargain. That was even more notable in our more remote areas. The people who chose to go there were of a more enterprising nature. Naturally they were not looking for an enterprise bargain that reduced their opportunity to earn money; they wanted an enterprise bargain that allowed them to earn more money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, they were able to get it. As I said in relation to back loading, in every case the deal recognised that the guy who owned the truck needed to make a profit to stay in business and create jobs. These fellows all understood that; they were the salt of the earth. I never could work out why people so loved driving a truck. In later years I was able to say to two or three of them, `Would you like to own this truck?' They said, `How could I do that, I haven't got any money?' I said, `I'm quite happy to advance you in business, I'll guarantee your loan.' I did so on a number of occasions&mdash;being one of those villainous bosses who extract everything from the worker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put four or five fellows, who had given me good service for three or four years, into a truck and let them subcontract to the business with which I was associated. As it was a cooperative, I was a director and not an owner. To the best of my knowledge, a number of them are still doing extremely well. One fellow was a Maori, and he and his wife were two of the hardest working people I have ever met. She could drive the truck better than he could&mdash;and did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These were the sorts of people whom I saw through five or six years of their business until they could stand on their own two feet. Not one of them let me down. They were the people who were willing to go into enterprise agreements, and willing to grasp the first opportunity to be an owner of a truck&mdash;even though this generally reduced their disposable income. They had to meet the payments on the truck, fuel tax and sales tax, and everything else associated with running one of those businesses. Prior to the last election we worked out that those costs were about $2,000 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has never been a time when enterprise agreements were not in fashion; they just were not formalised. We now have a report on enterprise agreements in their formalised sense and I wish to make a few remarks about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to repeat something I say from time to time&mdash;I have referred to it a little already&mdash;that is, this business of villainous, grasping bosses, which is the only sort of rhetoric which our trade union bureaucracy uses to defend their existence, to defend their salary structures and to defend their right to a living. They say, `We have to protect you from those villainous employers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, we have 800,000 or 900,000 small businesses in Australia. It is argued that, if they took on one extra employee each, they would wipe out the unemployment pool. We know that is easier said than done. I would say 95 per cent of that group could never be categorised as villainous or grasping. They are frequently, and on most occasions, one of the workers. You can go into many of these workplaces around Australia and have some difficulty identifying the boss, because he looks awfully like everybody else in the workshop. If he is in shorts and long white socks, he is not the boss; he is the visiting salesman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people are employers of a huge percentage of the Australian work force. They are on equal terms with them and frequently, as I just mentioned with the owner-driver truckie, have less disposable income than many of the people they employ. They also have a huge appreciation of the value of good employees, the ones who turn up to work regularly, are innovative and are committed to the work ethic. For the only reason that they do not want to lose them, they tend to pay them over the award. In other words, they have an enterprise agreement and it reflects those people's good performance. Every time we hear about this unfair dismissal law, it presupposes the bosses get to work every morning, particularly this group of small employers, and say, `Who can I sack today? Ha, ha, ha.'

He saw it as having to sell the land on which his factory stood. He was more concerned how, if he survived the recession we had to have, he would recover this wonderful asset. He knew as he let them go that they were not going to go on the dole. They were the people who would find another job because they were good at their job and he was paying them over the award.

That is a lot of rubbish. The truckies never said, `I want to apply for a job with you, Mr Tuckey. I want trip money. I want an enterprise agreement and, by the way, can I call up Billy Smith to come and hold my hand while I deal with you?' They were all about six feet tall. Their feet were nearly as wide as their shoulders. They did not need any help. If they had been dissatisfied with the way I was running the business, they would have given me a bit of advice on that too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are thousands of these workers around the place. They have always got a job. They change them from time to time and they do not need anybody's help. They know their value, they know the market and they know what they want. They do not need any of this help. Consequently, they get to the point where, in terms of enterprise agreements, they find it all a bit of a joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worse than that because on 20 March 1995 Deakin University put out the results of some interesting surveys done by a masters student, Glennis Hanley, under the supervision of Associate Professor Alan Hope in the School of Economics. I do not think Deakin would be considered a right-wing university. They pointed out some very interesting things which I would have thought was a great message to the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research found that, while the union members tended to be satisfied with traditional union issues, an important factor affecting a unionist's satisfaction related to relationship or communication issues, such as never seeing the trade union representative anymore. These issues included listening to members' concerns, keeping members informed about union affairs and giving members a say in how the union is run. `The importance placed by unionists on relationship issues suggests that, with the larger union structures following amalgamation, rank and file members feel distant, even remote, from union hierarchy,' commented Ms Hanley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important finding of the research was that 40 per cent of members claimed that they joined the union because of either a perception of compulsion or actual compulsion. Of the remainder, only a small group, around 13 per cent, could be described as union `idealogues' committed to the values of trade unionism. The research also revealed that, given trade union membership has fallen from 51 per cent of the employed work force in 1976 to around 35 per cent today, a significant proportion of union members, 40 per cent in this study, may be described as reluctant conscripts. A more realistic estimate of committed union members may be, in effect, about 25 per cent of the employed work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everything involved with this report, and the government's legislation, in terms of the value of that operation, is guaranteeing that group&mdash;the union bureaucracy&mdash;a place in doing deals for a very cynical work force. And, as we can see, most of them thought they joined the union to buy a job. I think that is one of the more disgraceful aspects of Australia today&mdash;the fact that people are still obliged to buy a job. In fact, coming back to those truckies, I have seen them come back to the industry four and five years later and be obliged to get a union ticket in order to pick up a load. They are then told that they owe five years of union dues, because when they were last in the union they did not write a letter withdrawing from the union. I think that too is outrageous. They had to buy a job at a price of $1,500 to $2,000. I think that that is an issue that might be the subject of a parliamentary inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As usual, you could drive a truck through the comments made by the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). The only example he could use of people who might be affected by workplace reform was that of the six-foot muscle bound truckie. The report we are talking about&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enterprise bargaining in Australia&mdash;</EMPHASIS>summarises the issue up to December 1994 and it has some important findings for the new industrial relations measures that are being brought in by this government. I would like to refer to the report that we are debating today. I think some of the gains made are important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the findings of the report suggest that the period covered by the first report was characterised by a significant growth in enterprise and workplace agreements, particularly in the federal industrial relations system and in the service sector, with bargaining spreading across a large number of industries to cover a majority of employees in the federal system. Workplaces with new federal agreements were distinguished from other forms of agreement, because they were likely to deal with more issues, more likely to reward employees for putting in extra effort and hours, less likely to exclude groups of employees from their agreement, more likely to result in consistent wage increases for all employees, more likely to be seen by women and part-timers as giving them a fair chance to have a say in bargaining and more likely to be seen by women and part-timers as making them better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was in comparison, of course, with formal agreements in state industrial relations systems; the new federal agreements have advantages. To quote from the summary report, the federal agreements:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. had greater coverage, and more effective representation of male and female employees</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. were perceived as showing generally better outcomes in terms of productivity, product quality and reliability, performance against external standards, operating costs and profitability</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. were less likely to record a deterioration in management/union cooperation as perceived by employees</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. were more likely to provide pay increases for employees, especially female and part-time employees</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. were less likely to be perceived by employees as having made them worse off.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the report also notes some general dissatisfaction with workplace change. This was referred to in comments made by Mark Davis, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, in response to the report. In spite of some of the very positive gains that the report mentions, to quote Mark Davis's report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outcome of workplace change is often viewed negatively by employees, particularly in places where management fails to consult with its workforce.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, obviously, a key issue of enterprise bargaining. There has to be effective consultation between management and workers. He goes on, in his review of the report, to say this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While collective agreements are estimated to cover 69 per cent of employees under the federal system, they cover only 21 per cent of the entire workforce because of the lower penetration of bargaining in workplaces regulated by State industrial systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report found that the most common workplace changes introduced last year were new technology, changes in work organisation, new training opportunities and employee performance appraisal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report says negative perceptions amongst employees reflect an "intensification" of work and higher levels of pressure on workers, with most employees saying they were putting more effort into their jobs than in the past.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that that is a key issue. Certainly, we recognise that the really quite radical changes made to the workplace&mdash;through enterprise bargaining and, in many workplaces, through structural changes&mdash;have resulted in a rise in concern, not only about future job satisfaction, but also about security of employment. That has also come out of the recession. To quote, again, from the summary report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A particular area of concern arose from evidence of employee dissatisfaction on several issues across all types of workplaces, whether or not they had agreements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. there was a significant decline in satisfaction with management, perceptions of weakening job security, widespread increases in stress and growing dissatisfaction with employees' ability to balance work and family life</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. employees were almost as likely to think that workplace changes had made them worse off, as better off&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>so it is about fifty-fifty on that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. attitudes to workplace bargaining were more positive than attitudes to workplace change more generally, with employees in workplaces with new federal agreements substantially more likely to report they were better off than worse off because of workplace bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA>While there is obviously this background of widespread concern about the changes that are happening in the culture of many workplaces&mdash;with many entrenched attitudes having to change and with concern about the future and job security&mdash;the evidence would indicate that, in fact, the enterprise bargaining arrangements that we have put in place have had a significant effect on the confidence of workers to feel that they can actually negotiate more effective arrangements with employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that involves the ability to handle the arrangements. Certainly, one of the key factors, as I have said in speeches before, is the ability of management to consult effectively, because we now have much more on-line, face-to-face arrangements in workplaces. We should remind ourselves that our Industrial Relations Act now covers certified agreements&mdash;negotiated between employers and unions representing employees&mdash;and enterprise flexibility agreements, or EFAs, made directly between an employer and employees, provided that the majority of employees approve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important and very significant for workers to remember that the major difference between ourselves and the opposition is that underpinning these quite radical changes is a commitment to an award safety net provision. It is important for us to remind ourselves of what those particular award safety net conditions are. They include minimum weekly wage rates; overtime and penalty rates; relevant leave loadings, for example casual leave loadings; four weeks annual leave; parental leave at test case standards; cumulative sick leave; two to three days bereavement leave; jury leave; the 38-hour week; termination, change and redundancy at test case standards; superannuation; public holidays; union right of entry; dispute settlement procedures; equal pay; and industry appropriate standards which vary from industry to industry. </PARA>

From what we can understand from their public comments, what is left of Jobsback is rigid and will be seen not to have changed. But we can specify that the only part of the award that the opposition is prepared to support is a single unspecified minimum hourly wage rate for adults, and another for juniors; four weeks annual leave; 12 months unpaid leave for natural mothers; and 10 days non-cumulative sick leave.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And occupational health and safety. We will include that, and I thank my colleague from the opposition benches. There is a major difference between the government and the opposition. What we have delivered under the Accord is a commitment to the no-disadvantage test so that, when workers go into a bargaining situation, they know that they will have access to advice from their union delegates and they know that, while they are negotiating increased productivity trade-offs for increases in wages and conditions, there will be a bottom line that will not be affected. And the evidence indicates, from those that have been registered in the federal system, that they simply have not been add-ons to the award provisions, but have been genuinely striven-for improvements to the awards; and we have actually had increases in productivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the general situation, workers have to be very clear that, if they are to be seduced by the generalised and insubstantial rhetoric from the opposition, they will be cutting away their award conditions and the safety net. That is very important. I gather that the opposition spokesperson, Mr Reith, has suggested that the coalition will introduce a no-disadvantage test. But we are not really sure what it will mean. It will not be a safeguard on award conditions but, as the minister said, a trapdoor to lower wages and employment conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid to say that I do not feel reassured by the shadow spokesperson on industrial relations. He is the architect of Jobsback, the GST and other things, and I do not believe the Australian work force, at the end of the day, will be prepared to jettison what has been built up over a 12-year period: an Accord that has delivered wage security, low-inflation and sustained economic growth, and which has delivered two million jobs in the last 12 years and a substantial improvement to our whole economy. That is what is going to make the difference for workers and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to indicate that our industrial relations policy has delivered the lowest level of industrial disputes in 50 years, even under collective bargaining with a sanction-free bargaining period. We have 60 per cent of federal award workers now covered by enterprise agreements with productivity offsets and four to five per cent annual wage increases. Under the Industrial Relations Reform Act and the Accord we have been able to decentralise the wage system while maintaining fairness in the process. Part of that is to make Australia a more productive, cooperative and competitive society. That is what is going to deliver advantages to families. All the rhetoric in the headland speeches will not change that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking with some of my coalmining constituents recently on a visit out west, the following point was made to me. I think it is pretty telling. A comrade said, `Look, in the 1970s and the early part of the 1980s, I spent more time out on the grass than down the pit because we were forever battling with management. In the lifetime of the Labor government I've been able to get on with the job at my workplace. We've negotiated massive workplace reform without the necessity for prolonged disputes.' Honourable members may remember that the current Leader of the Opposition was the architect of the housing dispute that saw coal workers out on the grass for weeks on end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have often said, the coalminers of Blackwater have not forgotten the fact that John Howard precipitated a riot. They have not forgotten it; they have very long memories. The coalminer that I was talking to said, `I don't want to spend the next five to 10 years out on the grass. I would like to complete my working life and then retire and have the benefits of the wages and conditions that my union, the CFMEU, the mining division, have been able to negotiate for me with management.' Coal workers have provided huge changes and made major differences to the productivity of that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are still working on the AMH dispute.

Just as I suspect my state colleagues do not go home gleeful when they find themselves obliged to exercise government restraint, so I want to reassure the Main Committee that the objectives that the government has for employee and employer relationships are largely reflected by the opposition. Sometimes I suspect the opposition is wrongly seen as simply reflecting the view of employers. In fact, it is made up of a group of people who want good employment relationships and good employment conditions for employees in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the great risk of boring you, since I suspect you heard this remark from me in the House of Representatives chamber earlier this week, I would point out to the Main Committee that what the government and the opposition have in common when it comes to enterprise bargaining and employer-employee relationships is one very significant factor: not that the government represents employees and the opposition represents employers&mdash;which is nonsense&mdash;but that we all happen to be parents of children who are seeking employment in Australia. I no more want my children caught up in an exploitative time frame and exploitative work conditions than anyone in the government wants theirs in that position. I have vested an interest in continuing good employee-employer relationships in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Capricornia has suggested, as government members sometimes do, that the government has some sort of monopoly on enterprise bargaining and employer-employee relationships. I pick up the comments by the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I suspect that the whole concept of enterprise bargaining was in existence long before the present agreements were in place. The whole concept of enterprise bargaining is, frankly, something that suits the Australian workplace and the Australian work ethic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own experience in rural industries, shearers have always been a part of some form of enterprise bargaining. They choose to work on a contract rather than at an hourly rate because of the opportunities for remuneration that that offers them. I know that is particularly true in the transport area, as alluded to by the member for O'Connor. Transport drivers deliberately choose to enter into a trip rate rather than an hourly rate arrangement. They deliberately choose transport operators who will pay them above the award. And they deliberately choose to enter into some form of loose enterprise bargaining so they can negotiate such things as back loading in order to maximise their return. The operator is pleased to entertain them because he wants that truck loaded and because, frankly, enterprising employees are the very people he wants to employ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not one who suggests that out there in the workplace there are not some trucking operators who would be exploitative, given half a chance. Of course, there are. Sadly, that is part of human nature. But they are in the minority. Furthermore, I have witnessed&mdash;I could not say first-hand because I have never been a truck operator but I had produce on the truck that was affected&mdash;the retaliation of employees who have felt that a particular truck operator was in some way being exploitative. I well recall getting a phone message to the effect that the tomatoes that I had produced and that I thought were on a truck destined for the Melbourne market were bound for Hobart, across the ocean, and were about to be left in Hobart. The truck driver had chosen in his own retaliatory way, having got to Melbourne and feeling that he was being exploited by the truck operator, to put that truck on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Empress of Tasmania</EMPHASIS> and leave it there. That did not please me and it did not please the transport operator, and I guess it is a very poor illustration of enterprise bargaining, but I applauded the determination shown by that particular employee to hold an exploitative employer to ransom. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems not to suit the government to recognise that on this side of the House there is widespread recognition of the value of unions. All that we are saying, in reflecting on this report, is that the concept of enterprise bargaining is not of itself something new. In fact, particularly in rural industries, enterprise bargaining has been a fact of life for years. As someone who came out of a labour intensive rural industry, I can indicate to the Main Committee that as a business we always paid above the award because we wanted to, because we wanted to keep in place our valued employees who were making a real contribution to the business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, while the member for Capricornia suggested that the member for O'Connor had only been successfully involved in enterprise bargaining because the truck drivers with whom he was negotiating were six feet tall and three feet across, that is not quite fair of the member for Capricornia. The reality is that I have been engaged in enterprise bargaining with grape pickers who were as petite as the member for Capricornia and were still successful bargaining operators because they knew that I had a crop that I wanted to pick, and I knew that they had the capacity to be cheerful employees and I would happily pay above the award in order to achieve that sort of cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was an unstructured form of enterprise bargaining. The concept of enterprise bargaining, far from being something on which the government has a monopoly, is something with which the opposition is entirely comfortable. It is wrong to create the impression of a them and us mentality about enterprise bargaining. The opposition is not anti-union and, frankly, we are anxious to enter into the sort of cooperation with employees keen to work that enables the total enterprise in Australia to be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current enterprise bargaining agreements in Australia tend to take two forms: either certified agreements between the unions and the employers, or enterprise flexibility arrangements which are entered into between the employers and the employees. The significance of the secondary one is not that unions are excluded but that there is an opportunity for employers and employees to enter into independent negotiations if they so choose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not seek to exclude employees from any of these arrangements. In fact, as I interjected to assist the member for Capricornia, the opposition seeks to ensure that existing minimum wage arrangements are retained, that occupational health and safety arrangements are retained. We have never walked away from the obligation that all employers should have to pay overtime, leave loading, annual leave and sick leave, and never has the opposition suggested that the superannuation arrangements currently being negotiated should in some way be abandoned if the opposition were to come to power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are comfortable with the concept of enterprise bargaining and with the arrangements that have been entered into and we welcome the opportunity for employees to choose whether they enter into an arrangement assisted and represented by their union or whether they enter into an arrangement in their own right. Furthermore, one of the things that ought to be celebrated by all Australians is the fact that in this nation, under the present government, we have a safety net that ensures that exploitation, while it can still occur&mdash;Blind Freddy would agree with that&mdash;at least is minimised because society at large says that everyone should be entitled to some form of safety net if employment is not available to them. No-one in the opposition has ever suggested that that safety net should be pruned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long it has been too easy for government members to suggest that opposition members simply sit here seeking a chance to be exploitative in the way they deal with employees. Frankly, in my own experience and in the experience of those colleagues with whom I have spoken on both sides of the House, I think that is a quite unfair misrepresentation of what it is that motivates the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have but one desperate plea as a member of the parliament and as someone involved in the debate on industrial relations, and that is to ensure that we do not put in place those requirements that are a deliberate disincentive to employers to employ people, because I consider the exploitation of unemployment is also something that every Australian should be conscious of. In unintentionally making it more difficult to employ people, we instantly ensure that those people live lives that therefore are less purposeful than would be the case if they were in employment. The member for O'Connor has made the point that there are 800,000 small businesses in Australia and that if in fact they were able to employ more people that would mean a more competitive and productive economy, and there would be a real impact made on the existing levels of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my concluding remarks, I will quote briefly from the report. In the conclusion to the summary of the report, reflecting on what the public servants dealing with enterprise bargaining in Australia have achieved, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the changes that were observed, for better or worse, in Australian workplaces were changes that would have occurred anyway&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I think that is significant&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But it also appeared that there were some patterns that distinguished Part VIB agreements from other types of agreements, and these comparisons were summarised in the conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part VIB workplaces, compared to other non-VIB agreement workplaces, were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.more likely to reward employees for putting in extra effort or hours;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.less likely to exclude groups of employees from the agreement; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.less likely to provide for different rates of pay rises for employees covered by agreements.</PARA>
<PARA>Those objectives are ones which both opposition and government would laud. The concept of enterprise bargaining is not of itself a unique panacea. Rather, it reflects the way in which Australians generally would like to enter into agreements between employers and employees in order to maximise the productivity of the workplace. That additional productivity augurs well for the future of the balance of payments figure in Australia and for the opportunity to have a more competitive and more lucrative Australia in which all Australians will want to live. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are here today to talk about the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enterprise bargaining in Australia</EMPHASIS>, but first I would like to take up some of the points that have been made by those opposite. On occasion, on both sides of this chamber we resort to rhetoric in respect to the positions of our opponents and also we possibly laud our own positions; however, there are a few issues I would like to take up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) is still here, I would like to address some of his comments. I do not think that, generally, on this side of the House there is a view that the opposition&mdash;in terms of the views of individual members of the coalition&mdash;is totally anti-worker, or that it wants to drive down working conditions. I have friends who are members of the coalition whom I respect in terms of their commitment to the views that they hold and their basic wishes for this society. However, the question really gets down to the results of policies. The question also gets down to just what the policies are. In terms of the Liberal Party, and of the coalition as a whole, we have to look at what its policy has been in the past and what its policy is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Elements of that policy are now being dragged out&mdash;and it is almost like pulling teeth&mdash;with respect to industrial relations. They have made a commitment to the no-disadvantage clause, although to an extent it is rather vague in comparison to the existing government's position. Historically, in terms of Jobsback, the coalition also has a position on things like the basic reduction and erosion of award conditions, with, for example, the $3 an hour award wage proposed by the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conservative coalition governments in various state jurisdictions are also doing some fairly extreme things. Their intention may not be for those actions to have extreme results but, coming from Victoria, and not wishing to labour the point about the Premier, the fact is that when you look at what is occurring in Victoria with respect to ordinary workers, and the conditions they face when they go to work every day, there has been a real impact. People come into my office every day of the week, as they do to the offices of members opposite. I do not know whether only people associated with the Labor Party come to my office and only people associated with the coalition go to their offices, but we seem to be hearing very different stories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite often, people come to my office who are in a situation where they have been subjected to a form of abuse with respect to their working position because of changes in the state award system which have severely impacted upon them and their families&mdash;even with respect to their take-home pay. Certainly, when I speak about the question of the coalition's policies with respect to these issues and their result, I bear no ill will to the members opposite in personal terms. What I worry about is the actual result of those policies. No matter how well founded they may be in terms of theory and no matter how well founded they may be in terms of the members' personal views and their ideology, the fact is that, as we see happening in states like Victoria and Western Australia, those policies are just not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would take up another comment by the member for Wakefield with respect to his example about the truck being left on the boat. I can also quote some examples of personal experiences when I was working on a station in New South Wales, longer ago than I care to remember. The circumstances were that I was driving a tractor and I was getting three bucks an hour. I found out subsequently, about six months later, that every other worker on every other farm in the surrounding districts was getting five bucks an hour. The only way I was able to address that issue was to pull on my own personal little strike at the time we were about to plant the wheat, and that was quite effective. I guess it could be called enterprise bargaining; I guess that at the time I saw it as being militant industrial action on an individual basis. In those circumstances it did work, and in those circumstances it was necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The person I was employed by was not a bad fellow, but the view he had related to his circumstances and the position that he held with respect to the business. The circumstance with many employers is not that they are bad&mdash;and I do not think that they are&mdash;but that they have a very clear and abiding commitment to their business and to what they are doing. That tends to give them a perspective which relates to their position and that is understandable&mdash;it is totally understandable. However, the question is: does that in the end mean a result which can be worse for workers than it should be? The answer there, I think, is yes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also when we look at the question of what is seen as a fair and reasonable claim, whether it be through enterprise bargaining or through other forms of action or negotiation, the fact is that it is always better to look back, and see what was fair or unfair historically&mdash;to see how unfair it really was&mdash;rather than looking forward. Historical claims are always easier to understand and to accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had numerous occasions where, in years gone by, as a union official dealing with employers, I have had the argument put to me, `But we can't afford this.' That is often the case: no argument, that is often the case. But on quite a few occasions, in circumstances where we have reached an agreement on the basis of what the employer said was something that was not sustainable, I have gone back to that workplace 12 months later or whatever, and the fact is that it has been affordable and it has been achievable. The employer often is prepared to agree that was in fact the case, but then give you the same answer about any future claim you may make. Again, that is understandable from their position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the circumstances of the individual truck driver and the boat, I guess that enterprise bargaining in the more formal sense, as this agreement discusses, is about avoiding those sorts of circumstances. It is about having a situation where, if an employer and an employee do negotiate on a formal basis, we know what the ground rules are, we know where we stand. The circumstances are then that we do not have forms of industrial action of that nature taking place, or, if they are taking place, certainly they are on a much reduced level. That is one of the successes of the government's industrial relations reforms over the years&mdash;and they have evolved in various ways&mdash;that there has been a major decrease, a historical low in industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there are other issues relating to that. There is also the question of the overall impact of the recessionary period; there is also the impact of job losses in particular industries. That has all, I suppose, created additional fear in people's minds about maintaining their jobs, and about their willingness perhaps to take action. It has also meant that areas of the work force that are traditionally not heavily unionised have grown while others have decreased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing a situation, over the last three years or so as the recovery has occurred, and as employment has improved in many of those industries, where industrial action is still at a historical low. I do not think you can say it is one or the other totally, but I think that there has to be some recognition given to the fact that the government's accord process, the negotiations and the reforms within industrial relations have had an impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the member for Wakefield and the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) commented that enterprise bargaining has always occurred. Agreed. No doubt about that. I guess I would say that much of what we do in this place&mdash;and I think it is the intention of both sides in terms of their beliefs&mdash;is regulate, to an extent, the operation of the economy. There are arguments about how far that regulation goes, and there are also circumstances where different variations on the theme occur. But the fact of the matter is that we are partly about trying to regulate the operation of society, and the circumstances of enterprise bargaining are such that there has to be a situation where there are more formalised approaches taken in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issue is not the question of the six-foot truck drivers, or the very articulate smaller people who are, in fact, able to use their skills to good effect with reasonable or sometimes unreasonable employers. A work force is a very varied and different area, and people often require those sorts of regulations and rules in there to assist with the processes of agreements with employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a former union official and, I suppose, someone who has followed the classic sort of hack development that is often pointed out by the coalition with respect to Labor Party politicians&mdash;not that is has done me that much good&mdash;I have often dealt with employees whose real problem has been a lack of knowledge with respect to their rights and a lack of understanding about how they work. I am sure that has been the experience of those opposite also. In those circumstances there is a need to articulate those views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a situation such as the one in Victoria, where basically the guts of the rule book have been thrown out, the end result is that employees feel even more exposed, more unsure of what they are entitled to and more able to be taken advantage of, often by people who, I stress, are not seeking to take advantage of them. The employees are merely in the competitive environment of industrial relations, which has existed for an awful long time. They are endeavouring to maximise their own benefits from an involvement in the productive process while employers are about trying to maximise the benefit to them and their business with respect to profits and therefore income. That is understandable, but it does require regulations for the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enterprise bargaining in Australia</EMPHASIS> report is the first comprehensive review of developments in bargaining at the enterprise and workplace level. It covers a nine-month period from 30 March to 31 December 1994. The report was prepared by the Department of Industrial Relations and draws on several sources of information, including the department's formalised federal workplace agreements database, which contains information on federal enterprise agreements formalised by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which commenced operation in the period under review. The workplace bargaining survey 1994, which is the largest work based survey of both managers and employees undertaken in Australia to date, conducted nationally at 1,060 Australian workplaces with 10 or more employees, was another source of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research was conducted within and outside the department, including an analysis of transcripts and decisions from Australian Industrial Relations Commission hearings. Consultations were conducted for the report with a broad range of organisations with an interest in enterprise bargaining, including employer organisations, the ACTU and unions, groups representing women and ethnic communities, other community organisations and relevant government agencies. There was also consultation with the sex discrimination commission and the Affirmative Action Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report reviews developments under part VIB of the federal IR Act which has two types of enterprise agreements: certified agreements negotiated between employers and unions and enterprise flexibility agreements made directly between an employer and his or her employees, provided a majority of employees approve. The report concentrates on developments in the federal sphere but does provide some comparative data on workplaces in the formal state systems and workplaces with unregistered agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of messages come out of the report. I will be brief, given that I have probably spent too much time discussing the comments of previous speakers. The first message is that overall the extra protections for employees introduced through our legislation are having a positive effect. Bargaining under our federal system is fairer for employees. The comparative data within the report shows that, compared with other forms of agreement, new federal agreements are more likely to result in wage increases for all employees, and that women and part-timers have seen it as giving them a fairer chance to have a say within the process. More employees in workplaces with new federal agreements, some 63 per cent, had received a wage increase in the previous 12 months than had employees in other types of workplaces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second message from the report is that the federal system not only is fairer but also is delivering better coverage. We have seen a significant increase in agreement making in the federal IR system and, through that process, by protecting employees, the government's reforms are helping to boost employee participation in and confidence in bargaining. That will have a result with respect to the quality of work and industry undertaken through business, and that will have a better result for the economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system is delivering good economic results, with 96 per cent of agreements including at least one provision to improve productivity at the workplace and provisions relating to hours of work, training and work organisation found in the majority of agreements. Compared with unregistered agreements, new formal federal agreements were more likely to have received wage increases based on productivity, and nearly 80 per cent of workplaces with new federal agreements reported an increase in productivity in the previous 12 months. It is starting to show results, and I think results which go past the anecdotal discussions of, say, the member for O'Connor earlier today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also shows that a number of people who were critical of these reforms at the time have in fact been proved to be wrong. In the lead up to the Industrial Relations Reform Act, some employer groups and conservative commentators said that giving employers the right to strike when negotiating a certified agreement through a sanction-free bargaining period, taking the secondary boycott provisions out of the Trade Practices Act and dealing with secondary boycotts through the Industrial Relations Act would lead to a massive increase in industrial disputation. That just has not happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another argument, which was put by the ACCI and others, was that the federal agreements were just meaningless, that they would be add-ons to awards and in that way, clearly, are wrong. But, again, a review of the agreements that have been reached show that, arguably, only a small number appear to be simply add-ons. The circumstances were that agreements from the perspective of workplace managers were seen to have represented a complete settlement of the package of pay and conditions that ought to apply in a workplace or enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of those agreements involved an overall restructuring of someone's award conditions but often the agreement addressed particular issues that were a particular problem with respect to that business. I had the experience, as an official in years gone by, where often the argument from an employer would be, `It's this issue I want to fix. The rest I can live with. It's okay.' That is what has been addressed through this process. Overall, the report is a handy document with respect to the changes that have occurred. It shows that the reforms are moving in the right direction. I commend it to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a few remarks about the 1994 annual report on enterprise bargaining in Australia. It is interesting listening to members opposite speaking on the topic of industrial relations. The accusation of course comes out, as it inevitably did then, that some members on our side are inherently anti-worker. We would of course strongly dispute that. What we are in fact is pro-Australia. It is quite clear that the industrial regime is absolutely critical to the future of Australia. The reason why we in Australia have dragged the chain so much in terms of the restructuring of our economy is simply that the government of the last 12 years has been hamstrung to a very large extent by its relations with the unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need to look any further than that as one of the major reasons why the restructuring of the Australian economy has been so slow&mdash;although there has been an increasing realisation on the other side of politics that it needs to be done. To their credit, I think some of the leadership of the Labor Party do know what needs to be done. I notice that the president of the Labor Party, the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), is here this morning. Certainly, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I think, understands what needs to be done, as do some of his ministers. However, it has been made quite clear time and time again that they have been unable to deliver because they can go only as far as the union movement&mdash;the union leadership in particular&mdash;allows them to go. There is a fundamental conflict of interest within the Australian Labor Party and because of that they will never be able to deliver the structural reform of the Australian economy that the times demand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We could talk about the Fraser government. The caravan has moved on so far since 1983. I accept the criticism of many aspects of the Fraser government, but the fact is that in the last 10 years, when there needed to be an accelerated rate of change, the Labor Party has not been anywhere up to delivering that rate of change, in a world where there has been a realisation that there has been a rapid rate of change. Let us look at our Asian neighbours. In Singapore, for instance, the standard of living has doubled&mdash;however that is measured&mdash;every 10 years since the 1960s.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Labor Party knew the directions that had to be taken. However, it has not been able to deliver and this report indicates that quite clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report talks about the quantity of change. That was my impression in reading through it. On that measure, on the quantity of change, it looks very good. It is able to report, as the minister has reported in the parliament, about the extent of the coverage of the work force by enterprise agreements. When it gets down to the actual facts, it talks about quantity rather than quality of change. It has been at that level that the government has been incapable of delivering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate on these issues is largely stifled by the fact that the government has been hamstrung in its relations with the union movement. In the debate on industrial relations in the main chamber yesterday, I pointed to the cosy relationship that exists between the Labor Party and the union movement. Actually, it is more than cosy; it is quite incestuous. The extent of financial support given by the government to the unions is remarkable. In the last 12 years, between $130 million and $140 million of taxpayers' money has effectively been given to the unions by virtue of direct grants and tax concessions. All legally&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not got those facts in front of me; I am just recalling them from yesterday. Government patronage of the union movement exists to that extent. The other side of the picture is more alarming because it is actually a two-way street. Prior to the 1993 election, the ACTU received grants of $1.3 million from the government for a whole range of purposes. It does not really matter whether or not it is called training&mdash;a lot of it is fairly specious. At least, on the face of it, it is not illegal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the ACTU put $1.2 million into its campaign against the coalition at the 1993 election. Almost all the money it received in grants from the government was used against the coalition. The extent of the patronage that exists between the Labor Party and the trade union movement is such that, at that level, it is really a matter of the one who pays the piper calling the tune. That is why this country has been largely hamstrung in the area of industrial relations over the last 12 years. We are accused of being anti-worker but the government has operated in the interests of a small sector of the Australian community, the trade union leadership and some of their apparatchiks, to the great detriment of the majority of Australia and Australians, and that is the great pity of it. The government has been unable to deliver, other than in some quantitative sense, what was necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to back up a bit here and say that, quite remarkably, in about 1991, the government came to a realisation that it had missed the boat in terms of industrial relation reform. Let us remember that, up to that point, it was totally intransigent on enterprise bargaining. It was something that we had talked about on our side of politics for many years, although, as the member for Lalor observed, the timing was not right and nothing was done prior to 1983. That is when the whole process of change in our part of the world, in particular, accelerated, although it had been happening in parts of Asia prior to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that the government was finally dragged screaming to the realisation that there had to be a move into this new era of industrial relations. Prior to that, we were totally locked into the colonial system and the whole shebang, the whole box and dice, of arbitration and centralised wage fixing. The union movement realised too late that there had to be a change and the government was actually allowed&mdash;that is what it boiled down to&mdash;to go down that track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, I believe some of them knew that that was the way to go, and I pay credit to those who were smart enough to know it. I suspect that many others were smart enough to know it too, but their factions tell them&mdash;I do not know which faction the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) is in, but no doubt he is also told&mdash;how far to go down those tracks. The leadership of the trade union movement slowly woke up to the fact that they had to get with it and that they had no choice. So we have entered into this process of what amounts ultimately to a Claytons form of enterprise bargaining, because it has so many restrictions placed upon it&mdash;both legislative and otherwise&mdash;that it really is still failing today to deliver the pace of reform that the circumstances actually call for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rhetoric of the member for Corinella, who spoke before me about `Up the workers!' and all that sort of rhetoric that we still hear from members in the Labor Party, is really quite passe. In my view, it is something out of a bygone era. Ultimately, we have to come to a point where we must decide what is best for Australia and not what is best for a few trade union officials, particularly those who are in parliament. The member for Corinella admitted, and he is quite right, that Labor party members are so dominated because the government is comprised of former union officials. In my dealings with them, I learned this business at the coalface, in employing large numbers of people who were members of trade unions. I learned at a fairly young age what their real motivation actually was, but I also came to understand that trade union officials do not understand&mdash;not that they are incapable of it, but they choose not to understand&mdash;what the real world is actually about and what business is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even all of that has changed in recent years, because I think we are operating in a much more enlightened environment than we were when those sorts of conflicts actually were going on. There is now a much greater appreciation&mdash;by management in particular, but also by workers by and large&mdash;that ultimately everybody is better off and the cake actually becomes bigger through an appreciation of what our profits and sales are actually all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent report which showed that Australia was, in some senses, the wealthiest nation on earth should probably give us some comfort, but what it actually does is demonstrate, more clearly than anything else we have seen in recent times, the great gap that there is in this country between its potential and its actual performance. By almost every measure, our performance in economic terms is very poor. Ultimately, of course, our international competitiveness is the major problem that we are faced with in this country, in terms of making our way in the world with the ongoing balance of payments problems that we continue to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aims and objectives of the industrial relations legislation have been expressed as being to enable the spread of enterprise bargaining and the protection of employees' interests through the maintenance and strengthening of the award safety net. We come to an impasse in these sorts of debates when we talk about the status quo. The starting point for all of the negotiations, from the government's point of view and from the unions' point of view, has always been the status quo. It has always been assumed that, in some ways, that was the point to start at; whereas, quite clearly, in many respects it was not the point to start at. In fact, the safety net, as somebody observed the other day, rather than being a safety net had become a hammock for many employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need, of course, as we recognise on this side of the House, for a balance between what might be a free-for-all in enterprise bargaining in terms of a laissez-faire approach. But the emphasis on protection of employee interests has been very largely at the expense of employer interests and, ultimately, it is the employers who actually provide the jobs. You can only go on for so long biting the hand that feeds you before you realise that that will not work and that, indeed, it is not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that it is not working is reflected in the high levels of unemployment that we have had in recent years. Despite the very best attempts of the government to disguise that fact, clearly unemployment is on the rise again, even though the government has thrown millions of dollars at the problem by putting people onto all sorts of training schemes and giving them these new work opportunities, and so on. These are basically for the short term, to get them into a situation where they are at least not ostensibly unemployed. But the level of unemployment and underemployment in this country is huge. Realistically, taking the total level of unemployment and underemployment, we are probably looking at a figure closer to 15, 16 or even 20 per cent of the Australian work force, rather than the eight or so per cent that the official figures actually divulge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unfair dismissal legislation which we dealt with in the parliament yesterday&mdash;which the minister claimed was an improvement on a good system but which, in fact, was only a minor improvement on a very bad system&mdash;really does not help us at all to overcome these problems. In the end, employers will take the attitude, as they have the right to do, that if you cannot fire them, why would you be motivated to hire them? That effort alone has been another example of the incapacity of the Labor Party to handle the situation that exists. </PARA>

Some workers might think that wages have been kept too low, or whatever. But, if you look at it objectively, you can certainly see that what we have in this country is an industrial relations system which does work, where there is consensus, where there are benefits for both employers and employees, for unions and business alike, and where, most obviously of all, there is a huge decrease in the number of industrial disputes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enterprise bargaining in Australia</EMPHASIS> discusses progress in enterprise bargaining. Our enterprise bargaining system has a legislative background. The Industrial Relations Reform Act came into effect on 30 March last year. The act was designed to encourage enterprise bargaining, while providing guarantees to ensure that employees are treated fairly and cannot be disadvantaged by bargaining. That is in direct contrast with the opposition policies. We keep hearing that there are too many restrictions, legislative and otherwise, on enterprise bargaining. Those restrictions are there for a very good reason: to protect workers and ensure that people are not disadvantaged by bargains which are struck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the award system, the main elements of the legislation are: employees are protected by awards that set fair and enforceable minimum wages and conditions of employment that are maintained at a relevant level; the award safety net is strengthened by guaranteeing access for all workers to minimum entitlements relating to minimum wages; there is equal remuneration of work for equal value; there are conditions relating to termination of employment, including unfair dismissal&mdash;we hear a lot about that from the opposition&mdash;and there is the right to 12 months unpaid parental leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that any employer in this country has anything to fear. Any fair, sincere employer who follows due process has nothing to fear from unfair dismissal legislation. We have had so much hype and nonsense from the opposition, clearly for electoral reasons. Their scaremongering over this legislation seeks to alarm employers and to deter them from employing people. It is one of the most disgraceful disinformation campaigns I have seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody has anything to fear from due process. I am familiar with due process as it has been practised in the public sector over a long period of time. People should not be dismissed unfairly. They should be dismissed if they are not performing or if they do something wrong, such as stealing money. There are processes to allow that to happen. But to protest about the existence of unfair dismissal legislation is farcical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation includes minimum entitlements giving effect to International Labour Organisation and UN conventions. Other elements seek to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the basis of race, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability&mdash;I do not like the term `mental disability' as it appears in the legislation; it should be intellectual or psychiatric disability&mdash;marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin. These are basic equal opportunity provisions. The Industrial Relations Commission is also required to take account of ILO Convention 156 in performing its functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the bargaining stream the act provides for two types of enterprise agreements: certified agreements which are negotiated between employers and unions, and enterprise flexibility agreements, EFAs, which are made directly between an employer and his or her employees, provided that a majority of employees approve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind opposition members that I have not always followed the official government line on enterprise bargaining. Nor, for that matter, am I always in agreement with the official trade union line on enterprise bargaining. I was previously an active trade unionist in the public sector, and I recall that in the early 1990s, when enterprise bargaining was first on the agenda and debated, that there were many of us&mdash;particularly in the public sector, but right across the union movement&mdash;who were concerned about the likely effects of enterprise bargaining. I recall writing an article, which I circulated within my union, in which I expressed concerns about enterprise bargaining, particularly as it related to the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believed then that enterprise bargaining was a by-product of the economic rationalist culture that unfortunately seemed to dominate the government, and particularly central departments like Treasury, Finance and Industrial Relations. It also had its adherents, unfortunately, amongst the senior ranks of the ACTU and amongst many senior union officials around the country. I believed that enterprise bargaining had the potential to enable unionists and workers to be divided into bite sized chunks to make it easier for employers in the negotiating process. That came about because of the removal of the centralised wage fixing system, which a lot of us had seen as a safety net in itself over the years. Indeed, as this report recognises, there were fears that groups such as women, migrants, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, et cetera, could be disadvantaged through enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it ironic that this was happening in an era when the trade union movement was going through huge structural reform. This involved amalgamations and the formation of mega-unions, much of which was for reasons of efficiency. I agreed with most of the amalgamations although some of them have gone a tad too far now with these huge super-unions within which the rank and file tend to think they get lost. There are some problems with the extent to which amalgamations have gone but basically I agree with the philosophy of amalgamation of the myriad of unions that we had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it ironic that on the one hand you had an amalgamation of unions and on the other hand you had a push to divide up workers into enterprise groups for the purposes of bargaining. Nevertheless, it was recognised amongst my colleagues in the public sector that enterprise bargaining was here and that those who wanted to oppose enterprise bargaining had lost the battle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess where the debate hotted up in the public sector was on the issue of agency bargaining. Instead of the APS being the enterprise for enterprise bargaining, there was concern that we were going to be broken up into different agencies. It was feared that workers in different government departments would be subject to different bargains and different wage outcomes, et cetera. However, I am pleased to say that I have recently been informed that commonsense has prevailed in the public sector for basic wages and conditions negotiations. The APS is to be the agency and we will not have differential wage outcomes for public servants in different government departments. I think that would have been a bit of a farce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having made a few comments and having expressed my reservations when I was in the union movement about enterprise bargaining, I would have to say that at least under Labor's system of enterprise bargaining there are some safeguards in place, unlike what we could expect from a coalition government, as we have seen in various states around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the report. It points out quite clearly a number of messages. It points out that the extra protection for employees introduced through our legislation is having a positive effect and that bargaining under our federal system is fairer for employees as compared with other forms of agreements, particularly those put in place by state conservative governments. New federal agreements are more likely to reward employees for putting in extra hours and effort. Employees in workplaces with new federal agreements were least likely to report an increase in working hours but, where hours had gone up, employees were more likely than others to have also received an increase in weekly pay. That is, they were more likely to get a fair deal in the work effort bargain. Compared with other forms of agreements, new federal agreements were more likely to result in wage increases for all employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More employees in workplaces with new federal agreements, 63 per cent, had received a wage increase in the previous 12 months than had employees in other types of workplaces with other types of agreements. Compared with other types of agreements, new federal agreements were more likely to be seen by women and part-time workers as giving them a fair chance to have a say in workplace bargaining. In workplaces with new federal agreements, women said that they were consulted just as often as men were, but in workplaces under other types of agreements women were considerably less likely than men to have been consulted about bargaining and were less likely to say that they had had a fair chance to have a say in enterprise bargaining. Also, compared with other agreements, federal agreements were more likely to be seen by women and part-timers as making them better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report goes on to some other very important areas. The second key message from the report is that under the federal system these agreements are also delivering better coverage and that, because of the way in which the federal government industrial relations framework protects employees, workers feel more confident about entering into agreements. Consequently, there is a significant growth in enterprise and workplace agreements, particularly in the federal industrial relations system and in the services sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The take-up rate in the federal jurisdiction accelerated after the reform act took effect. There were over 1,450 new federal agreements formalised in the reporting period, more than doubling the rate of agreement making of the pre-reform act period. The majority of new federal agreements, that is, 76 per cent of those agreements, came from the private sector. We now have about 5,500 agreements formalised, covering 58 per cent of federal award covered employees. No wonder people are flocking from state awards to federal awards, particularly in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third key message is that these agreements are helping to encourage the spread of enterprise bargaining and helping to deliver good economic results. There is plenty of evidence of that around the country. We hear a lot from the other side and from the conservative media that these enterprise agreements will cause more industrial disputes. That is clearly wrong. As I said before, I cannot remember a significant federal industrial dispute since 1983. Once again, I think there is an element of scaremongering in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enterprise bargaining report is an interesting report. Although there are some sobering messages in it, which I do not have time to go into, at least under our system workers will be far better off than under the coalition, and they well know it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report says a great deal about a narrow subject and says nothing at all about a lot of the matters that we, as parliamentarians, should address. Fundamentally it does represent, yet again, something of the interface between the Labor Party and the trade union movement. It is sad for the Labor Party's sake, rather than for anybody else's sake, that they have not been able to look beyond that relationship. It is demonstrable, with a large number of employees voting with their feet by leaving the trade union movement, that there are increasingly persons who are not being represented by the relationship between the trade unions and the Labor Party, who traditionally would have seen their natural political alignment with that political force. The report tells a great deal about a narrow part of the subject but very little about where we are going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look at it, it makes me wonder whether there are not still fundamental problems in enterprise bargaining, although, from the perspective of the coalition, it is a far better means of negotiating wages and conditions than now exists. The changes that the Labor Party has introduced are still too narrow. There is too little flexibility and we need to look very carefully at what are the minimal conditions which need to be provided. I do not see that providing an arbitrary role for the trade union movement in negotiations, after an enterprise agreement has been negotiated and before ratification is in any way advancing the cause of good relations and harmony in the workplace. Nor does it go towards addressing the overall question of whether or not enterprise bargaining is a better way to achieve productivity in industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamentally, the problem we have in Australia is that we have a lot of unemployed. What the government fails to understand is that enterprise bargaining should be looking both at the way by which you can employ people and people can be employed to the mutual advantage of each and, at the same time, at how you can make the whole of the workplace more effective and more productive and you can get more jobs. The more complications and the more difficulties there are in aspects of your industrial relations administration, the harder it is, particularly for small business employers, to employ people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a good deal of discussion in the parliament of the degree to which the unfair dismissal provisions now apply and how people can be dismissed&mdash;whether or not they are able, in a small business, to be dismissed on the grounds of a person's unsatisfactory behaviour or aspects related to personal incompatibility. All these complications make it harder and harder for small business to employ people and I do not believe that in the rigidity of enterprise bargaining, as it is now structured under part VIB of the Industrial Relations Act 1988, there is sufficient flexibility to address that question with the overall public good in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect that worries me is whether or not, in the overall relationship between the parties, there is enough treatment given to labour on-costs. If we are looking at one of the real disincentives against employment today, it is not how much an employee receives but how much his particular place costs the employer and, consequently, the extent to which that person is far more expensive to the employer than immediately is apparent. The total labour package is far more than the wage paid to the employees. As we have seen in international comparisons, in many instances Australian workers are not overpaid, but the labour on-costs are excessive and consequently there are major difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem that I see in the report is that that sector of the community that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, and I represent, the rural community, does not have as much of a part in enterprise bargaining as larger corporations. To my mind, it has always been a problem with Labor that they have looked at big business and big unions as being a way by which big government can flourish and they can flourish with it. In rural Australia it is the individual rather than collective bargaining force that is so often important. It seemed to me, when enterprise bargaining was first mooted, that there was a significant advantage in our being able to develop the concept of being able to once again relate the person who is in charge of a business to the person who is employed in the business, and come out with a negotiated arrangement which takes account of the whole framework within which they are employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In rural Australia, so often the conditions vary from region to region, state to state and property to property. Enterprise bargaining tends to take account of the power of a collective trade union, so that if you are looking at award conditions affecting the shearing industry, for example, they are not negotiable between an individual who operates his or her own woolshed and the people who work in that shed; they are negotiated on a much wider basis. In that climate, I do not know that you necessarily provide the conditions that are best suited to the particular enterprise. It is for that reason again that I have reservations about the present structure of enterprise bargaining within the presently worded part VIB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that there be enormous flexibility in workplace arrangements. It is important not to continue the old division that used to exist. It ensured that, where there were negotiations around the terms and conditions of employment, they seemed to take place between an industrial relations officer of a company and a trade union official. I felt they were unsatisfactory. It is far better having an arrangement where the people are involved in the workplace and the person who owns the business or is managing the business can actually talk to the people who are on the work floor. Unless you can achieve that, too often the conditions do not relate to a particular enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all reflected in the fact that, in this report, there is a good deal of comment about the impact of part VIB, on employees and on particular minority groups, all of whom are significant and all of whom are important. There is no real consideration of the impact of part VIB on employment generally or its impact on employers or productivity. It tends to focus on the old battleground of two classes, and I suggest that these are now archaic. It is no longer just a matter of employer and employee. It is a matter of public good and public benefit and productivity and how to deal with the unemployed. It is matter of getting people back into the work force, albeit perhaps under different terms and conditions. These things are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, when looking at this report, it has to be remembered that there are still about one million Australians out of work, including people on various make work programs. A very large percentage of the total work force is totally excluded from enterprise bargaining. Nothing in enterprise bargaining, in this report and in the legislation that Labor has framed, provides the opportunity for people out of work to get back into the work force. Unless it identifies what it will do for business to improve our productivity, to make us more competitive&mdash;with total quality management and all these other facets of competition&mdash;unfortunately, enterprise bargaining is going to form only a small part of the total analysis of how a particular enterprise works and its efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to the report to address a couple of aspects. Page xxxi of the summary headed `The impact of part VIB agreements on employees' mentions that the average annual wage increase of employees covered by part VIB of the agreement was in the order of four per cent. It suggests that is a fairly significant achievement. To my mind, one of the difficulties with that is that it is not just in wage increases that one should assess the benefits to an enterprise. I think there are all sorts of other facets which are really important&mdash;for instance, the likelihood of the job being a permanent job; the extent to which the workplace itself is a better workplace than it was before; the extent to which the person's take home pay is increased. A wage increase, more often than not under our PAYE system&mdash;the taxation applied by the Labor government&mdash;means that a person's pay is significantly different from the amount the person puts in his pocket at the end of the week, the fortnight or the month. For that reason, the measure of comparison is not necessarily right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 73 of the main report, 3.3, `Union involvement in enterprise flexibility agreements', is another one of the real downsides. If there is a negotiated agreement without the union initially being involved, the unions are automatically given, under this sell-out between the government and the ACTU, a right to intervene. I know there are circumstances where employees may be disadvantaged by the relative bargaining strength they exercise against management and the employer, and it is important that that be recognised. But it does not apply universally and, too often, on the basis of a negotiated arrangement, there has not been full account taken of the opportunity of a particular business to stay in business. If the union has the capacity to intervene in every instance, it does not look at the capacity of the business to survive or at the overall conditions within that particular business place to the same degree that it looks at whether or not its own members or the extended membership is advantaged or disadvantaged by that particular agreement. I am afraid that self-interest by the trade union movement, in many instances, has meant that its membership has suffered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned page 205, `Impact on employees&mdash;overview', when I was talking about the lack of matters that are identified within the report. In my mind, it is not just a matter of the impact on employees that is important. I think you have got to look at a far wider subject, and I regret that has not been taken up anywhere in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, looking at the section headed `Management and unions', I think we have to understand that it is not just a matter of relative bargaining skills; it is a matter of relative advantage. I do not think relative advantage necessarily flows from the way in which this report has been addressed. On page 298 in section 6.9, there is a comment I just want to refer to before I close. The second paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the report has highlighted some areas that will need to be addressed in future reports, particularly issues for non-English speaking background employees, provisions under Part VIB appear to have also generally promoted fairer outcomes for employees than might otherwise have been the case.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that shows that, if we had a proper enterprise bargaining system without the undue restraints which Labor has imposed on it, the concept is right. Unfortunately, I do not believe that what has been introduced under part VIB by the present Labor administration is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That that is so is illustrated by the intervention of the federal government in a particular enterprise bargaining arrangement I noted in the paper yesterday, where I understand a work force have decided that they are no longer going to take sick leave and have negotiated a wage increase in order to compensate for it. They have done it on a totally fair and open-minded basis; they have done it to get more pay; and now the federal government is intervening to disrupt that enterprise arrangement. I do not think that is fair. I do not think it is desirable. I think it illustrates, yet again, the failure of enterprise bargaining under the Labor structured changes to industrial relations legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just deal with a couple of points that the previous speaker, the member for New England (Mr Sinclair), dealt with. One was that he said people were leaving their trade unions. That is not correct. People may not be joining trade unions, but that is because of a different work situation in Australia with different situations and different ways of working, the increase in part-time and casual work and a whole change in the industrial work force of the country. The change has resulted in less manufacturing employment and a move to a whole range of different jobs which have never traditionally involved organised labour. That is basically why there has been a decline in union membership in the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting that the member for New England raised issues about shearing sheds and said that we could have different rates from one shearing shed to another. That would be a very interesting concept, with one shearer shearing alongside another shearer and one being paid more than another. It is a different matter when it is a learner and a shearer. But it will be a very interesting time if different rates are introduced into the country, between one shed and another, and there will be a very interesting argument when the shearers might all live 500 miles away and we are relating it to the actual negotiated position on a particular shed. I find that a pretty fascinating position. It basically comes down to an individual bargain and an individual contract being struck on the job. It will be an interesting time if we ever get to that in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That also brings me to the point that I believe you get to the lowest common denominator with that sort of approach. That is, one contractor applies for a contract and, as that contractor winds back his cost structure, the lowest he can wind back, the further down he can get the labour component, the better chance he has of getting that contract. Therefore, you get the lowest common denominator in wages coming in to the individual and you get that through all sorts of industries in this country. It would lead to a very low paid work force without very much dignity at all. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the crunch of this debate and what the previous speaker was talking about, because those on the other side of the House really are about making sure there is not any disadvantage rule&mdash;that somebody can go down as low as the employer can drive them. The further down they can get you the better the opportunity. That will be the name of the game; that will be what enterprise bargaining is about.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At issue here are the nature of employee safeguards, the effect of the agreements on wages and conditions, and employees' own assessments of the impact of change and bargaining on their working lives. I see that the report deals with some of that and I see that the less consultation shown by employees, the worse off they feel&mdash;the more they feel they are being discriminated against or they have lost out on the bargaining process. The more consultation, the more involvement they have, the better off they certainly feel about gaining a benefit from the bargain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the federal scheme there are several legislative tests or requirements in addition to the consultation requirement designed for a more effective and fairer outcome. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission must be satisfied that there are tests that have been met in order for a new federal agreement to be certified or approved. The no disadvantage test requires the AIRC to be satisfied that an agreement does not, in relation to its terms and conditions of employment, disadvantage the employees whom it covers. This means that the AIRC will not approve an agreement which results in a reduction of employees' entitlements and protections taken as a whole, unless the AIRC considers that such reduction is not contrary to the public interest. In order to have access to agreements, employees' terms and conditions of employment must be covered by an award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual report for 1994 shows that there have been several significant gains with growth in enterprise and work place agreements, particularly in the federal industrial relations scheme and in the service sector, with bargaining spreading across a large range of industries to cover a majority of employees right throughout the federal scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report did identify some concerns and these are bound to occur in this system and in any scheme that is starting up. These include some lack of skills and resources for agreement making; improvement in workplace relations, women and other groups and bargaining; and the commitment of those involved&mdash;that is, people committed to proper bargaining rather than not bargaining from one side to another or bargaining one down because one is stronger than another, or one not having the skills or the information to bargain fairly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Labor government is trying to iron out some of these problems and to develop better relations between employers and employees, I do not see very much progress from the other side at all. The other side continues with the argument to get rid of the `no disadvantage' rule so that it can drive conditions and wages down. The other side of the House is about opening up the system so that a bargain can be driven for the lowest possible wages in this country. The other side will continue to do so and this is the policy it will take to the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This policy comes from the support of the other side of the House for individual contracts. The bottom line of the other side of the House in its bargaining position will be to have people sign individual contracts. As somebody walks onto a work site, they will be asked to `sign here'. Suddenly, the worker will find himself or herself working alongside somebody who is doing exactly the same work but who is being paid twice as much or a third as much again as the worker is being paid merely because he has been there a bit longer or there has been another agreement reached and his contract does not come up for renewal again. This is hardly a situation for industrial harmony or for getting people to work together to improve productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the long term, it is a recipe for suspicion, jealousy and disruption. The quality of work is sure to fall and the situation will act as a disincentive for people in the workplace to work as a team. There will be no enthusiastic feeling for work and no pride in being rewarded for helping to make the company successful in any way. Desperate people will sign on for the sake of getting a job; that is what other people play on and have always played on. But, if people cannot meet their basic commitments in life&mdash;housing, food and transport&mdash;they will become the working poor of Australia and they will be forced into having to survive with these minimal conditions and wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be thought that it is great for the bosses to control conditions, but, if the other side of the House has its way, we will going back to other eras of our history, with charities being forced to cope with more and more handouts and with people not being able to make ends meet. There needs to be a safety net and there needs to be a means by which people can ensure that they are not used and abused by the bad employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an adjournment speech recently, the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) talked about how small business will pick up all the unemployed people in Australia. The member for Grey quoted somebody&mdash;he said that it is an old statement&mdash;in saying that there are 700,000 small businesses and that, if they all employ one new person, Australia will do away with the unemployment issue. It is such a naive view to think that it is possible for all small businesses to take on another individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this report on enterprise bargaining shows, there is a great deal of enterprise bargaining coming into play. There have been agreements reached during which everybody concerned has shown goodwill and where pluses for both sides have occurred. Where there is goodwill and a system of not disadvantaging employees, through enterprise bargaining major gains can be made in productivity and profitability and, therefore, everybody involved with the enterprise is better off. But the enterprise has to be based on goodwill and the debate and the bargaining have to be fair and reasonable. However, to achieve this situation, you need some rules in place so that people are not disadvantaged. The no-disadvantage rule is of major importance to the working people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe the report shows the transparent and open approach that this government has to industrial relations. People can see where we are and what we are doing, as opposed to those on the other side, who are continuing not to announce their full policy or tell working people of Australia what they could expect under those on that side of the House if they were in government. I think that is a very dishonest position. That is certainly a position that I will be pointing out to most of the workers around my electorate in Tasmania&mdash;that the no-disadvantage rule will certainly disappear, that individual contracts will be the go under a government from the other side and that people will certainly be much worse off.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to make a couple of comments about previous speakers in this debate on enterprise bargaining. Firstly, there have been some comments about unions and how the Liberal Party is anti-union, how we want to bash the unions and how they are a very separate enterprise. In fact, the Australian Labor Party is the political arm of the union movement. We all know that and I think it is time that we actually started admitting that in this place. The union movement, we all know, started up a hundred years ago or thereabouts and established its own political arm called the ALP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To question that, one has to look at the way that they are funded. They are funded in a lot of ways by government grants. If we look at the amount of donations the unions pay back to the ALP, being the lay party, one then thinks there must be some sort of collusion here, or alleged collusion, between the union movement and the ALP, using taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But also we can look at the members of parliament on the ALP side who are former members of unions. The current president of the ACTU is about to join the parliament, if he is successful in the next election; we have Minister Crean, the member for Hotham, who is a former president of the ACTU; and the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, was a member of the ACTU as president. Although we have not put our IR policy into the workplace or into the political environment yet, already the president-elect, Ms Jennie George, is saying, `We are not going to be working with the Liberal movement.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some suggestion about union disputation reducing over the period of the ALP government. Of course it would be. Why would they want to have a dispute with their own party? That is the reason why there is no union disputation during this period of ALP government, because they in fact run the government themselves, so why look bad? It is also interesting to note that the member who just spoke, the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), talked about individual contracts. He is going to be putting this in writing, advising his electorate about it. I hope he does because he may be found to be wrong. Who knows what our policies are, but I hope he puts all that in writing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to join the discussion today on the 1994 annual report for the Department of Industrial Relations on private enterprise bargaining in Australia. It is my view that the whole issue of enterprise bargaining has been hijacked by the high farce of Australian politics and the breast-beating of the industrial relations club. It seems from anecdotal evidence, and even in this report, that many Australian workers are being left behind in the important process of determining their own conditions of employment. The biggest thing that concerns many of the people I speak to in my electorate about employment is not necessarily unemployment but job security. They are afraid of losing their jobs. Although in Western Australia we have the lowest unemployment in Australia and we have rapid growth over there, they are still afraid of losing their jobs under the current federal arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one reviews the report and looks behind the bureaucratic gobbledegook, which one encounters in many reports, one can see some potential problems with the course on which Australian industrial relations is heading. It seems that the beneficiaries of this course of New Age IR policies are in fact big business, big unions and those involved in the industry club of IR. Small businesses, employees of small businesses, non-English speaking migrants and, in many cases, women and part-time workers are not the beneficiaries. The warm and fuzzy feelings given to us by the many who support the current arrangements are simply hollow rhetoric based upon expediency of politics, for it seems that the word `human' has been taken out of the new IR regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No longer do we have `human' resources and `human' relationships, so important in the modern workplace. Rather, we now have a desire to seek greater return on the invested dollar. Gone is the need for enterprises to base their operations on providing a service to the market and to the many stakeholders&mdash;not shareholders, but stakeholders&mdash;associated with an enterprise, and thus to contribute to the development of a healthy community. What we now have is an industry basing itself on financial profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing wrong with the notion of basing yourself on profit, as long as it is in direct proportion to the vital development of the greater community; but, now, these enterprises are mostly seeing their employees as figures on a balance sheet. In human terms, enterprise bargaining has focused enterprises on value for money and it has ignored the greater importance of humanising an enterprise. There are exceptions to the rule on any issue, and some enterprises are empowering their staff; yet, so often, enterprises are fixated on dollars rather than on people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to reflect upon the changes that our world has been facing over the last 20 or so years. We are in the grip of a major crisis of change, a transitional period. We are going from the industrial age into the information or technology age. Two hundred years ago, we went through a similar period of transition. It was called the Industrial Revolution and it lasted for about 50 years and was a period of great crisis where we went from the agricultural age into the industrial age. There were people who saw the opportunity within crisis&mdash;since crisis can offer either danger or opportunity&mdash;and there were countries, companies and organisations that saw the opportunity to go into the industrial age at a rapid rate of knots and to develop in that way&mdash;America and England being two good examples. A good example of the countries that wanted to hang on to their old agricultural ways and wanted to hang on to their old agricultural structures would be the countries of eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving forward 200 years, we are now going through another period of transition which is really challenging everything in our society. We are challenged in our community, our education system, the way we do things, and everything that we do&mdash;just as happened 200 years ago in the Industrial Revolution. What we are challenged to do is to move from the industrial age into the information age or the technology age. We are finding, of course, that the structures of management are breaking down. People are trying to make the hierarchical pyramid structure that we had in the industrial age flatter and meaner. Of course, that is not working. What is working is a network structure where you have independent work modules who are empowered for their own decision making capabilities and who can operate independently with a common vision in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to this networking and empowering of industry, companies and enterprises is in fact a reduced and relaxed industrial relations systems. But what we see is a more structured approach. Even the report says, on page xxxiv, `Many of the changes that were observed, for better or worse, in Australian work places were changes that would have occurred anyway.' We have a system of enterprise bargaining still based upon the industrial age; and, although industry and enterprises are crying out for some change, we are not really seeing any change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing a continuation of industrial age thinking, driven by industrial age managers and supported by industrial age unions.We do not see New Age thinking which empowers employees to participate in decision making and work strategies. As an example of that, page xxxv of the summary in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enterprise bargaining in Australia</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence from employees on workplace cooperation suggests that, both for workplaces with Part VIB agreements and for non-VIB workplaces, there remained considerable scope for improvement of workplace relations. A large part of the responsibility for this is in the hands of management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A weak performance by management, in both Part VIB and non-VIB workplaces in improving information flows and employee participation in decision-making, in the context of growing calls on employees to increase effort or work under great stress, and increased pressure on their ability to balance work and family lives, is a major reason why there were not more employees expressing the view that they had been made better off as a result of workplace bargaining. It is largely up to management&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>industrial age management, by the sound of this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to find better ways of dealing with this collection of issues. Where it does not, it may find that employee willingness to continue the process of negotiation and change at the workplace-level may wane. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I tend to agree with that summary, because I do not think the actual enterprise bargaining system is working, for the reason that the people involved&mdash;whether they be big business, big unions, managers, unionists or whatever they might be&mdash;are still tied up in the notion of industrial age thinking and have not moved forward into the information age. We see that the very authors of the report are concerned about the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of the IR system not yet working effectively is the statement of the authors that it was `less likely to provide for different rates of pay rises for employees covered by agreements'. In other words, if you are the best worker in an enterprise, you will get paid exactly the same amount of money as the worst worker in an enterprise. I, as an individual who wants choice in an enterprise, suggest that is unfair. Any fair-thinking unionist would agree with me, I think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, they are stuck in the industrial age thinking, and they say, `Lowest common denominator: let's pay everyone the same and let's forget about paying or rewarding people who want to put in.' In other words, if an employee wants to assume the rights offered by an employer, and accepts the responsibility of putting effort into their work, why should the employee be discriminated against? Enterprise bargaining, in fact, is discriminating against those employees who want to put the effort in and increase the opportunity of potential income increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is but one of the examples of where the enterprise bargaining system is letting down employees who have confidence&mdash;great confidence&mdash;in their own abilities, and have to accept this notion of lowest common denominator pay. Why should someone who wants to put the effort in have to accept the lowest level? It says here, according to the authors, that it is less likely to provide different rates of pay for employees covered by agreements. Why can the better employees not get paid more?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the principles of enterprise bargaining. However, I believe that there is much to do within the whole area of workplace reform. One of the areas that needs reforming is the understanding that we are out of the industrial age and we are moving into empowering employees in the decision making process. We have to accept that. I have yet to see that&mdash;wanting to move away from the industrial age, into the information and technology age&mdash;from major enterprises, I have yet to see that from major management organisations, and I have yet to see that from major unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very good example of the reason the unions are suffering in this area is their membership downfall. They are not getting into the service industries which are servicing the information age. All the commentators say there should be some change in workplace reform. All the practitioners say there should be some change. Employees have stated, in this report, that they want to do more and they are capable of doing more. Yet the IR club is wallowing in a scheme which is old-world. It is still just wanting to project the scheme that it has developed over many years, which was structured well for the industrial age but is not appropriate for the information age or for individual networking modules with individual decision making capacity and strategies. It is not appropriate for any of that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the sake of a profitable future for our young people who are suffering under the policies of the government, because they are not getting employed in our industries, we need to urgently address these issues and look at enterprise bargaining. Perhaps the IR clubs should consider that there are things other than paying on the lowest common denominator and that we should be looking at rewarding those who want to put the effort in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to make some comments on the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enterprise bargaining in Australia</EMPHASIS>. It is an issue that I, as a former union official in the service sector, have some considerable interest in. I also have some interest in the structural changes that are going on in our economy which are, amongst other things, making things fairly difficult for unions in many sectors. They are also leading to changes in how wage fixing occurs, how bargaining over pay and conditions is conducted and associated issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go through some of the main findings of the report. Firstly, enterprise bargaining in the federal system is now pretty widespread and it has become entrenched throughout the majority of workplaces covered by federal awards. Secondly, the extent of this coverage is significantly greater than has been the case within the state award systems that have enterprise bargaining as an adjunct. Thirdly, enterprise bargaining in the federal system has produced better outcomes, both with respect to pay and remuneration for employees and with respect to productivity and efficiency improvements for employers, than equivalents in the state systems. Fourthly, enterprise bargaining is better accepted by workers and unionists in the federal system than it is in the equivalent state systems. Fifthly, there are significant areas of the service sector that are significantly less permeated by enterprise bargaining than the remainder of the work force or industry. This is partly because of the fact that most of these areas tend to be predominantly covered by state industrial relations systems rather than by the federal system, although that is not exclusively the case. Finally, enterprise flexibility agreements&mdash;enterprise bargains for non-unionists&mdash;have, to date, spread only in a fairly limited way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are probably the major themes that I extract from the report. There is certainly a lot of very interesting data in the report. I commend the report to the parliament as a worthwhile exercise in seeking to understand the early stages of a new and very different industrial relations system in this country. Perhaps some of the more interesting aspects of the report relate to the findings on the perceptions of workers affected by enterprise bargaining, and some of their attitudes on what enterprise bargaining has meant for them. Surprisingly enough, it is not all positive. Given my own experience with enterprise bargaining as a trade union official, predominantly with people for whom enterprise bargaining was fairly difficult, that does not come as a great surprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a variety of statistics in the report. For example, the report estimates that at the end of 1994 roughly 1.46 million workers, or 57 per cent of employees, covered by federal awards are covered by enterprise bargains. I think it is very much a tribute to the efforts of those involved in both designing and managing the new system, including the minister, that enterprise bargaining has managed to spread to that number of people that quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreements are more common, according to these statistics, in the larger, more heavily unionised parts of the economy and in the public sector, both of which should come as no surprise. Reverting to my comments earlier about the extent to which there are negative responses to enterprise bargaining from workers, approximately one-third of workers surveyed indicated that in their view, in the enterprise bargains that they were now subject to, they had not had a fair chance to have a say in the process of determining their own pay and conditions through the enterprise bargaining process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an issue that requires a fair bit more examination. It certainly is a disturbing conclusion, one that my own experience suggests is not a great surprise. It is important for us to understand where enterprise bargaining has come from and why it is that we are seeing a decentralisation of the industrial relations process in Australia now. There is a tendency amongst some in the union movement to regard this as some sort of New Right plot, yet another sell-out by a devious Labor government or other such epithets. This is a fairly superficial analysis. Really, enterprise bargaining has emerged as a product of structural economic change in our society and, in essence, three critical and interrelated factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of these is diversification in the production process. The main award that I used to deal with as a union official&mdash;originally the commercial clerks award and subsequently the clerical and administrative employees award&mdash;covered somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 workers in the state of Victoria, ranging from the smallest enterprise up to BHP head office. Back in the forties, when that award and others were probably in their heyday, the notion that you could have a single document setting out in effect a comprehensive set of terms and conditions, a comprehensive employment contract covering that number of people working across an incredibly diverse range of enterprises, had some merit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These days, with the types of activities being performed by office workers, the types of skills that they are being asked to employ and the demands being placed upon them by their employers, the needs of their employers are infinitely more diverse than they were back in the forties and fifties. It is becoming increasingly difficult to have that sort of broad, catch-all award covering such a diverse array of enterprises and such a vast number of people, because of the intrinsic diversification that is going on in the workplace within the production process. For customised work arrangements that are emerging, we are inevitably going to need more customised employment contract arrangements. That is the first of the three influences that have produced enterprise bargaining and will produce further change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second of these influences is internationalisation. What that has done is to put enormous pressure on Australian industry, particularly trade exposed industry, to get rid of entrenched, inefficient work practices, demarcations and a variety of other things. Essentially, they have been allowed to develop and remain because of the protected status of much of Australian industry for many years. With exposure to international competition and a much harsher international environment putting a lot of pressure on many Australian companies, the heat has understandably gone on many of these practices. However glibly people may look at these things and decide that they should be eliminated, it is not easy to do so when they actually get down to the practical grassroots problems, when they are facing a given situation in the workplace with a group of workers with established arrangements, established entitlements, a given level of morale and commitment to the firm. It is not easy to change these things. Having been part of it in a number of areas, I understand this only too well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third factor which has driven enterprise bargaining has been the growing gap in pay that the market is offering to people according to their skills so that those with greater skills and greater flexibility and adaptability are increasingly attracting a higher and higher premium for those skills. The old centralised system, including paid rates awards, has been cracking under the strain of that increasing market pressure for higher pay for higher skilled workers. That in itself is a problem for government and a problem for the solidarity of our society, and has to be tacked in other ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, however, serious problems with enterprise bargaining and I would like to comment on just some of them. The first and most obvious is that the impact of enterprise bargaining on industrially weaker workers, such as those I generally represented as a union official, can be quite adverse. This is an understandable consequence of a more market based system of wage determination. Particular groups in the work force, such as women workers who tend to occupy less industrially powerful positions, casual and part-time workers, people from a non-English speaking background, people with lower skills or very broad generic skills that are easily replaceable, lack bargaining power and lack muscle. If there is a system such as enterprise bargaining that is predominantly based on muscle, then inevitably those people are going to suffer relative to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Blue-collar workers, particularly the skilled male blue-collar workers in many parts of industry, have a fair bit to trade in the game of enterprise bargaining. They have the ability to do deals and to back up their negotiating power with muscle to ensure that they get reasonable deals. Also, unlike many service workers, unlike many workers in some of the New Age areas that the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) referred to, their productivity is amenable to measurement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great difficulties that my union had with enterprise bargaining was that, with the type of workers that we represented&mdash;office workers, often multiskilled, conducting a range of tasks according to what day it was and what was going on&mdash;it is very difficult to measure changes in their productivity. This is a problem which ultimately means that some people are going to benefit a lot more from enterprise bargaining than others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience that our union has had in many areas of enterprise bargaining has been that deals that we have ultimately been forced to accept have often included loss of very basic things such as tea breaks, people working unpaid hours, chronic understaffing being entrenched and a range of other things, whereas people with more muscle, on the shop floor, for example, have been able to do deals for similar increases in pay without the serious loss of conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give a simple example with respect to the Ford Motor Company and the enterprise bargain where my union and the former ADSTE union were ultimately bludgeoned into accepting an enterprise bargain for a six per cent pay increase, which other unions, the blue-collar unions, also got for fairly limited trade-offs. The trade-offs that were ultimately forced out of our members were a shift to monthly pay, working three hours a week extra for no additional pay, and a variety of other more minor trade-offs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our members voted three times against accepting this deal and opted to stay on their current wage rates if that was the deal but, ultimately, the company was so determined to force this change through, even though it was clearly detrimental to their work force, that by applying individual pressure, by engaging in union busting tactics, they were ultimately able to get enough of our members to agree individually so that eventually the resistance of the membership to this deal collapsed, and the outcome was fairly predictable. That is a fairly good illustration of the types of things that happen under enterprise bargaining. Those who have less industrial muscle, those who have less to trade off, are often going to end up with adverse outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember though that there is a significant difference between the position of the government and the labour movement position on these issues and that of the opposition. What the opposition is ultimately on about&mdash;and I think the honourable member for Cowan expressed it fairly well&mdash;is individual contracts. Although the government and the labour movement are moving towards a more decentralised system, ultimately because of the broader forces in the society and in the economy that I referred to before, there still is a collective basis of social equity underpinning the system through things like safety net increases, award protection and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservative parties would tear all this away. They are trimming, shifting and trying to pretend that they will not but there is no doubt that if they do get elected these things will not last very long. What they are about is redistribution from the industrially weak, from the economically weak, to the economically strong. Jobsback was a recipe to destroy the award system, to put in such farcical mechanisms as the employee advocate to try and undermine the role of independent trade unions and ultimately to move people in the work force onto individual contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between the opposition and the Labor Party is that we support collectivism. We support collective social justice and not survival of the fittest. As I indicated, the honourable member for Cowan just put forward a very good exposition of a New Age version of survival of the fittest. Why should the employee who works a bit better not get paid more than the employee who in the subjective&mdash;and often flawed&mdash;judgment of the employer is not quite as good a worker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is ultimately a recipe for social division. It is ultimately a recipe for inequality and it is in complete contrast to the sort of hypocritical cant that we heard yesterday from the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) and from various opposition members about the growing inequality in our society. On the one hand, they complain about that inequality but, on the other, they are seeking to put in place policies which will massively increase inequality and unfairness in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So enterprise bargaining does have some dangerous aspects to it which tend in that direction, but it is occurring for broad, structural economic reasons. The government has put in place protective safety net measures to ensure that those who are weakest economically and industrially are substantially protected in the new wage fixing system that we have. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The whole idea of the class warfare of the 1890s should be dead and buried in the Australia of 1995. What we should be seeking to do, as members of this place, is to encourage an industrial relations system which will deliver fairness, cooperation, productivity, flexibility and, indeed, an overall better result for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) could only be described as a hapless individual because he has come into the parliament on a number of occasions and brought in various industrial relations amendments and, time after time, he has been forced to return to the chamber because his amendments have been proved not to work. Enterprise bargaining is a very major reform in Australia. Unfortunately, the government has taken the coalition's terminology but has brought provisions into the law that have ensured that enterprise bargaining has simply not worked as it should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party, of course, is heavily dependent on the trade union movement and heavily dependent on the trade union scare campaign at election times. One really ought to look at the comments made just after the 1993 election by the aspirant president of the ACTU, Jennie George, when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the employers have got to understand is that we won the election in March and this bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is referring to the industrial relations bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is a payback for the commitments that were made by the government in the course of that election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>Really, what Jennie George was saying was that the government bribed the union movement, the government had to deliver, and the industrial relations bill which was introduced by the minister and which became law was a reward for the union movement. We all know that that reward has not worked and the minister has had to change the legislation over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report we are noting here this morning comprises almost 400 pages&mdash;399, in fact&mdash;and I must say that there really was no good news for the minister there. There was no real joy for him in the reaction which this report received throughout the Australian community. It is fairly clear that employers are not happy; it is very clear that many employees are not happy, including women. So while the minister has put the best gloss that he could on this report from his own perspective, he really has to accept that his approach to enterprise bargaining has not worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 21 August 1995 where a report points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What has been hailed as one of Australia's major industrial relations reforms&mdash;the push for enterprise bargaining&mdash;is causing widespread dissatisfaction throughout the workforce, with a significant proportion reporting deteriorating job satisfaction, greater stress and reduced job security.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Melbourne, who spoke previously, pointed out some of the problems that the work force sees in relation to the government's approach to enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a situation where only 22 per cent of Australians are covered by enterprise agreements. That indicates that the government has not progressed as far as it could have in improving the acceptance of this changed work system in the country. Twenty-two per cent of all workers is not a very high percentage. One could look at the higher proportion of public sector workers who are covered by employment agreements, but one must observe the totality of the situation. When we have a position where only 22 per cent are covered it is fairly clear that the government really has not gone as far along the road as, indeed, it should have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also continues along the road of its scare campaign. We find that members opposite and the trade union movement go out into the newspapers and the various media outlets trying to suggest that we in the coalition are seeking to strip away basic working conditions and that we are seeking to return industrial relations to the law of the jungle. They are imputing bad motives to us and yet it is clear, if one looks at the major address made by the shadow minister for industrial relations, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), only a short time ago, that what the government has been saying is simply incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to have honesty in politics, we ought to have accountability in politics and, indeed, we in the coalition will have honesty in policies. We will deliver our policies prior to the election and, what is more, when we are elected to office we will implement our policies, unlike the current government, which was prepared to say absolutely anything prior to the last election in order to crawl into office. Of course, once the current government was elected, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) laughed in the faces of the Australian people and said, in effect, `These are only promises to get us over the line. We're over the line and we're now tearing up these promises.' Remember the l-a-w tax cuts, and so on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very sad indictment of the government's approach to politics to find that major players on the government's side continue to misrepresent our position. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) says that we are seeking to hack away at these safety nets. The Minister for Industrial Relations says that we are seeking to take the machete to the award safety net and to cut it to pieces. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) says that Mr Reith is committed to abolishing the no-disadvantage test. The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) says that we are seeking to demolish the very struts underneath our system of awards and that the no-disadvantage test will be kicked away. The reality is that the coalition will retain a no-disadvantage test; the shadow minister for industrial relations made that point very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It probably will assist the chamber if I make it very clear what we intend to do as a coalition in the area of industrial relations after the next election. The thrust of coalition policy will be to ensure that Australian workers receive higher pay in more productive workplaces. The coalition will maintain the current award system overseen by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The coalition will support the jurisdiction of the AIRC to deliver safety net wage increases for the lowest paid workers. The coalition will establish minimum working conditions for agreements to ensure adequate protection, especially for the low paid workers. These conditions will include the relevant applicable classification award hourly rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will make it easier for employers and employees to enter into direct negotiations about wages and conditions at individual workplaces. Obviously, for the workplaces with no union members, the coalition will not allow union bosses to intervene where they are not invited. Of course, that is a matter which will not please Ms George one iota. The coalition will ensure a fair go all round on the vexed unfair dismissals question. The coalition will restore section 45D and section 45E of the Trade Practices Act. We will support the right of workers to either belong to a union or not belong to a union and we will abolish union preference. If workers do want to belong to a particular union, the coalition will support their right to belong to a union of their choice and, as a result, the coalition will permit the dis-amalgamation of unions where this is the desire of the unionists themselves. We will retain a fair and reasonable no-disadvantage test against a fair and reasonable set of minima. Of course, we find that government members opposite continue to go out into the media and continue to misrepresent our position. They stand condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from the report on enterprise bargaining that we are debating today that large sectors of the work force are not satisfied with what the government has achieved in the area of enterprise bargaining. It is clear that the minister is on the ropes with respect to enterprise bargaining. It is clear that the minister is no longer driving the agenda here: trade unions are, indeed, flexing their muscles and the minister is reacting to trade union pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that large numbers of workers feel that they have not been consulted by the government on its reforms. They certainly have not been consulted on the way the government has implemented some of the enterprise bargaining. I think the minister ought to go back to basics. He ought to go back to the drawing board. He ought to pick up more than the coalition's words `enterprise bargaining'. He ought to get to the substance of what we seek to achieve, which is, of course, to introduce a system of fairness, cooperation, productivity and flexibility. The minister has not been prepared to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has not made anyone happy with his efforts. Women are upset by the report which has been handed down. Women's groups have claimed that women have not adequately benefited from the changes in the enterprise bargaining area. There has also been the suggestion that the enterprise bargaining that has occurred has favoured men. The simple fact of the matter is that only 22 per cent of Australian wage and salary workers&mdash;the earners&mdash;are currently covered by enterprise agreements. Sadly, the small business sector&mdash;the small work forces and the small workplaces&mdash;has hardly been touched by the enterprise bargaining arrangements. The large public sector and private sector businesses have largely picked up the enterprise bargaining changes that the minister has brought in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, so many of the award conditions which ought to be discussed between employers and employees have automatically been sucked up into those enterprise agreements. We support a reasonable set of minima. However, the government's whole approach to enterprise flexibility is exposed by the government's intention to support an appeal against the Tweed Valley Fruit Processors Pty Ltd enterprise flexibility agreement. This company was given $26,000 from the government's handouts which are designed to encourage EFA agreements. What happened was the EFA was approved by an overwhelming majority of employees and the AIRC, but its flexible sick leave provisions are now being challenged on appeal by the ACTU and the government is using taxpayers' money to support that appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workers under this particular EFA have not given up their sick leave. In fact, they will be paid for eight days sick leave, the award provision, irrespective of whether they take it or not. Their right to take time off when they are sick is unaffected as is their protection against dismissal for absence because of illness. We have a situation where an EFA protects the workers. The EFA in effect says that, although people might on average take only half of their sick time, every worker will be paid for a full eight days sick pay whether or not the person is sick. If a person is sick, he or she is still able not to come to work. The government is appealing against this after it has contributed $26,000 of taxpayers' money to facilitate the negotiation of this very agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the ACTU, yet again, has been able to crack the whip and the government has reacted to ACTU pressure. The workers and the employer are prepared to agree to this very reasonable arrangement and yet we find the ACTU is not happy. The ACTU is not happy that workers at Tweed Valley Fruit Processors Pty Ltd are going to get paid eight days sick pay, whether they are sick or not. It is bad enough for the ACTU to appeal, but to find that the minister and the government are prepared to support the appeal using more taxpayers' money, I think, is absolutely outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That exposes, once and for all, the fact that the government's approach to enterprise flexibility is a complete and utter sham. The government gave $26,000 to encourage this agreement. Everyone talked about it; everyone agreed. We now find that, because the ACTU is not happy, the government is going to use taxpayers' money to, in effect, undermine, or seek to undermine, the agreement which $26,000 of taxpayers' money helped to promote. I think the government stands condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has failed in that only 22 per cent of employees are covered by enterprise flexibility agreements. The government has failed in that small business has not been covered adequately by these agreements. The government has failed in that real flexibility has not occurred. The government stands condemned because it has misrepresented the position of the coalition. It always undertakes scare campaigns, but the Australian people have seen through those scare campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Australian people are looking for honesty in politics. They are looking for accountability in government. The policy which will be announced by the coalition will be fair and reasonable. It will encourage enterprise flexibility agreements. The Australian people will support us at the next election. They will sweep those opposite from office as, indeed, they should be thrown out of government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on this motion to take note of the paper on the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enterprise bargaining in Australia</EMPHASIS>. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will appreciate, probably better than most, that some quite provocative remarks have been made by speakers from the opposition. I want to respond in a wider context before I get down to the element of enterprise bargaining in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rejoice in being the member for Chifley. My electorate is named after Ben Chifley, a man who had a distinguished record not only in the trade union movement but also in the Labor Party, and as Treasurer and Prime Minister of this country. I am proud to belong to the Australian Labor Party which is a part of the wider labour movement; that is, the movement with an industrial wing comprising unions, and a political wing comprising the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, too, have had a modest involvement in unions, for which I make no apology. I do not understand why opposition members seek to deride organisations that have as their aim and sole objective representing ordinary workers&mdash;the ordinary men and women of Australia, the ordinary young people of Australia. I find nothing inherently wrong in it. In fact, I think it is a real tragedy that only approximately 25 per cent of the work force in Australia is now represented by unions. Time after time in my electorate I have seen people being taken advantage of in the workplace because they have no union representation. One of the first principles that the opposition needs to understand is that people do not necessarily come to the workplace equally empowered. That is certainly true of a lot of employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a lot of changes in the 13 years of Labor government. We need to remind ourselves what the industrial scene was like prior to the election of a Labor government. There was, for example, a wages blow-out. That is, workers were getting wage increases, but inflation was very high and so they were not getting the real benefit of those increases and it was like a dog chasing its own tail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a lot of industrial disputes, one might even say confrontations, sometimes actually provoked by the previous government. It goes without saying that this government has enjoyed a record period of industrial harmony. But, more than that&mdash;and I think this is central to this proposition of enterprise bargaining&mdash;the previous industrial scene was characterised by highly structured unions, by demarcation disputes, and by a management system where confrontation was promoted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will demonstrate the change in the relationship between employees and employers in this period of Labor government. I was a member&mdash;as was the member opposite&mdash;of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training when it was doing an inquiry on skills. I was talking to one of the union delegates at a paper mill and he said, `Before the changes here'&mdash;and he was talking about productivity agreements and multiskilling&mdash;`what we used to do is clock on, and, when we clocked on, we left our brains behind.' I thought that was a very insightful description of the paucity of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke about the issue of multiskilling. We have seen in the metals trade some 300-odd different awards collapsed into nine&mdash;the idea that a worker not only can do one job but is trained to do a number of jobs. These were, and are, revolutionary changes compared with what there was before. What does enterprise bargaining cement? It cements the idea that both employers and employees are stakeholders in organisations, that they need to cooperate constructively and that they can do that within the framework of enterprise bargaining, such that both are not disadvantaged and such that both are advantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting in this report that workers covered by enterprise agreements, on average, are getting higher wage increases than those that are not. Here is another important point from a Labor perspective: we have never believed that the way forward is by reducing wages&mdash;in other words, that we can fuel further economic growth by slashing and hacking at ordinary workers' wages. I regret to say that there is so much in what I hear of the contributions of honourable members opposite and in their thinking that indicates that this still has a central place within the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enterprise bargaining is not about that. Enterprise bargaining is about two groups sitting down and discussing their conditions of employment, and changes to those conditions of employment, such that neither is disadvantaged and both are advantaged, and workers actually get increases. It is about harnessing the knowledge, enthusiasm and ideas of workers to make constructive input into the workplace. This was not the case. This was a rare exception in 1983 but now it is almost so commonplace that we take it for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) says, `Oh, it's terrible.' He says that the unions bribed the government and we are introducing legislation to satisfy the unions. We have made no secret of the fact that we belong to a labour movement. We make no secret of the fact that we consult with unions. But we consult with a lot of other people. Let me give you an example, Mr Deputy Speaker. At one stage I was responsible for defence industry policy and we were doing a review. It is true that I consulted with the unions; I consulted with the ACTU. Basically, I went out to the factory floors and consulted with the employers and some of the employees. A statistical analysis would show that we consulted more with the employees than we did with the unions or the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the Labor way&mdash;we like to listen: we do not like to reject ideas; we like to consult. And we have disagreements from time to time. You would never believe it, listening to the honourable member for Fisher. But of course we are interested in the welfare of ordinary people. That is what the Labor Party is all about. We are interested in how workers are faring. We want them to be the winners out of any system, not the losers. Maybe that is what distinguishes us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should mention another centrality in our approach to labour relations. We have been able to sit down with the ACTU and develop accords. Unlike the history of John Howard when he was Treasurer, we have not had a wages explosion. We have done very constructive things for the so-called social wage. We have done things that I am inordinately proud of that the Liberal Party or the conservatives wish to destroy in government. Let me give you an example. We have negotiated the situation so that ordinary workers, as opposed to private enterprise executives or public servants, should have the benefit of superannuation, and it is compulsory. We are going to make sure they do not dip out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do the opposition want to do? They want to do exactly what they did with the national welfare fund, which they destroyed. They are destroyers of workers' superannuation. A fully funded superannuation fund in the 1940s was destroyed by Menzies in the 1950s. Now we are saying in the 1990s that every worker ought to have a reasonable entitlement to his own superannuation. We think this is a measure long overdue but we do not think this measure lacks equity. We do not think it is unfair. But what do opposition members want to do about it? They say, `Look, this is wrong. This is coercion. What we should be doing is the old Liberal trick of putting rorts into the tax system, getting rid of the compulsion and then if people want to save for their superannuation they can.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That used to be the system under which everyone had the same opportunity to save but women hardly had it at all and ordinary workers did not have it at all. We have changed that. I just hope that the ordinary people of Australia understand that, while our system of industrial relations has meant that they have had to make many changes, for which I thank them, and many sacrifices, for which I thank them, these things are under jeopardy at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not assume for one moment that the Liberal Party will somehow abandon this fixation of wanting to see workers unrepresented. We had the member for Fisher saying, `Well, of course, we're going to dis-amalgamate unions, we are going to allow them to dis-amalgamate,' when all the management theory says about organisations that you need to have a customer focus, that is, union members; you need to provide services, that is, services for union members; and the greater your revenue stream, that is, the larger the union, the greater potential you have to provide these services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is somehow excommunicate anathema to opposition members. What they want to see is thousands of small unions. In fact, they would love to see an enterprise with 50 members have its own union. Well, I just do not understand it. I just do not understand why they want to attack ordinary people and their conditions of work this way. It doesn't make sense in management terms or organisational terms and it is a vicious attack on ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was saying that workers have made a lot of sacrifices. I believe they have. They have seen a whole revolution occur in the workplace. As I have said, they have seen the demarcations go which used to provide them a measure of security, if you like, a measure of employment&mdash;not something that I would justify. They have seen multiskilling come in. They have had to go back and get extra skills&mdash;be trained and re-trained. They have seen downsizing. They have seen massive productivity increases. This is again a difference between a Labor government and a Liberal government: we believe that through work organisation, through new ways and better ways of doing it, through capital equipment, you can dramatically increase productivity, as we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other way we can increase productivity is to make labour cheaper. That is the conservative way. We reject that. We have seen lots of organisations downsize. Before I came to this place, I worked for Telecom. There have been massive changes and downsizing there and changes at a rate and pace that have almost been dysfunctional. That is not unique. It has been occurring right throughout Australia. People have adapted and coped and I congratulate them for that. I congratulate them for their positive approach. They have responded well to these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this report suggests, enterprise bargaining is here to stay under a Labor government. Its reach will be increased dramatically. Ordinary men and women of Australia are not going to be disadvantaged in the process and we will not attack worker organisations. The enterprise bargaining report is a good report. As many people as possible should get hold of a copy of the report and they will find that the government has done well. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Statistics on the citizenship of people who apply for permanent entry into Australia are not kept but statistics are available on the number of applicants by place of birth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) It is presumed that the question relates to the lack of access to a full range of consular services by members of the FYROM community in Australia. The Government is indeed aware of, and sympathetic to, the inconvenience that lack of access to consular services is causing Australians of FYROM origin in areas such as issue of passports and personal legal matters. That lack of access was one of the reasons for Australia's recognition of FYROM in February 1994 for it laid the ground for the establishment of formal relations between the two countries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The major classification system for research is the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Field of Research Classification (FORC). The FORC is a broad, discipline-based classification system. Research on renewable energy cannot be identified from FORC and would be subsumed in several disciplines including General Engineering, Biological Sciences and the Social Sciences. Renewable energy is, however, specifically categorised within the ABS set of Socio-economic Objectives (SEO). SEO was first collected for all Large Research Grants lodged in March 1994 and for those Large Research Grants which commenced in January 1995. For Collaborative Research Grants which were lodged in May 1995, the successful ones will commence in January 1996. Hence, information provided is limited to such grants.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Department does not ask people when they are receiving or applying for payments if they are members of commercial or community based bartering systems. This is not necessary as `barter points' or `trade dollars' earned through approved exchange trading schemes are exempt from the income test. To be exempt, a scheme must not be run for profit and must be primarily aimed to help participants maintain their labour market skills. However, cash earned or assets accrued through such schemes is subject to the income and assets test, respectively, and must be notified to the Department.</PARA>
