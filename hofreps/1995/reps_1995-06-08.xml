<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report stemmed from an audit report into the sale and contained four recommendations. These recommendations were aimed at ensuring that appropriate mechanisms are in place to monitor the performance of obligations arising from the Aussat sale in the years leading up to the termination of the telecommunications duopoly in 1997 and to draw lessons from the sale process to develop more effective procedures and controls for the benefit of future sales of government assets and business enterprises. I believe the committee's recommendations have made a valuable contribution in these areas and it is pleasing to note the generally positive responses contained in the Finance minute. I commend the minute to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to enable the telecommunication standardisation component of Australia's contribution to the International Telecommunication Union to be recovered through carrier licence fees payable by telecommunications carriers from 1 July 1995. The ITU is a United Nations specialised agency which is concerned with international cooperation in the use of telecommunications and the radio frequency spectrum. It establishes agreements and recommended world standards for telecommunications and radiocommunications services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, telecommunications licence fees only recover the public interest regulatory costs incurred by the Australian Telecommunications Authority, and the total fees payable by the carriers must not exceed the appropriation provided to Austel for the previous financial year. Carrier licence fees are payable on 1 July 1995. Inclusion of the ITU contribution in carrier licence fees is in addition to Austel's appropriations and will exceed the amount able to be collected under the current legislation. An amendment to the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Act 1991 is therefore necessary to enable the full recovery of the telecommunication standardisation component of the ITU contribution from carriers from 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's ITU contribution for a given calendar year is paid prior to the commencement of that year. The amount of the ITU contribution is likely to change every year. The amount to be recovered from carriers for telecommunications sector activity will depend upon the level of the total ITU contribution, which is set in Swiss francs and is subject to exchange rate variation, and the share ascribed to the telecommunication standardisation sector of ITU activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for an amount to be determined under the regulations as the proportion of the Commonwealth's contribution to the total budget of the ITU for a calendar year that is attributable to matters relating to telecommunication standardisation. It is proposed to amend the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Regulations to prescribe a procedure for determining the additional fee before 1 July 1995 in order for the ITU contribution to be included in the carrier licence fees due on that date and on 1 July of each succeeding year in respect of a general telecommunications licence or a public mobile licence. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Impact</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of the proposed amendments on carriers will be to increase the annual amount payable in licence fees by a total of approximately $1 million. The cost will be shared by carriers on the basis of their share of telecommunications traffic. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Act 1991, the total of the annual telecommunications licence fees must not exceed the cost of running the industry regulator, Austel, in the previous fiscal year. The Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Amendment Bill 1995 seeks to change the upper fees limit, allowing the government to also recover the costs of Australia's contribution to the International Telecommunication Union, the international telecommunications regulatory body.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994-95 the cost of running Austel was $12.6 million, all of which was funded by the carriers&mdash;namely Telstra, Optus and Vodaphone. The ceiling allows the government to internalise the costs of telecommunications industry regulation by making the carriers pay for the regulator, while preventing the use of carrier licences for the purposes of general revenue generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Telecommunication Union is a United Nations body charged with prescribing telecommunications standards, radio communications planning and other related activities. Whilst Australian carriers currently make their own separate ITU contributions, the Australian government contribution to these payments to the ITU in 1993-94 totalled $4.86 million. Prior to 1991, Telecom, OTC and Aussat paid for the government's ITU contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's contribution to the operation of the ITU is quite high relative to the size of our economy and the contributions of similar developed nations. The proposed amendment raises the ceiling on carrier fees so as to include the telecommunications standards component of Australia's ITU contribution, allowing the government to recover this outlay from the telecommunications carriers. Regulations will determine the size of this component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There appears to have been no official notification to the carriers that this bill was being prepared. The carriers, I understand, accept the general principle that domestic, industry specific regulation should be funded by the industry, but they are less than enthusiastic about covering payments to international bodies. The carriers have no official position on this matter due to the lack of warning of the bill being introduced. According to the explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill, the government intends to recover about $1 million of its contribution from the carriers in the coming financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There appears to be no provision for fee reductions in recognition of corporate contributions by the carriers directly to the ITU. Telstra will bear the cost of this measure, as it is by far the largest carrier. However, it is likely that it will offset this increased levy with a commensurate cut in its own ITU contribution. The net effect is likely to be a reduction of Australia's total contribution to the ITU. The bill is expected to reduce the burden on the taxpayer, as it transfers responsibility for government payments to the ITU to industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not oppose this bill, but I take this opportunity to once again deplore the government's lamentable record in this portfolio. As we have seen in the past, the government is determined to blindly charge ahead with its own agendas, with a total lack of consultation with those people who will be directly affected by the changes&mdash;the telecommunications industry. This lack of consultation is quite startling, given the lack of any urgency behind this bill. The responsibility for making these payments will fall on industry and, while the amounts will not seem excessive, the carriers should have at least been notified that the changes proposed by this bill were to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this in mind, the coalition will carefully scrutinise any regulations which come before the House under this bill. The proposed regulations will determine the size of the telecommunications standards component of Australia's ITU contribution, an amount which is payable by government and recoverable by government from the carriers. It is to be hoped that some consultation, or at least some warning of the nature and scope of the regulations, will be given to the carriers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are here today to consider the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Amendment Bill 1995. In 1991 the government introduced a package of legislation aimed at reforming the telecommunications industry. One of the provisions of the Telecommunications Act 1991 was to allow for network competition by giving the Minister for Communications and the Arts power to license Australian trading corporations as general telecommunications carriers. General carriers are the primary providers of Australia's telecommunications services. The act also provides for a licensing regime for public mobile carriers who supply public mobile telecommunications services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Act 1991 provides that the holders of general telecommunications licences or public mobile licences must pay a fee to the Commonwealth for the licence. Section 6 of the act sets out the limit on total annual fees that become payable under the act. The amount of the fees or the formula by which fees are determined is set out in regulations. According to the second reading speech for the 1991 legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the amount or the formula determined by the regulations should represent a reasonable estimate of the administrative costs borne by Austel in directly regulating the activities of the carriers . . . There is an upper limit on the total of the fees that may become payable under this legislation in any one financial year. This limit is the amount of Austel's appropriation from the consolidated revenue fund for the previous financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment proposed in this bill would add to this limit an amount which is a proportion of the Commonwealth's contribution to the total budget of the International Telecommunication Union&mdash;the ITU. The upper limit will thus be fixed by a combination of Austel's appropriation plus a proportion of the Commonwealth's contribution to the ITU. The amount of the Commonwealth's contribution to the ITU, which will be taken into account for the purpose of determining the limit on the total of annual fees, will be determined by regulation. The amendment applies to fees payable for general telecommunications licences and public mobile licences from 1 July 1995 or from 1 July in each succeeding year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said by the shadow minister for employment, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), there is broad support for this legislation across both sides of the House. But it is also an opportunity to reflect on what has been happening in recent years in the telecommunications sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has launched into a major reform in the telecommunications industry as an industry where there is significant potential export benefit, where there is scope for significant job growth and where there is an industry which&mdash;when we talk about the need for a smarter country&mdash;fits into that with respect to the increasing levels of technology and development that are occurring on an ongoing basis. As such, it is an industry that is crucial to the development of Australia's future. We can be proud of what the government has achieved over the years in this area&mdash;an area of massive change on a continuing and evolving basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to what the government has done, there is a range of facts I would like to put on the table. What we have seen is improved efficiency and customer service. That has been as a result of the telecommunications service sector making the changes that have had to be made in the circumstances. That is a great credit to the companies and their workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at today's prices, they are, on average, some 40 per cent lower for the long distance and international markets than they were five years ago. The reform that has occurred in the Australian telecommunications industry has become a model which is being viewed by many countries as a potential way forward for them in terms of adjusting their own status where they have monopoly providers and are looking towards a more competitive, effective and efficient regime. We have countries visiting here on a regular basis, examining what we are doing, using it as a basis for what they are looking at, with respect to change within their own society. Mobile phone use in Australia is up&mdash;it is up from around 650,000 users in 1992-93 to over one million users today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the industry itself, I was recently at a meeting with representatives of the Australian Telecommunications Industry Association. They had a particularly good story to tell with respect to this industry in Australia. It is a growing success story. Seventy per cent of their requirements are provided locally within Australia. Employment wise, they provide around 13,000 jobs directly&mdash;and that is not counting the question of indirect job creation as a result of their activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to investment and advanced manufacturing, we are talking about $100 million per annum. Their local sales within the Australian market, therefore avoiding the need for imports, is around $4 billion per annum. Their export performance is growing and is now valued at around $800 million per annum. They are at the forefront of research and development, with expenditure of around $180 million per annum. They have estimated that value adding per employee has increased 40 per cent over the last five years. It is becoming a more efficient, effective and productive industry and therefore, I think, embraces a range of issues that those on both sides of the House seek to pursue with respect to reform in the economy and in terms of building a more successful and smarter economy. I think they are getting the runs on the board on a continuing basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a range of examples in relation to export activities which I think highlight the depth of market penetration overseas in a range of different activities and in a range of different geographical areas, for example: switching cable and optical fibre contracts in China; submarine cable exports worth $250 million; data communications contracts in China, Europe, Thailand and Malaysia; cable contracts in Vietnam; rural telecommunications components in Indonesia, Thailand and Papua New Guinea; and cellular equipment in South America. Twelve of our telecommunications suppliers are in the top 400 exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of that, I think, points to the fact that we have a vibrant, developing and growing telecommunications industry. That industry is evolving and growing over time and, because it is a continually changing and evolving industry, the regulatory framework it works under has to adjust accordingly. This bill is a necessary although small, I suppose, part of the necessary changes that have to be made to that overall regulatory framework, and it has bipartisan support. This bill is necessary to ensure that that evolution occurs in a way which will assist the growth and development of the industry. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Amendment Bill, a piece of legislation directly involved with supporting the regulatory authorities of our telecommunications industry and telecommunications network. No-one would disagree with the speaker who has just resumed his seat, the member for Corinella (Mr Griffin), in his support of the expansion of the industry in Australia, the improvements in its efficiency and its particularly valuable involvement in export industries through the development of higher technology in research in this country. However, I refer particularly to one part of the telecommunications industry; that is, the mobile phone section. This is directly involved&mdash;perhaps as far as the public is concerned it is more directly involved than any other&mdash;with regulation through Austel and the application of the telecommunications code.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this area that I believe the government is deficient in that it has failed to provide through the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) a land access code. The minister is required to provide this under the Telecommunications Act. As the act directed last year that the minister should do this, I find it strange that he has not done so and that apparently there is no urgency in providing the code he has been directed to so provide under the legislation passed by his own government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This only highlights the fact that when we have further expansion, as we do have, of the mobile phone system and we enjoy&mdash;all of us here do, I expect, and so do many more in the community&mdash;the system on a monthly basis, we must know that some people pay a price for the expansion of that system. That price is the diminishing environmental enjoyment of some of the residents of our community who have to put up with the visual impact of increasing numbers of telecommunications towers and antennae. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised this question in the debate on the budget because I am still involved, as a representative of my constituents, with very unsatisfactory procedures in relation to the installation of antennae and broadcasting equipment to support the mobile phone system. I know that other members, too, have been involved in what they consider to be a very unsatisfactory situation. The basis of why it is so unsatisfactory is that the three existing telecommunications companies involved in the expansion of the mobile phone system are operating under an exempt status in this community. Local, state and most Commonwealth government authorities have no particular authority as to where and how these communications facilities are installed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, again only as an example, without reiterating my previous remarks in this House, indicate that, whilst the telecommunications code sets out a broad range of activities that the companies must involve themselves in in so installing their equipment, there is an almost total lack of effective involvement locally in any disciplinary measures involved in those companies' activities. In the end, it is only the secretary to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and Austel who can have any particular influence on those installations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know those companies are becoming more careful of their public relations in this matter, but I give this instance yet again of a defective system as it applied to a particular installation. The installation involved had been shifted around in the council area because of local opposition to the particular sites that had been chosen. Eventually a site was chosen on the roof of a theatre. The council was informed by the company of its plans and plans of a certain dimension were given to the council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scale on the plans was wrong and when applied to the plan itself produced the wrong measurements of the installation. The plan itself was correct but the scale applied to it, which people used to understand what the size would be, was wrong. The plan supplied to the owner of the building, who agreed to the installation and of course would receive some rental, was wrong. The actual installation is something like 35 per cent bigger than the plans supplied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The council was notified by the company, which the company was obliged to do, and notified only one local resident. The telecommunications code, whilst it has all sorts of instructions to the company to notify the council, has no imperative that the council should notify its own residents. I have been told by a particular council officer in one other council that whilst the council has been notifying residents there is no obligation to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic problem that concerns the public is that companies, which have proliferated from one to three, are operating under exempt status. As the telecommunications industry is further deregulated, we can expect in 1997 a number of further entries to the mobile telephone network. We can also expect to find possibly a half a dozen or more companies under the current attitude operating under an exempt status that can in law snub their noses, if they so want to do, at the residents whose amenity they will impinge upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when the whole of the community is looking to visually improve its cities&mdash;and we, in South Australia, have a particular local government attitude to get rid of unsightly power poles&mdash;we have companies who are exempt from state and local council laws and planning. It is not possible for this situation to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that a review of the situation is to be made by Austel. I hope most seriously in the reviews that will be carried out that the citizens of Australia will have their authority restored through their elected representatives to council and state governments and to other federal government bodies in relation to their environment and that compensation, which is allowed and provided for for the acquisition of land and physical aspects, will be extended to the destruction of value of properties by the loss of amenity visually, which happens from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until this is done, there will be continuing injustice to an increasing number of people as more and more antennae are developed. I looked at some statistics provided by my colleague the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), who sends out from time to time some very interesting statistics to his colleagues; I do not know whether he sends them to members of the government. He included in the one that came yesterday a reference to the use of mobile phones in Australia. In 1990-91 there were 158 million calls. In 1992-93 there were 411 million calls. Those figures are outdated&mdash;I guess they are the last ones available&mdash;but they give some indication of the explosion in the use of mobiles phones in Australia and the new installations of towers to support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This hiatus, in the sense that old rules allow companies to operate under exempt status, will be untenable as companies reach out to make their multimillion dollar profits. That is not an anti-profit statement, but a simple statement of fact that you cannot have private companies proliferating which are able to install their installations with an exempt status in search of private profit. The power of local citizens must be restored in amendments to the telecommunications code. </PARA>

<PARA>The bills will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects to give effect to certain announcements in the 1995-96 budget. In regard to the company tax rate change, the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1995 will increase the general rate of company tax from 33 per cent to 36 per cent for taxable income of the 1995-96 and subsequent income years. The increased rate will apply to most companies, including non-resident companies, that are taxable in Australia. The new rate will also apply to public trading trusts, corporate unit trusts and limited partnerships that are taxed as companies. The non-statutory fund income of non-mutual life assurance companies will also be subject to tax at the increased rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change in the rate of tax will not apply to certain classes of companies or incomes that are taxed at special rates of tax. The new tax rate will not apply to the statutory fund income or the superannuation business of life assurance companies or to pooled development fund income. It will also not apply to the trustees of superannuation funds, approved deposit funds or pooled superannuation trusts or to registered organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concessional tax rates that apply to recognised credit unions for the income years up to and including 1996-97 are also not affected by the rate change. The change in the company tax rate will affect the operation of the franking accounts of companies. Changes to deal with the franking accounts matters will be provided for in an amendment bill to be introduced later this year. The change in the company tax rate will provide revenue gains in the order of $320 million in 1995-96, $1,570 million in 1996-97, $940 million in 1997-98 and $1,140 million in 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Taxation of friendly societies and other registered organisations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1995-96 budget the government announced a review of the taxing arrangements that apply to the life insurance business of friendly societies and life assurance companies. The government is concerned that the review not interfere with the conduct of life insurance business. Accordingly the trustee rates that applied during the 1994-95 income year to the eligible insurance business of life assurance companies, 39 per cent, and friendly societies and other registered organisations, 33 per cent, will be maintained until the 1997-98 year of income while the review is undertaken. The tax rates that apply to the life insurance business of life assurance companies and friendly societies will be aligned as an outcome of the review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, amendments in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill will freeze the rate of tax imposed on the eligible insurance business of friendly societies and other registered organisations at 33 per cent for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 years of income. The rebate applying to taxable bonuses paid on life insurance policies issued by friendly societies will increase to 33 per cent from 1 July 1995 as scheduled and will be maintained at that level for the year beginning 1 July 1996. The cost to the revenue of the measures is expected to be $11 million in 1995-96, $45 million in 1996-97 and $22 million in 1997-98. There is expected to be a revenue gain of $4 million in 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tax advantaged computer programs</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales tax law contains a concession for goods containing computer programs on reprogrammable microchips. The concession was introduced in September 1992 through a Senate amendment. In effect, the exemption removed from the taxable value of goods the value of any computer program embodied in a reprogrammable microchip. This meant that a tax benefit could be obtained merely by putting computer programs on reprogrammable microchips instead of non-reprogrammable chips. The government strongly opposed the introduction of this measure, reflecting the range of drawbacks with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exemption has allowed some taxpayers to claim large reductions in their sales tax liability, and over all it is estimated to be costing the budget some $150 million per annum. Greater losses are anticipated as manufacturers switch to tax advantaged computer programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the fiscal costs, the exemption has caused a range of other problems, including the misallocation of resources by manufacturers using the more expensive reprogrammable microchips solely to get a tax exemption. There have been major problems for taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office in assessing the value of tax advantaged computer programs. These have resulted in some manufacturers gaining unfair competitive advantages and, given the difficulties with valuing foreign sourced computer programs, it is likely that some Australian manufacturers have been disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 is being amended to remove the concession in respect of computer programs contained on non-permanent microchips.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the two bills being dealt with here is the Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995. This, together with the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1995, amends income tax rates to increase the rate of company tax from 33 to 36 per cent. The bill is estimated to reap an additional $320 million in revenue in 1995-96; $1,570 million in 1996-97; $940 million in 1997-98; and $1,140 million in 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill implements a decision which is a complete violation of the assurances that the Prime Minister gave to the Australian people before the 1993 election. For this reason, the coalition will oppose and vote against this bill. The coalition will not be a party to, nor will it endorse, electoral fraud. If this House existed for the purpose of representing people and holding governments accountable, it would be rejecting this legislation. If this House&mdash;both sides of the House&mdash;took seriously its responsibility of holding governments accountable to the people of Australia, this would be rejected out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 February 1993 the Prime Minister announced in his Investing in the Nation statement that the Labor government would reduce company tax from 39 to 33 per cent if re-elected. On page 45, his Investing in the Nation statement said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To stimulate business investment, the Government will lower the rate of company income tax from 39 cents to 33 cents for taxable income . . .</PARA>
<PARA>On page 59, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduction in the statutory corporate tax rate to 33 per cent will provide Australian industry with a world competitive tax system.</PARA>
<PARA>During his Investing in the Nation address at the National Press Club and in the following questioning from journalists the Prime Minister put the hard sell on the cut in the company tax rate. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have decided that the simplest and most effective way to encourage Australian companies to work for Australia is to lower their tax burden. So, under a Labor Government, on 1 July this year the company tax rate will be reduced from 39 cents in the dollar to 33 cents . . . this will make the Australian corporate tax system highly competitive within the OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, I think perhaps more importantly, we will also be competitive with the countries in our region. Australian companies will thus be much better placed to trade with Asia&mdash;the region where it is going to matter most.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The imperative is to be competitive now with Asia in the region, and the competitive rates are down around those low 30s. So that's why if we want our dynamic companies . . . to go out there and get it, to go out there and take their share of the world market for Australia, you've got to give them a chance. And the chance is at rates comparable with all of the other tax rates in the Asia-Pacific region, and indeed the OECD. And that's why we've taken it down to 33 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet here we are in 1995 with a proposal from this government to reverse all of those highfalutin statements, all of those promises that were made before the election to try to garner in votes, and to dash the hopes of Australian corporates who might have been tempted to believe the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does he live with his conscience when he does this kind of thing on a regular basis? What possible explanation could there be for the complete violation of all of those high-minded sentiments made before the election which were not even carried through for one term of the parliament afterwards? I say to the Australian corporates and to the Australian people: you have seen him do it before; do not trust this character again. He has got form; he is a recidivist, a repeat offender; he is somebody who has tried this trick over and over again. No doubt before the next election the great repeat offender will stand up and say, `Trust me one last time.' With people like that, you consider their history, you take into account their behaviour and you judge accordingly. There is no basis whatsoever for any Australian corporate or any Australian taxpayer to trust this Prime Minister on a tax promise ever again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, even with the much vaunted reduction of the company tax rate from 39c to 33c&mdash;and remember it is now to be reversed to 36c&mdash;there was still a catch. With the announcement to cut the rate of company tax, the government decided to reintroduce quarterly payments of company tax to bring forward receipts to the government. For both 1995-96 and 1996-97 the government expected to match the revenue lost through cutting the rate of company tax by bringing forward company tax receipts. The government's announced increase in company tax in the budget is expected to increase revenue by $320 million in 1995-96 and by $1,570 million in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For both 1995-96 and 1996-97 the government has pulled off one of the most remarkable sleights of hand you have ever seen. By reducing company tax from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, by bringing forward company tax receipts and then by raising the company tax from 33 per cent to 36 per cent, the government will collect more revenue than it would have if it had not lowered the rate in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the figures contained in the 1993-94 budget, the government expected to fully offset the reduction in company tax from 39c to 33c in 1995-96 by bringing forward payments. In 1995-96 the tax cut would amount to $1,620 million and the new payment arrangements would bring forward an additional $1,620 million. It is a similar story for 1996-97. The tax cut would be $1,700 million, but the bringing forward of tax payments would bring in an additional $1,690 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of reducing the rate to 33c but offsetting it completely by bringing forward the tax payments, when you now take it back up again you gain extra revenue. This was the tax cut that increased the taxes payable to the government. It was a tax cut that brought in more revenue. This must be one of the greatest tax cuts of all time for this government. As a result of this budget, the rise in the company tax rate will bring in in net terms an additional $320 million in 1995-96 and an additional $1,570 million in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government has achieved a truly remarkable result by cutting the corporate tax rate from 39 per cent down to 33 per cent and raising it back to 36 per cent. It will actually raise revenue. The simple fact is that companies would be paying less tax in 1995-96 and in 1996-97 if the corporate tax rate had remained at 39 per cent with the same payment arrangements in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his deficit dalek speech last year at the MTIA national annual dinner, the Prime Minister posed the rhetorical question, when discussing where the government might take action to reduce the budget deficit, `Are we to increase the rate of company tax when we have at last a rate that is competitive with our Asian neighbours?' On budget night, he answered his own question&mdash;yes, we are to increase the rate of company tax when we at last have a rate that is competitive with our Asian neighbours. As a result of transitional arrangements in relation to payments, we have actually increased the tax burden on Australian companies in 1995-96 and 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Prime Minister is the real before and after man. There are actually intervening events that can allow you to assess after conduct against before conduct. Before conduct in the light of after practice is shameful conduct. The only thing that actually intervenes is an election. Once he has garnered in the votes, he starts garnering in the taxes. Have you noticed that? Once the votes come in, the taxes come in as well. But for business and corporates the taxes go out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But you will recall that the whole expression of this promise&mdash;the before promise&mdash;was that we had to have a rate of corporate tax which would allow Australian companies a go in the Asian region; that we would get a rate which was competitive with our Asian neighbours. I am not aware&mdash;and now, of course, we are putting it up&mdash;that any of our Asian neighbours have been increasing their corporate tax rates lately. I am not aware that this is being driven by an increase in the region so that we can match it without taking a competitive disadvantage. The simple fact is that our Asian neighbours are not increasing their corporate tax rates. Some of the applicable rates in the region are: 34c in Malaysia, 27c in Singapore and 30c in Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it has nothing to do with the Asian region. In fact, if we measured the after conduct by the before promises, all we would have to say is that the Prime Minister is actually trying to make our rates uncompetitive with Asia. That is the net effect; that is the logical conclusion. If the whole thing was premised by this view of competitiveness with Asia, the only explanation as to the current arrangements is uncompetitiveness with Asia. That must be the logical conclusion. The government must face that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Assistant Treasurer came in, was there any explanation as to why it was no longer necessary to have competitive rates with Asia? Was there any explanation as to why it was no longer necessary to have the rate that the Prime Minister had promised before the election? None whatsoever. We got the feeling that the Assistant Treasurer was going to get this bill in here and get out of this place as quickly as he could. Of course he could not explain it, and he has now run out of the chamber. Who would want to be around while the logic of the utter fecklessness of this Prime Minister with Australian corporates is being discussed here in the people's chamber?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to obtain an understanding of the government's true motivation behind the decision to increase company tax, it is also necessary to carefully scrutinise and sift through the words of the Treasurer (Mr Willis). In his budget night speech the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now that the economy is growing strongly it is appropriate that the corporate sector make a contribution to tightening of fiscal policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the rate of company income tax will be increased from 33 to 36 per cent for the 1995-96 and subsequent income years.</PARA>
<PARA>If we compare that language about contributions to tightening of fiscal policy with what the Treasurer was saying in the lead-up to the budget, the sheer magnitude of the Treasurer's hypocrisy, whose utterances are increasingly intellectually bankrupt, is revealed. On 30 November last year, in answer to a question on business tax concessions, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I don't want to comment on individual elements except to say this, that in that area of change to business tax there was certainly a considerable concern to get the economy moving again, so it was done with an eye to cyclical improvement. But it was also done with an eye to structural change, and that is to provide some longer term encouragement to investment. So I don't think it would be a case of simply saying, `Now the economy is growing well, we can rip all that away.' We clearly have to bear in mind the sorts of factors that we did take into account in making those changes, which were particularly the need to have a competitive tax regime for business.</PARA>
<PARA>So in November last year he was saying that this was done with an eye to the long term for a competitive tax rate. He was saying that it was done with an eye to structural change. Yet, in his own words, in his own budget, six months later when he said it was not the kind of thing you could rip all away, what did he do? He ripped it all away. It was a structural change which lasted all of six months. I would hate to see a temporary change from this Treasurer, wouldn't you? It was a structural change which lasted all of six months. He said that it was not done with an eye to being cyclical, he was not going to rip it away if things got better; yet he has stood up here and said, `You know that tax rate reduction, it's all off.' He is utterly intellectually bankrupt. It is the same with the Commonwealth Bank. The words and the intentions of the Treasurer in the prospectus amount to nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rise in company tax is just a grab for cash. The government has shown that it is incapable of controlling the growth in its own purpose outlays so it is resorting to new tax hikes. On the revenue side of the budget, the government will collect an additional $14 billion, a 12 per cent increase on the last financial year. Included in this rise the Treasurer and the Prime Minister will raise taxes by another $2 billion in 1995-96 alone. An extra $17 billion will be raised in revenue over the next four years as a result of changes announced in the budget, and $15.2 billion of that represents the imposition of new and increased taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you carefully analyse the budget, you can see that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are blind on one side. The only side they see is the revenue side. But I have to give credit where credit is due. The government undertook an extensive bid to soften up the community for this feckless repudiation of its election promise. The government sank to new depths in relation to spreading disinformation when people from the Treasurer's office were running around the press gallery saying that it was business that wanted a rise in the corporate tax rate. This reached new heights of ludicrous proportions when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 24 April carried a front page headline of `Business faces $1 billion tax rise'. The report said that the government had won big business support for a two per cent increase in the company tax rate as long as dividend imputation remained intact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember being asked about this by journalists, and I said to them, `If business wants a company tax rise, get one of them on the news tonight saying that it wants its company tax to be put up.' Later in the day, the Business Council of Australia completely denied the story. It revealed the story for what it was: a government inspired story having nothing to do with business or business intentions. It was what we have seen so often in relation to the budgets brought down by the master deceiver, the Prime Minister: the softening up of the public, the planting of press stories and the massaging of public opinion to try to provide a cover for the real intentions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's real intentions were to increase the revenue, having the effect of reducing competitiveness; to renege on an election pledge; and to turn around the structural change. The Prime Minister is blind on one side; he sees only the revenue side of the Commonwealth accounts. The Business Council completely repudiated that story, and the opposition completely repudiates this bill. We are determined to make sure that this government is held to its promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other parties in other chambers of this parliament once used to say that their role was to keep government honest. Here is their chance. To vote with the government on this bill is essentially to sanction electoral fraud, the dishonest breaking of election promises and the dishonest repudiation of the tax reductions. We in the opposition want to make this clear: we will not vote for tax lies; we will not vote for the repudiation of election promises. We will vote to make sure that the government is held accountable by this side of the House at least. For that reason, we will oppose the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill, which increases company tax to 36 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second bill which is being debated cognately is the Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill. This bill has several different aspects which I would like to deal with in some detail. The coalition opposes some parts of the bill and will vote against some parts in the committee stage. There are other parts of the bill which we do not oppose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, schedule 1 of the bill makes consequential amendments in relation to the rise in the company tax rate. These consequential amendments are designed to ensure that the increase in the company tax rate will not apply to the concessional rates of tax that apply to recognised medium and recognised large credit unions for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 years of income. The coalition has no concerns about this aspect of the bill because it would like to see those concessions restored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should we have thought that the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill&mdash;which puts up the company tax&mdash;would be defeated, we would have opposed this path. We assume, however, that the first bill increasing company tax will go through. If that is the case, there is no need to oppose this schedule which inserts the concession. We want to see concession for recognised medium and recognised large credit unions preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, schedule 2 of the bill amends the income tax law to freeze the rate of tax imposed on the eligible insurance business of friendly societies and other registered organisations at 33 per cent for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 income years. In addition, the rebate applying to taxable bonuses paid on life insurance policies issued by friendly societies will increase to 33 per cent from 1 July 1995 as scheduled and will be maintained at that level for the year beginning 1 July 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has decided to introduce this tax freeze to enable the review of the taxing arrangements that apply to the life insurance business of friendly societies and life assurance companies. However, this review has been under way since 1989 and the legislation does not remove the legislated rise in the tax rate to 39 per cent in 1997-98 and later years. The coalition opposed the increase in the tax on friendly societies and other registered organisations back in 1993. It was yet another case of the violation of the government's electoral mandate. So the coalition will not oppose this freeze. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third part of the bill makes consequential amendments to the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 because of the increase in the sales tax applied to passenger motor vehicles by the sales tax exemptions and classifications modification bills. In his One Nation speech on 26 February 1992, the Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From tomorrow the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent rate will be permanently lowered to 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>This is another one of these permanent structural changes that the Prime Minister used to talk about in his before manifestation that was taken away in his after manifestation. The Prime Minister now dismisses all of those promises with an increase in sales tax on motor cars. Again, this is another feckless repudiation of promises made in an effort to get votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has made it entirely clear, again for the same reason, that it will hold the government accountable for its promises. We will not sit by and let this Prime Minister continue to repudiate his assurances to the Australian people. The coalition opposes the increase in sales tax on motor vehicles because it is another violation of the electoral mandate, and, as a consequence, we will oppose clause 3, part 1 of schedule 3; part 2 of schedule 3; and schedules 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 contained in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth part of this bill amends the old and new sales tax legislation to ensure that the only access to credits or refunds of overpaid sales tax is via the provision of the sales tax law itself. In other words, the government seeks to prevent common law claims for tax refunds outside the wholesale sales tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 and the Sales Tax Amendment (Transitional) Act 1992 to ensure that refunds of sales tax may be obtained only through the procedures prescribed by the provisions. The current sales tax law provides two grounds for the payment of refunds&mdash;refunds of sales tax which were legally payable and refunds of amounts paid as sales tax which were not legally repayable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the amendment is that claimants who do not satisfy the conditions of the two grounds will not be entitled to a refund. Both the current law and the former sales tax legislation contain three-year limitations on claims for refunds and a requirement that the person who bore the tax must actually receive the refund. The amendment will apply to liabilities to pay refunds arising after 7.30 p.m. on 9 May 1995 and liabilities to pay refunds arising at or before 7.30 p.m. on 9 May if legal proceedings to enforce payment of the refunds were commenced after that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that common law remedies should not be closed off; therefore, we will oppose that part of the bill. Common law remedies are entitlements under the law which apply generally. Why should they be closed off in relation to sales tax? This is law as found by the courts in accordance with the principles of jurisprudence, and the coalition cannot see why the statute should close those remedies off. They are the only remedies available at law and the law should not be amended to close them off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final part of the bill deals with removing the sales tax exemption for computer programs on reprogrammable microchips. The bill amends the Sales Tax Assessment Act to limit the tax advantaged computer program concession. Since 1 January 1993 taxpayers have enjoyed a concessional taxable value on a wide range of goods, such as computers, mobile phones and whitegoods, which contain computer programs housed in reprogrammable microchips. Reprogrammable microchips are microchips into which software is not embodied permanently such as erasable programmable read-only and Flash ROM. Software supplied on an erasable program read-only memory or similar device is totally erasable and can be replaced with new software. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been alleged by the government that the exemption has allowed unexpected and large deductions in relation to sales tax. The government maintains that the concession was intended to encourage innovation, but has instead encouraged wastefulness as manufacturers add non-permanent microchips to their goods in order to qualify. When supporting this proposal in the Senate, the coalition indicated that it did so with some reluctance. We know that the government says that this has created an unforeseen anomaly. This is not in the category of a tax violation or a violation of the Prime Minister's promises to the Australian people before the last election; therefore, we will not vote against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do, however, say that the effects of the exemption should be closely monitored. It should not be used to anybody's detriment, if it has a wider effect than anticipated. Given the fact that the government maintains it is but an anomaly, we recognise the right of the government to close down anomalies which would otherwise open wide holes in the administration of the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer indicated in his speech that he will be moving an amendment in relation to the provisional tax uplift factor. Our view in relation to that provisional tax uplift factor is that the government has specified the wrong amount. I will put my case in relation to that when the amendment is moved. We will make our own amendment to that. We will vote against the government's tax lies, and we will oppose those sections of those bills which I have outlined in my speech. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has been untrue to himself but, more importantly, he has condemned the Australian people to pay for his inability&mdash;admittedly, through a speech impediment&mdash;to get his tongue around the truth. President Bush, you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, once told the American people, `Read my lips&mdash;no new taxes.' President Bush broke his pledge to the American people&mdash;and he paid the price. The American people threw him out of the White House at the first chance they got. The Prime Minister had better start packing his bags because the people will get the opportunity to deliver retribution in this country: at the next election they will toss this man out of the Lodge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has broken its promises in terms of income tax, company tax, indirect taxes and any other tax or charge we can care to mention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also goes some way to showing its increased confusion in terms of establishing sound tax policy. The reality is that this government now has no policies. It simply has no policies. It certainly did not have at the last election.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no surprise that, after the election, the Prime Minister called the departmental secretaries into his office and demanded they go back to their departments to produce policies which his government could pursue. That was after the election. So certain was the present Prime Minister that he would lose in 1993 that, after he fell over the electoral finishing line, he had no plans, he had no policies, and he certainly had no vision. Now he wants us to reveal our policies so he can pinch them. He has Buckley's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the rate of company tax is a perfect illustration of the government lacking a policy direction. The government's rhetoric constantly alters, as you know only too well, Mr Deputy Speaker, and its policy positions keep shifting. So it is little wonder that under this regime the business community is banging its head against a brick wall. After all, business needs stability if it is to undertake new investment and strive to compete in new markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1995 amends the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to increase the rate of company tax from 33 per cent to 36 per cent. This increased rate is to apply to most companies and extend to others which are taxed as companies. The amendment will apply from the 1995-96 financial year and to all years thereafter, unless Labor decides to alter the tax rate once again&mdash;or unless we get a coalition government, which will provide some stability and maintain a sense of direction for the tax paying corporate sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995-96 this will mean that government revenues will benefit to the extent of an extra $320 billion. In 1996-97, though, the take increases to $1.570 million dollars&mdash;$1.57 billion. The extra take in 1997-98 will be $940 million, and in 1998-99 it will be back over the magic $1 billion mark to $1.140 billion. The government claims that the compliance cost is negligible, but I will get back to that in a little while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1993-94 budget the government announced that it was reducing the rate of company tax from 39 per cent to 33 per cent&mdash;and how well we all remember that. On 9 February 1993, the Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have decided that the simplest and most effective way to encourage Australian companies to work for Australia is to lower their tax burden.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coming on top of the accelerated depreciation allowances announced in `One Nation', this will make the Australian corporate tax system highly competitive within the OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, more importantly, we will also be competitive with countries in our own region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian companies will thus be better placed to trade with Asia&mdash;the region where it is going to matter most.</PARA>
<PARA>That was all fine and dandy and hard to argue with. Before the 1993 election, the Prime Minister also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of a dynamic East-Asian growth region and with increasing strength in education, training and research and development, Australia is well poised to take advantage of these trends.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our integration into the Asian regional economy, however means that we need to compare ourselves not just with OECD members, but with regional competitors for new manufacturing and large-scale processing facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>Amen to that. The Prime Minister claimed that to aid that integration the government would therefore cut the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. He said this would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . encourage firms to invest out of increased retained earnings and improve the competitiveness of Australia's business tax regime compared with our regional neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA>We agreed with that. In response to a question by the member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) on 18 November 1993 about tax rates in the east Asian economies and about whether Australia's company tax rate is competitive by the standards of the east Asian economies, the then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, replied:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Deputy and Acting Prime Minister indicated, the Prime Minister is on his way to APEC for the APEC leaders' meeting, which is evidence of the increasing economic integration of the nations of the region and, most particularly, a measure of the integration of Australia with many of the countries in that region. It is for that reason that the government has been keen to compare the investment climate in Australia with climates which operate in some of the countries of south-east and north-east Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question refers to comparable company tax rates in the east Asian area. Perhaps it is worth reminding the House of what those rates are for a selected group of companies.</PARA>
<PARA>I admit that, but they are the more advanced industrially, nevertheless. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Japan the company rate of tax is 37 1/2 per cent; Taiwan, 25 per cent; Korea, 36 1/2 per cent; Thailand, 30 per cent; Malaysia, 34 per cent; Indonesia, 35 per cent; Singapore, 30 per cent; and the Philippines, 35 per cent. If one averages those rates which I have mentioned, the unweighted average in these economies would be 33 per cent. That is precisely the rate which now applies in Australia and, therefore, clearly puts Australia very much in touch with these economies on a comparable basis.</PARA>
<PARA>So what are we going to do? We are going to penalise that element of the price component of competition by adding another nearly 10 per cent to the company tax rate. If the words of the Prime Minister and the then Treasurer were true, why do they not apply now? It is a simple question. If their rationale is carried through, are Australian companies now disadvantaged relative to neighbouring Asian countries? If what they said in the first place was true and accurate, then the answer to the question I have just posed is yes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does the government rationalise this increase in company tax? We all know it is only a grubby attempt to increase the revenue flowing into the Treasury coffers, but Labor claims the increase in company tax is justified because the corporate profit share has returned to record highs, companies have benefited from a number of tax concessions such as investment allowances, accelerated depreciation, et cetera, and now that the economy is growing strongly it is appropriate  the corporate sector should pay more tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that profit share as a percentage of gross domestic product has only just risen above 17 per cent. It has only just recovered to where it was in 1989-90. If you examine company tax as a percentage of total income tax, you see that the figure in 1988-89 was 17.2 per cent, in 1994-95 it was 19.5 per cent and in 1995-96 it was 19.8 per cent. From 1990 to 1992 the figure was above 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that when the economy dived into recession it was business tax that took up some of the slack. It was business that was called on once again to make up for the errors of this government. It made a contribution then and is being asked to make another. The fact is that projected company tax revenue in this budget is up by 15.4 per cent compared with an increase in total revenue for the coming year of 12.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is up 15.4 per cent in the corporate sector&mdash;and this at a time when the consumer price index, the measure of inflation, is projected to increase by only four per cent. That is a real increase of 11.4 per cent. In money terms, it is an increase in company tax of $2.29 billion&mdash;$2.29 billion out of the working capital, out of the cash flows, of Australian businesses. Labor is yet again squeezing the business community to pay for its profligacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 12 years of hard Labor, while total revenue increased by 177.8 per cent, company income tax increased by 254.9 per cent and total company tax increased by a whopping 370 per cent. That is the record of 12 or 13 Labor budgets. Over the same period, inflation rose by 68.4 per cent. Company income tax has therefore increased in real terms over the past 12 or 13 budgets by almost 200 per cent and all company taxes by 300 per cent or thereabouts. No wonder the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said on 9 May:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rise in corporate taxation from 33 per cent to 36 per cent will diminish corporate retained earnings and therefore reduce business expansion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was a measure widely foreshadowed and vehemently opposed by the business community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Higher corporate taxes will undermine business confidence at a time when confidence was already falling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This, and other measures taken which will impact on business revenues, will undermine the recovery process.</PARA>
<PARA>This increase in tax means one thing: there will be less investment, not just because of the increase in the tax rate but because of the uncertainty about what the rate will be in 12 months, two years and so on into the future. Labor does not know where it is going, and it has not demonstrated where it might like to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rise in company tax of three per cent will have a negative effect on business and the whole economy. Will business be forced to put up prices or cut costs by laying off staff? What are the implications of the tax rate increase for long-term inflation? All these questions have to be asked by people making decisions now about how to invest and what capital investments to make. Increasing tax burdens have a crippling effect on small businesses at a time when the government informs us that unemployment figures are falling and that our economy is booming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business community needs the government to fix a rate and stick with it. If long-term investment strategies are to be encouraged, then business must be able to reduce as many uncertains as possible in its planning. The commercial world is tough enough out there without our government making things worse. With the original cut in the rate of company tax from 39 to 33 per cent, the government introduced a new quarterly instalment system. Now companies will be hit with a double whammy because they still have to meet the accelerated payment schedules, as well as now paying this higher rate of tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compliance costs in this country are and remain simply the highest by far in the Western world, with the possible exception of the United States. The compliance costs will be higher not only because of the increase in the company tax rate to 36c in the dollar but also because companies will have to maintain three franking accounts, reflecting the tax payable at the three different rates. As Mr Geoffrey Lehmann stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 21 April:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will make a complete joke of the government's so-called tax simplification projects. Labor promises tax cuts, lower compliance costs and simpler tax law. What it actually delivers is the opposite. Is it any wonder that the cost of compliance continues to have a dampening effect on the spirit of innovation and competitiveness of small businesses in this country?</PARA>
<PARA>The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has indicated that we will vote against the bill. The advice of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) is that the government is going to legislate later by way of amendment an increase of the uplift factor to eight per cent. We will also oppose that and propose alternatives. It is passing strange that the uplift factor should be at eight per cent when we have an estimated inflation rate of four per cent and, allegedly, a growing economy with an implied increase in the corporate business take. Why we need the uplift factor to be at eight per cent is beyond me. If it has to be anything it should be around four per cent. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make only a short contribution to this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill and Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill as the subject matter has been well and truly covered already. I pick up on what the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) was saying towards the end of his contribution about the uplift factor. I regarded the whole concept of an uplift factor as objectionable right from the start because it makes certain assumptions, I suppose, about business profitability that just do not stack up out there. To make some assumption on some ad hoc basis, as it obviously is, that because business profits were X last year they are going to be X plus eight per cent in the ensuing year is of great concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Curtin pointed out towards the end of his contribution, there is no firm basis for that eight per cent. There is no apparent justification for it because one of the government's great achievements, it keeps telling us, is a low underlying rate of inflation, about four per cent. So there is certainly no justification that we can see for maintaining that uplift factor at eight per cent for 1995-96 and 10 per cent for later years of income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of debate in this House this week about tax. Our fundamental objection to these proposed changes is that they renege on promises that were made before the last election, iron-clad commitments to the contrary. We are being asked to come in here today, apparently, and vote in favour of changes to taxes which are contrary to what we were told prior to the last election. It has become evident to everyone in Australia by now that this government was largely re-elected on the basis of fraud. We had iron-clad commitments from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that there would be no increases in taxation. I do not know how you interpret that and I am not sure how the people of Australia react to that but he said unequivocally that there would be no tax increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we are faced somewhere down the track with significant tax increases. There might be all sorts of justifications for that. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) comes in and tells us that this is all part of the necessary fiscal tightening. I can accept that argument. I understand entirely that the government has a role in implementing an appropriate fiscal strategy at each budget session. But the point here that is objectionable is that this option was cut off by the Prime Minister prior to the last election. He used it to great effect, in my view. He made political points which obviously were effective. He made the point that there would be no tax increases. He went further and made a great fuss about the fact that there were going to be decreases in personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now see that that has turned out to be a fraud. I hope that during the debates on these taxation issues this week we make the Australian people aware that the Prime Minister and the government have a real credibility problem here. That is what these debates have been about. They have not been about the essential nature of changes to the tax regime. I am sure that any government of the day, and certainly we on this side, would have to consider acting in a fiscally responsible way depending on the circumstances at the time. But this debate, and similar debates, have been about credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we on this side have attempted to highlight in contributions to this debate is that we were promised otherwise. What is the difference between a broken promise and a lie? I submit that there is nothing. What are the Australian people to make of promises which were made to them before the last election that there would be no tax increases? In dealing specifically with company taxes, as we are here this morning, what are we to make of ironclad commitments by the Treasurer that this was to be a permanent reduction to 33 per cent? This was a major plank of the government's policy in the lead-up to the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I think coming out very close to the election and announcing a decrease in the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent was a brilliant move. In my view, it was a very good political move, and of course it was welcomed. The rationale for it was absolutely right&mdash;it was aimed at making us more competitive internationally. One thing that Australia desperately needs is to be competitive on an international basis. That reduction achieved that purpose. The rationale for it was to bring our company tax rates more into line with those of some of our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Treasurer at the time was asked whether this was to be a permanent reduction, he said clearly it would be. There is nothing equivocal about that. There is nothing ambiguous about the word `permanent' as far as I know. In the context of an election these things are done for good reasons. I admit that. I support that. I supported that move because I thought it was a very good political move. But our objection is that in the end the word `permanent' apparently does not have that meaning as far as this government is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer can come in here, as he did the other day, and in answer to a question attempt to weave and duck his way around the meaning of the word `permanent'. He made the point then, and I do not have any problem with this, that the government has the right to change its taxation regime from time to time to make it relevant and to meet the demands of particular circumstances. It may well be that the argument that the reduction was to achieve a purpose at some point does hold water. It may well be that in some people's minds it is now justifiable, although I do not accept that it is, to put up those rates again if the objective for reducing them has been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fact is&mdash;this is the bottom line for all of these debates about tax&mdash;that we were told that it would be otherwise, that it would be a permanent reduction. That is our objection as much as anything to the way these changes to the tax regime have been handled. This debate boils down to one not so much about tax, technical aspects of taxes and our international competitiveness; it simply boils down to the issue of credibility. I do not see, and we did not see the other day when we were debating tax issues, many government members coming in here to debate this issue with us. </PARA>

I make the point that no government member will come in to debate these issues with us because they know they cannot win technically. In a debate about putting up company tax, on a technical level I do not think we can say circumstances have changed. Australia needs to be internationally competitive more so than ever. That was the reason for reducing the company tax rate to 33 per cent. In my opinion, it is an argument for reducing company tax rates further rather than putting them up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, in the end, we have the government totally over a barrel in that this is ultimately an argument about the meaning of words. We are debating the fact that we were told by the Prime Minister there would be no tax increases. We were promised tax cuts. They have not been delivered. You can duck and weave around that one, as the Prime Minister does and as government members do when they dare to come in and debate this, but the fact is that the promised tax cuts, the legislated tax cuts, have not been delivered. Some aspects of them were brought forward but now some have been deferred&mdash;at least, not even deferred; they have now changed totally in the way they will be delivered in the form of contributions towards superannuation somewhere way down the track towards the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate ultimately is about the credibility of a government which goes into an election campaign promising certain things and making certain statements. We had the same debate about the Medicare levy where we were told six months ago&mdash;by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) no less&mdash;that there would be no increase in the Medicare levy. There was no equivocation about it. There was not a door left open, as there might well have been. There could be arguments as to why it should be increased. I suppose, if you want to be technically correct, it ought to be increased to pay for the cost of health care. I know we have had that debate, but the point is that, in this context, we were promised that there would not be an increase. Now we turn around and find there is an increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, in dealing with the increase in company tax, I could easily make a case for why we should be retaining it and  why it should be reduced. But, in the end, our fundamental reason for voting against this increase is our objection to the fraudulent way in which these tax changes have been brought in. We are voting against it to highlight that particular factor so that the Australian people can be aware that we will not be a party to this sort of practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we had had before the election a different approach and a responsible approach where this was not a matter of promises being made and broken, then we may well have accepted it and agreed with the government that there was some fiscal reason for changing these tax rates. We will oppose the rise in the company tax rate because it is a breach of Labor's promise at the election not to increase taxes. We intend to keep the Labor government, if we can&mdash;both here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate&mdash;to its election promises. The government closed the door, it shut off the options for electoral purposes; and it needs to pay the price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people need to be aware that, for the purposes of this government getting re-elected last time, a fraud was perpetrated in the commitments that were given and in the actions taken by the government to cut off those options.

The budget papers say this will result in an increase of around $400 in the cost of an average home. We have clearly demonstrated that that vastly underestimates the cost.

I want to draw that analogy further. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) at the table encourages me to do so. Let us talk in terms of the personal tax breaks that were made law through this parliament prior to the last election. In this respect, we must spell law l-i-e because they never eventuated; they will not eventuate; and this budget does nothing to make them eventuate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us talk in terms of the Commonwealth Bank. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) quite categorically stated at the first issue of shares in the Commonwealth Bank that there would be no reduction in the Commonwealth's 51 per cent ownership rule. But this budget sells the rest off. We had a categorical promise from the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) that there would be no increase in the Medicare levy, but in this budget there is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told that there would be no GST, despite the fact that the Prime Minister thought in 1985-86 that a GST was not a bad idea. At the moment we have the worst and most pernicious form of indirect taxation in the huge increase in sales tax. As I understand it, since the Prime Minister's opposition to the GST in 1993, the sales tax in Australia has more than doubled. This particular budget increases sales tax by a massive 22.3 per cent. As I said, it is in the worst form because it is a blow to small business. I defer again to the sensitivities of the parliamentary secretary at the table and say that there is no reason for the Australian people&mdash;small business, the taxpayers and the battlers of Australia&mdash;to trust the Prime Minister, irrespective of what he says or does before the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just go back to the announcement I read out earlier, which was a policy decision made by the Prime Minister on 9 February 1993. The Prime Minister has the audacity, both here and in the press, to demand the coalition produce its policies now. There we were one month before the last election and his tax policy emerged. Now he has the hide to come and ask us to do better. The policy I am going to the next election with&mdash;and I believe it is the one that will win&mdash;is a policy to get rid of Labor because of the corruption it has spread in this budget and the manner in which it has spread the deliberate misrepresentations of what it intends to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the whole aspect of the budget, as  far as tax is concerned, what the Prime Minister is trying to do&mdash;as we saw him do in the last election&mdash;is make an issue by reducing interest rates. That is the target. He has already achieved a temporary, short-term reduction in interest rates. But the question has to be asked: how, in a budget that has fudged so much to arrive at a surplus, is this going to happen? The $320 million increase in the company tax alone is just one of those fudges that have enabled the government to bring this budget into surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question that has to be asked, particularly in connection with companies, is: are Australian companies now better placed with the Asian trade to be able to afford a three per cent increase in taxation? The Institute of Chartered Accountants in a media release said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government's tax grab in lifting company tax rate by three percent to 36 percent is a shock for the corporate community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">" We always expect company tax to rise, but three per cent is a totally unacceptable increase and will not assist companies in their efforts to continue the recovery from the recession . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">" In addition the new company tax rate puts us totally  out of whack with Asia where Singapore's corporate rate is 27 percent and Indonesia's 30 percent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">" You don't have to be blind freddy to see that this hurts our international competitiveness and our chances to attract overseas investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">" This is particularly difficult when their economies are booming and providing extensive investment alternatives in their home countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">" This makes the tax disadvantage against a country like Indonesia exactly 20 percent."</PARA>
<PARA>The institute went on to say that it could not agree with the tax. It is a damning indictment of where we stand to compete in trade with our Asian countries that Singapore has a corporate tax rate of 27 per cent; Indonesia, 30 per cent; and we now have 36 per cent. Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, I know that you would be very interested in this as you are a person who believes that Australia's way out of its economic problem at the moment is through trade, and we are disadvantaged once again particularly in this investment area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Companies not only have to bear this increase but also have to bear the continuing compliance costs of other Commonwealth taxes such as the capital gains tax; the fringe benefits tax, which is absolutely unintelligible in its present form; and the superannuation guarantee levy. In the last 10 years this government has made an art of accelerating the collection of taxation. It now gets into the government's coffers much earlier in order to maintain this fudged surplus. Taxes would not have been collected in arrears for another 12 months, and yet they are in this taxation pool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other headache companies are going to be faced with is the yet to be announced manner in which the computation of dividends will be handled. It looks as though we will be having three regimes&mdash;39, 33 and 36. An allocation of profits will have to be separately kept, but that is yet to be announced. It would certainly help the companies of Australia if they knew where they stood at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure whether it was an unintended consequence, and it was not highlighted in the budget, but a company that has a closing year prior to 30 June is likely to be paying a company tax rate of 36c in the dollar from its last closure of accounts. For instance, if that date was February or March, that company would now be paying the full rate of 36c. That is retrospectivity; that is taxation by stealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am trying to indicate that the budget itself has a fudged surplus. It is easy enough to get to the amount if you start with the basis that the deficit of this budget is $8.232 billion. If you take off the asset sales, which is selling the Australian family jewels, worth $5.35 billion; the repayment of a state debt, which my own state of Queensland was happy enough to oblige, of $2.22 billion; and the ABS adjustment of $1.378; lo and behold you get an implied surplus of $718 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid that I have to tell the government that no person outside Australia trusts this government to understand that there is a real surplus there. They know we are in debt. They know we are in trouble. As I say, the improvement in the interest rate will be very short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to other aspects of the budget, the Treasurer has said this is an expenditure cutting budget. I will refer to the real figures. Before you reduce it by asset sales, there is a 5.3 per cent increase in expenditure across the broad as against an inflation rate, or whatever you might want to compare it with, of two or three per cent. How is this expenditure paid for? Companies are going to pay 15.4 per cent more, which is $17.14 billion this year; sales tax, as I have already said, is going to collect a massive $14.16 billion, a 22.3 per cent increase; and the total indirect tax rise is some 13.4 per cent. That is where the real deficit is. That is how it has been arrived at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The call will be to get the interest rates down. It does not take into account that real budget deficit. It does not take into account that the current account is going to grind along and continue to produce outcomes of more deficits than Australia can afford, which will have an effect on the interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the exchange rate, as pointed out here the other day by the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), over the last five months the Australian dollar has fallen eight per cent against the US dollar, 10 per cent against the UK pound, 11 per cent against the New Zealand dollar&mdash;and that is an economy that is booming across our way which could teach us a few lessons, if the government cared to look&mdash;16 per cent against the German mark and 22 per cent against the Japanese yen. In amongst all of this, we have the growth of the foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This budget has been manipulated for one reason only: to try to get interest rates down for a sufficiently long period before we go to an election. But nobody out there believes anything this government says. People are still very hesitant about buying a house. This has been compounded by the budget measure to increase some building costs by 12 per cent. This will cause further hesitancy in the housing market. In view of all the Prime Minister's broken promises, I believe that these falling interest rates will be a false dawn and that the reality will come later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer to the uplift factor. I understand that we are going to have an amendment to this legislation. I believe this to be pernicious. It is the means by which this government accelerates the payment of taxation, and in this case the means is the provisional tax uplift factor. It would be interesting to find out what the real situation is because there are still a lot of people out there in small business whom this provisional tax uplift factor will hurt considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> some research on the difference in the amount of taxation paid in Australia by a single person and a family. These figures go back to 1966-67, which is when the change to decimal currency occurred. The research classifies the family as one in which there is only one income earner and two dependent children. The research states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.tax as a proportion of income has increased over time for both groups, with that for the single person increasing by 15.5% to 23.7% and for the family increasing from 5.9% to 16.0%;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the increase has been much greater for the family than for the single person. The family is now paying nearly 2 3/4 times the proportion of income in tax than in 1966-67, while the single person is paying 1 1/2 times;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.in 1988-89, the peak year for tax (as a proportion of income), the family paid 3 1/3 times the percentage in 1966-67 compared with 1 2/3  times for the single person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the marginal tax rate has generally increased over the period: the family's from 22.1 cents in the dollar to 36.9 cents, the single person's from 27.8 cents to 36.9 cents. For both types the rate peaked at 47 cents in 1984-85 and 1985-86;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the proportion of the family's tax to the single person's tax increased from 38% in 1966-67, peaked at over 75% in 1988-89 and had dropped back to 67% for 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA>The schedule quite clearly shows that the proportion of tax paid by those families who have taken the option of having a parent at home to look after the children to the tax paid by a single person has increased from 38 per cent in 1966-67 to 67 per cent now. These people may have been helped if it were not for what the government has deliberately done to defranchise single income families from the benefits which I believe they should be getting but are being denied through excessive taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next election will be fought on the fact that the government makes promises which it does not keep and that it has an excessive ability to fudge the figures and accelerate the collection of taxation, regardless of where it comes from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on members of the government to try to explain to their constituents why on 1 July the cost of houses is going up, the cost of motor cars is increasing by five per cent and sales tax is increasing by one per cent and why the promise of a tax deduction in 1993, which would have been most welcome, has not been forthcoming?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot expect Australians to save when the taxation regime denies them the ability to save. You cannot talk about savings in the form of superannuation because that is a very limited form of saving which does not flow back into the economy and create small businesses and provide the other resources that are so necessary for Australia to get ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention once again the pernicious sales tax that has to be borne by small business in this country. When we have this rate of indirect taxation built into our costs it is no wonder that we are becoming uncompetitive with our Asian neighbours, European countries and other places when they have a VAT arrangement that reduces that level of taxation. When the opposition talked about a proposed GST of 15 per cent the government completely overlooked the compensating factors such as the reduction in many other taxation measures and the increase in pensions. I will be opposing the bill. I believe this is food for thought for the people of Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a few points made in the debate that I want to respond to. The shadow Treasurer, I think it was, asked us to have a look at this government's history on taxes. I am very happy to do that. We did not have much to beat. When we came into government in 1983 we had a taxation system which royal commissioners said&mdash;it was not the government or the opposition that said this&mdash;had optional tax for the rich. They also said that the fastest growing industry was tax avoidance. That is where we started from in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was left to this government to put some respectability back into tax laws. We introduced measures such as a capital gains tax. Australia was one of the few countries in the world that did not have a capital gains tax. We saw what happened when we did not have one. The bottom of the harbour schemes and the money laundering schemes of the 1970s and the 1980s only resulted because we did not have a capital gains tax. We brought that in, with opposition from the Liberal Party and the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax, which is an eminently fair measure, was also opposed by the opposition of the day, but, looking back on it, we wonder how we got by without it. That has allowed us to drop the top tax rate from 60c under the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to 47c; and the bottom tax rate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a few comments made about the company tax rate. Once again, let us have a look at the government's record in that regard. When we came into government the rate was 46 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I never admit anything. I get lessons from the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). We dropped the rate down to 33 per cent. It is going to go back to 36 per cent because this is a responsible budget and there was a need on the fiscal side to do this. What did the opposition say at the last election? The opposition said that the rate would be 42 per cent. We are still six per cent lower than the opposition's figure, with full dividend imputation. Back in the good old days under the Leader of the Opposition we had a company tax rate of 46c. The profits were distributed and they were taxed once again. If you were a top marginal taxpayer you were charged 60c on those dividends. What sort of incentive for investment was that? Nowadays, we have a rate of 36c, with full dividend imputation. We are one of the few countries in the world that have that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear about all the comparisons with our neighbours on the tax rate, and 36c is still competitive. But there are other factors that go into making business decisions about which country to put a business in. These include having an educated work force; the cost of doing business in Australia, which is a fraction of what it is in some of the countries mentioned in this debate; having infrastructure in this country that can handle the investment that is being made with it, which is particularly the case in telecommunications; the living environment for the company executives, which is a big factor in where some of these companies put their investment; and, of course, the political stability of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these factors, as well as the tax rate, go into making Australia a very attractive country in which to invest, and we are seeing that investment. In fact, we see regional headquarters being established here in Australia over and above the countries mentioned by some of the speakers in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that has been made in this debate is that we have relied too heavily on taxing and not on cutting spending. Let me just say that cutting spending is not a one-year exercise. We cannot do it every year and come up with big figures. Let me just state a fact about spending cuts: if we were spending</PARA>
<PARA>money at the same rate as the Leader of the Opposition was when he was Treasurer, we would be spending an extra $17,000 million this year. Since 1983, we have cut $17,000 million, as a percentage of GDP, out of outlays. After making cuts of that magnitude, it is always harder to make more substantial cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was told by Treasury that the easiest way to make cuts is to stop indexation of social security benefits. That will raise a couple of billion dollars a year. Of course, that is what the present opposition did when it was in government. It did not index pensions. It saves a couple of billion dollars a year in today's dollars, but the people who underwrite that are the people who can least afford it. A Labor government would not do that. I am told that sales tax refunds also featured in the debate. The government is of the view that sales tax is not paid by the retailer.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposed Schedule 10, paragraph (a) of the definition of "provisional tax uplift factor", omit "8%", substitute "6%".</PARA>
<PARA>The government's amendment attempts to implement the budget announcement to set the provisional tax uplift factor at eight per cent for 1995-96. Those who do not have tax deducted under PAYE arrangements and pay provisional tax either quarterly or in one instalment will, under the proposal put forward by the government, be assessed for an increase in their income at the rate of eight per cent. The government's proposal assumes that all those people who pay provisional tax will have an eight per cent increase in their income in 1995-96 over 1994-95. They are required to pay tax on this assumed increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have moved an amendment on behalf of the coalition which will set the uplift factor at six per cent for 1995-96. In doing so, the coalition is acting on our commitment to small business and self-funded retirees. There are around 800,000 small businesses and investors who pay provisional tax. They are hit by this budget measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that the uplift factor should be set at a realistic level which is more consistent with expected rates of income growth and inflation. Headline inflation for the year to March is 3.9 per cent. Why then assume that an average income for a provisional taxpayer will rise by eight per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government refuses to nominate the factors, other than the inflation rate, which have been taken into account in setting the uplift factor. Of course, at the end of the day, taxpayers pay taxes assessed on assessable income. If provisional taxpayers' incomes do not rise by eight per cent, they can apply for a variation. But this is an additional administrative burden and carries with it some risk. If provisional taxpayers estimate not within a 15 per cent band, they can be liable for additional tax. Alternatively, they can pay it and claim a credit when they file their 1995-96 return. But the effect of that is to give the tax office the tax in the meantime. The tax paid eventually is evened out, but the cash flow advantage under this flows to the tax office while the cash flow penalty goes to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An inflated uplift factor is a direct assault on small business. Small business has a difficult time as it is in trying to survive. This is not as good as it ever gets. It can get much better. We, as part of our commitment to make it much better for small business, are therefore seeking to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor to six per cent. By maintaining such an unrealistic uplift factor, the Labor government is causing unnecessary cash flow problems for small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisional tax uplift factor has been the subject of much discussion and criticism. Currently, there is a reference before the Senate Economics Reference Committee. Many groups have given compelling evidence for the uplift factor to be examined and reduced. The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants gave evidence that it is hard for its members and advisers to tell small business that the rationale behind an eight per cent increase is an assumption of an eight per cent increase in their income. Everybody would be happy with an eight per cent increase in their income, but the fact is that most do not find it the reality. The society gave evidence that, if there is an uplift factor, it should be in the order of the current level of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Institute of Australia gave evidence to the same effect. The Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation of Australia said that the low inflationary environment of recent times and the determination of the monetary authorities to maintain inflation below three per cent has made a mockery of the federal government's refusal to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We warned at the time of the budget last year that, unless the government could come up with some sensible and coherent reason why this factor should be set at eight per cent, we would be opposing it this time around. The government might say that inflation and an allowance for real growth mean you should have a margin on top of inflation. But, on that, we would be prepared to allow generously six per cent. Eight per cent is just plain greed by the government. Eight per cent is plainly punitive on small business and retirees. Our amendment seeks to reduce the uplift factor to six per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that fails&mdash;and I hope it does not&mdash;we would be forced to vote for the government's amendment, because that is the only way we could get eight per cent. If nothing goes through the House, the uplift factor would actually go back to 10 per cent as a consequence of the way in which the government has structured it. I call on those in this House that support small business, those in this House that support the self-funded retirees and those in this House that believe in taxation equity and freedom, to support a six per cent uplift factor, to make sure that the government does not get the benefit of the cash flow and to make sure that small business is not penalised by greedy government in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to support in the strongest possible terms my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). It is outrageous that business, particularly small business, should be confronted with an uplift factor that was pulled out of the hat, as it were, and set at eight per cent when the government's own budget forecasts anticipate an increase in the consumer price index of four per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eight per cent uplift factor is proposed by the government at a time when it is crowing that the increased share of business profits has been restored to what it sees as desirable. While I and my colleagues on this side do not agree that is the case, it is, nevertheless, another reason to oppose this grubby little tax grab as represented by the proposed uplift factor. I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on behalf of the coalition, is being unduly generous in suggesting that it be at six per cent. It is very hard to justify an uplift factor in excess of the anticipated rate of inflation for the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Profit shares are up to a level which gets the government excited, at least in its rhetoric, but we have to look at this with the background knowledge that the government has increased taxes consistently during the years of its incumbency. For example, company tax increased by more than 300 per cent. That is not a bad effort. That is in real terms. The total business tax take over 13 Labor budgets will have increased by around 370 per cent and, if you adjust for inflation, it is around the 300 per cent I mentioned before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, the government brought forward collections. That is the most insidious of all tax grabs under this government. We now know that quarterly tax instalments have been brought forward at every opportunity and on more than one occasion so that the government is getting the absolute maximum it possibly can. The real problem and the real sin in all of that is that it has made grave inroads into the working capital and into the cash flows of businesses. You cannot underestimate what this has meant in rating the ability of businesses to continue to expand, to continue their efforts to improve performance and to become more competitive&mdash;which would seem to be the objective of the government; but its action, in effect, is entirely counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has made it clear that, while you can apply for a variation of your provisional tax bill, you do run a grave risk. Whilst not many would be that far outside the tolerances allowed by the Australian Taxation Office, not many will take the risk. If they happened to fall outside those tolerances allowed, they would incur very savage penalties which are excessively punitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply want to be on record as supporting 100 per cent the amendment moved by my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but I do have this one small qualification: I think he is being unduly generous in putting his proposed amendment at six per cent. </PARA>

<PARA>Local government is close to the communities it services and has a wide range of representational, executive and community service functions which impact on the quality of life of all Australians. Local government plays an important role in achieving a range of national priorities in the areas of micro-economic reform, urban reform, regional economic development, environment and social justice. In recognition of the importance of local government, the Commonwealth currently provides in excess of $1 billion in grants to local government. These grants are untied, allowing them to be spent by individual local councils in accordance with the priorities they determine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides for the continuation of these untied grants to local councils and for the continuation of their annual escalation formula. The bill also includes important reforms in relation to the transparency and accountability for these grants, including outcomes achieved by local governing bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should emphasise that the bill does not impose conditions on the way in which local governing bodies can spend their grants. Rather it requires that information on the distribution of Commonwealth grants and the performance of recipient local governing bodies be available for scrutiny by this parliament and the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for these reforms arises out of studies undertaken as part of the Australian urban and regional development review and extensive consultation and discussion with state governments, the Australian and state local government associations and individual local governing bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Untied Commonwealth funding to local government has been provided under various acts since 1974. Although the actual arrangements have been subject to various amendments since that time, all Commonwealth governments, no matter what their political persuasion, have recognised its importance to local government and agreed to the funding continuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing act, there are two components to the untied funding. The first is a general grant component which represents around two-thirds of the total financial assistance grants. This funding is allocated between the states and the Northern Territory on a per capita basis, with the intrastate distribution being undertaken primarily on a horizontal equalisation basis; that is, the funding is provided on a basis that ensures that each local governing body in the state or territory is able to function by reasonable effort, at a standard not lower than the average standard of other local governing bodies in the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second component, making up the remaining untied funding, relates to identified local road funding. Prior to 1991, funding for local roads was delivered under tied arrangements. In 1991, this government amended the existing Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 to give effect to the 1990 Special Premiers Conference decision to untie local roads funds and pay these via general purpose grants. These funds are allocated amongst the states and territory on an historical funding basis, with intra state distribution being on a roads needs basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill maintains all these features of the existing act but removes the provision in the current act which would see local road funds absorbed into the general grants with effect from 1995-96. The bill gives effect to the Premiers Conference decision of 11 April 1995 to continue to distribute local road funding on the basis of historical shares rather than having them absorbed into local government general grants and distributed on a per capita basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Absorption of local road funding into the general grants would result in a change in distribution amongst states resulting in significant funding reductions to Western Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and Queensland and would also lead to changes in the intra-state distribution of these funds in all states, which would disadvantage rural and remote areas. The continued separate identification of local road funds has had strong support from local governments and from all state local government ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Escalation of local government funding is determined by the Treasurer in consultation with the responsible minister, having regard to the level of assistance grants and special revenue assistance paid to the states each year. This linkage means that the escalation factor for local government financial assistance grants takes account of inflation and population growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the development of national principles, applicable to all states and the Northern Territory, governing the intra-state distribution of grants. National principles, in lieu of bilateral principles, provide a more nationally consistent and transparent basis for allocating funds to local governing bodies. Application of common principles should ensure, subject to the particular methodologies of the state and territory grants commissions, that similar councils receive similar grants, at least in relative terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National principles will be determined after consultations with the states and territories and the Australian Local Government Association, with a view to reaching a common view on their content. Where there are disagreements the Commonwealth has undertaken to seek the views of the Local Government Ministers Conference. Allocations among local governing bodies will continue to be made by local government grants commissions. The bill contains major enhancements to the accountability arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister will be required to present an annual national report to parliament, replacing the current requirement which only requires presentation of the various state-territory recommendations. The new national report will include information on the grants to individual councils and categories of councils. It will report on state grants commission methodologies in relation to both equalisation and local roads grants, on achievement of horizontal equalisation amongst councils and on council efficiency and effectiveness. The report will also provide information on the operation of the act in relation to service delivery to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that honourable members will welcome the opportunity to be kept informed about the funds paid to local governments in their electorates, and recognise that local government efficiency and effectiveness and service delivery to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are important and legitimate national priorities. Reporting on services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities will not be a simple task. The Commonwealth does not hold most of the information and we will need to work hard and cooperatively to ensure data are comparable and meaningful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard the Commonwealth is pleased to note that local government shares the national objective of ensuring that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have equitable access to services. The Commonwealth particularly welcomes the resolutions of the Local Government Ministers Conference&mdash;including the Australian Local Government Association&mdash;in April this year concerning services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth will consult widely and fully with local government and states in developing data. The bill provides for the act to be reviewed prior to 30 June 2001 and establishes particular issues that such a review must examine. The aim is to ensure the act is delivering the intended reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In developing this bill I have also taken the opportunity to address a number of administrative matters. The moneys under this bill are appropriated to the Department of Housing and Regional Development and paid by that department to the states. This replaces the current provision under which the Treasury makes the payments and is in line with the principle that the department administering the legislation should look after the funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Payments to the Australian Capital Territory are included for the first time, in line with the requirement to treat the ACT in the same manner as all other states and the Northern Territory. Previous local government funding to the ACT was by way of an analogous payment, estimated using the same factors as were applicable to other states. This change does not affect the grant outcomes for the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for an earlier announcement of the estimated funding levels for the coming financial year. This has been done to facilitate announcement of funding in a May, rather than August, budget. The change responds to requests from some states for an earlier announcement to allow for individual council distributions to be included in council rate setting assessments for the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to allow for early announcement, an estimated entitlement for local government funding is determined at the time of the Commonwealth budget, based on the estimated growth in the state general purpose funding. Once estimates have been produced for budget purposes and conveyed to state governments, no further adjustments will occur until the year following the year of payments. Adjustments of these estimates would be done when providing estimates for the next year's budget, with the final entitlement being established when the last payment is determined for state general payments&mdash;that is, by the end of June in any year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change has necessitated altering the formulas included in the bill, but the final funding to local government is still the same as it would have been under the current legislation. The advantage is that local government will know much earlier the level of funding it can expect for the coming year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transitional provisions are included to ensure that the changes to the new legislation will create as little disruption as possible to council distributions. Distributions for 1995-96 will occur as if the current legislation was still in place.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides that the minister may determine, if necessary, and on a state by state basis, phase-in arrangements to take account of the impact on councils of the new national principles. I commend this bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate in the consideration by the House of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill 1995. This is probably the most important piece of legislation affecting local government to come before the House in many years. The bill replaces the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986, under which federal financial assistance grants were provided to local government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill continues current arrangements under which the federal assistance grants are provided in two separately identified categories. The first category is general purpose grants, which are paid on a per capita basis to each state and territory and distributed between councils on a horizontal equalisation basis. The second category is identified local roads grants, which are distributed between the states and territories according to an historical formula based on their relative road needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are indeed a number of useful features of the bill which are an improvement on the current arrangements. I am pleased to see that councils will now be receiving early advice on their annual allocations, which can only assist them in forward planning and in framing their own budgets. It is particularly important for the many local councils out there, at a time when they are trying to become more efficient with their ratepayers' funds, to know well in advance of their own budget considerations what assistance will be coming from the Commonwealth. This reform is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of national principles to govern intrastate distribution of financial assistance grants is a welcome attempt to introduce more consistency in the distribution of these funds. The draft principles, which may or may not be the version finally declared by the Minister for Housing and Regional Development and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), do seem, however, to have been framed with a view to ensuring that there is as little change as possible in the current distribution of funding. While this has the support of the states and local government, it does appear that the national principles are just a continuation of current arrangements with just a little window dressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time, funding for the Australian Capital Territory will be included in the local government financial assistance arrangements. This will replace local government type funding for the territory currently provided through other legislation. It continues the process of putting the territory on the same footing, for Commonwealth funding purposes, as the states and the Northern Territory, and it is a welcome move. I commend the minister for his confidence in the new Liberal administration, under Chief Minister Kate Carnell, which has taken office in the ACT. It is a step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to see that the minister has seen the light and decided not to propose the absorption of the untied local road funds into the general purpose assistance grants. Absorption of the local road funds, which will automatically occur under the current legislation, would have meant that, for the first time, interstate distribution of road funds would have been made on a per capita basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would result in major reductions in the proportion of local road funding provided to Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. The minister has obviously accepted the advice of the recent review of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 which found that absorption of local road grants into the horizontal equalisation process would cause major disruption. The review favoured the continuation of the current funding arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While recognising these positive aspects of the bill, the opposition does have serious problems with a number of its key aspects. These concerns reflect the opposition's broader concerns about the government's approach to local government issues generally. The absence of any real funding commitment to local councils, the shallowness of the government's record of consultation with local government, and its brazen disregard of agreements reached with the other two levels of government are squarely exposed in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also apparent that the bill will do remarkably little towards achieving its stated objectives. The minister's second reading speech is long on rhetoric but when you read the bill you quickly discover the cupboard is bare. A major failing of the bill is that it continues the parlous level of funding for local councils that local governments have become used to. In 1983, when the government came to office, federal general purpose assistance grants to local councils comprised 1.03 per cent of total Commonwealth tax revenues. By 1995-96, this year, the share will have declined to 0.67 per cent. While total tax federal revenues increased by 29 per cent in real terms over this period, the real level of financial assistance grants fell by three per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental problem which confronts councils is that the present government has built into the budgetary framework a level of funding for local government which will be difficult to retrieve in the short term. Although the government has foreshadowed a real terms per capita maintenance of local government funding commencing in 1997-98, this has not been enshrined in the bill. The impact of the funding decline is most felt by rural councils which struggle to be able to provide the essential services that their ratepayers come to expect. The worsening condition of our local road network, declining standards of health care and rising property rates are all consequences of the federal government's shabby treatment of Australia's third tier or third sphere of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other federal programs which assist local government in carrying out its functions, such as the road safety black spots program and the federal urban public transport program, have been abolished under this government. The various state local government associations have written to all federal members of parliament to voice their concerns about the bill. I urge every member to think carefully about the issues raised in these letters by the councils. Their concern is that the bill is seriously flawed in a number of respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local, state and territory governments have also made known their disgust at the way in which this bill ignores key agreements reached between the three levels of government on how the new local government funding arrangements would be implemented. The opposition shares these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to address the particular aspects of the bill with which we on this side take issue. They include, firstly, the failure of the bill to require the government to consult with local government on the preparation of the national principles for the interstate distribution of the financial assistance grants. Secondly, there is the absence of any parliamentary oversight of the federal minister's power to declare national principles for the distribution of financial assistance grants. Thirdly, there is the failure of the bill to require the minister to consult with the states and local government in the preparation of the report to parliament on the operation of the legislation. I foreshadow that at the detail stage of the consideration of this bill I will move amendments to remedy these defects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major feature of the bill is the inclusion for the first time of specific objects. These objects include improving the provision by local councils of services to Aboriginal communities and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of local councils. No member of this House could disagree with these aims. But when you read the legislation to try to discover how these objectives will be achieved you are left none the wiser. The bill provides no strategy to promote the achievement of these objectives. However, the minister will be required to report to parliament annually on how councils have met the objectives specified for them in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time, in relation to local government payments the federal minister will be required to table in parliament an annual report on the operation of the financial assistance grants legislation. This will include the extent to which the funds have been allocated on a horizontal equalisation basis and on the performance by councils of their functions, including their efficiency and provision of council services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Local Government Association and the state and territory ministers believe the government provided a firm undertaking that any reporting arrangements were to be made to the Local Government Ministers Conference. The federal government had agreed that reporting on councils' performance would be dealt with under the auspices of the regular Local Government Ministers Conference meetings rather than to parliament in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no agreement on the form which the report should take or on the detail of the benchmarking arrangements to be implemented. These issues were to be the subject of further investigation by officials, with advice to the ministers next year. I give notice that I will move an amendment requiring the federal minister to consult with relevant state ministers and local government in the preparation of the report to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the issue of improved service to Aboriginal communities, the Local Government Ministers Conference decided that agreements would be negotiated between the states, territories, state local government associations and the Commonwealth on how best to deliver improved services to Aboriginal communities. These agreements would involve complementary action by other spheres of government where necessary and additional assistance provided to councils identified as needing to improve their performance. None of this, however, is reflected in the bill, which puts the onus on councils to redress problems of many years standing without one cent of additional federal funding. It is tragic that the Deputy Prime Minister has sought to pass the buck in this way on such an important problem that the nation must address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems faced by Aboriginal communities require an expanded whole-of-government effort. Local government does not have the capacity to do a great deal more without substantial additional funding, none of which is provided in this bill. It is also not appropriate to focus on one disadvantaged group in the community. Other groups with special needs could have been singled out for attention, such as migrants from non-English-speaking backgrounds, people with disabilities, people in remote communities, the unemployed and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also runs the risk of compromising the whole basis of federal local government funding. Federal grants to local government are currently untied. The principle until now has always been that what councils do with the money must remain a matter for the democratic process at a local level. Instead, this bill in effect converts the general purpose funding into tied funding rather than establishing a targeted program to achieve the sensible objectives specified in the bill. To quote the Australian Local Government Association, this aspect of the bill seriously undermines the concept of untied general purpose grants. The opposition does not intend at this stage to move amendments remedying these aspects of the bill. The question of services to Aboriginal communities can only be addressed through a coordinated program which will require the assistance of and action on the part of many government agencies at state and federal level. As I said earlier, the objectives are fine but the bill on its own cannot provide the solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broken promises I have referred to above cast a poor light on the special agreement between the federal government and local government which has been heralded by the minister as a new Commonwealth-local government accord. It is ironic that, in the same week the minister announced his intention to develop the accord, local government was telling the world that the government had broken key agreements on the content of this legislation, including failure to incorporate key consultative mechanisms in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is really symptomatic of the minister's whole approach to his portfolio. On so many issues of concern to Australia's 741 municipalities, the government's promised consultation is revealed as just empty promises. On this issue, like so many others where fine words fail to translate into action, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development is an emperor embarrassed by his nakedness. When it really comes to the crunch, the government's so-called commitment to consultation with local government really is just a sham. According to the Australian Local Government Association, the bill fails to implement agreements reached at conferences of local government ministers, including the Australian Local Government Association president. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have had these agreements with state ministers. We have had these agreements with the Australian Local Government Association, which is the representative body of local governments right across this country. And now we have the minister going around the country saying, `We are going to have this new accord with local government. Everything is fine and rosy and we are going to get on so well in this great big family all working together. And this third sphere of government in this country is going to be onside with the government all the way.' Yet, when we get this bill into the House, what do we find? The minister has reneged on some of those agreements that he made with the ministers, that he made at the meetings with the Australian Local Government Association, and, more importantly, with the President of the Australian Local Government Association. The so-called accord quite clearly is something which has broken down before it even begins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be bad enough if the government's dismissive treatment of local government were confined to this bill, but it is just one of a long series of occasions on which the government has ignored or disregarded the interests of local government. I note that the proposed accord is likely to address local government's role in progressing national competition policy, for instance. It seems to me that the government's position on this issue is pretty well fixed and local government does not fare well. Local government has not been included in the system of competition payments agreed at the Council of Australian Governments. Moreover, the intergovernment competition principles agreement does not provide for state and Commonwealth business enterprises to pay local government rates and charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The threshold problem is that the government refused to allow the Industry Commission to investigate the extent of local government's contribution to the benefits flowing from the competition policy reforms, or to examine the impact of reforms on local communities. Why would the government refuse to allow the Industry Commission to investigate the impact of a national competition policy on local government? We would love to hear the answer from the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also reflective of the shallowness of the government's commitment to consultation that local government had an enormous battle just to gain representation on the intergovernmental working parties set up to progress the mechanisms to implement the Hilmer reform. It was not until the Council of Australian Governments meeting in Darwin that they got one representative on that body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much for this great accord. So much for this great partnership. Local governments have one voice, and they have to fight tooth and nail to be acknowledged as a partner in governance. They will have to play a part in national competition reforms, and they are happy to play their part. They believe they have a fair case in arguing that they need to be heard far more on the concerns they have in terms of progressing national competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the belated announcement on this issue made this week by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in response to the opposition's pressure. He announced that he would seek a parliamentary inquiry into how community service obligations can best be continued under the Hilmer regime. This is a sign that the government is starting, at long last, to listen to the concerns of local&mdash;particularly rural&mdash;communities about how the benefits of national competition reform can be most fairly distributed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the Assistant Treasurer's reference to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. I understand that the committee has accepted the guidelines and the references that he has made to the committee. At long last&mdash;and only through the pressure that has come from this side of the House&mdash;we are going to see some progress in that area. It is a very, very important area&mdash;</PARA>

That could have allayed some of the anxiety felt in local communities&mdash;particularly those in rural areas. Quite clearly, it is this side of the House that understands the concerns of the people who live, work and generate wealth and jobs out there in rural Australia. This is where the pressure has come from on this issue. At long last, the government is showing some signs of having listened to our voice from this side of the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given this background of official neglect, councils could be forgiven for being more than a little cynical about the minister's wish that the proposed accord establish common ground between the Commonwealth and local government on competition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties faced by the opposition in considering its approach to this legislation is a complete lack of any explanation provided by the minister on the rationale of many of its provisions. The whole question of federal funding for local government was addressed in two recent reports by the Australian Urban and Regional Development review, namely <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financing local government </EMPHASIS>and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Local government funding methodologies</EMPHASIS>. These reports made a whole series of recommendations, some of which have apparently been adopted by the minister and many of which have not. This is of more than academic interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Local Government Ministers Conference last year, the Deputy Prime Minister advocated arrangements to encourage and improve local council efficiency. His proposals were very different from the damp squib he has presented in this bill today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those recommendations flowed out of the reports mentioned above. However, the Deputy Prime Minister was comprehensively rolled by the states and local government on these proposals, and they have since vanished without trace and without any public explanation by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this point, the government has had before it, for more than 18 months, the findings of a report prepared by the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Driving the road dollar further</EMPHASIS>. The government has still not provided an official response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report made a number of recommendations about federal untied local road funding, most of which have not been incorporated by the government in this bill.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the unforgivable absence of any government response to this report, we are none the wiser as to why the government has done this. This is public administration at its sloppiest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that primary responsibility for tabling the government's response rests with the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). Our advice from his department is that he does not have time to attend to the report, given other matters that demand his attention. We know what those other demands are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, I call on the Deputy Prime Minister to prevail on the transport minister and get him to do his duty by this House and table the government's response to this report. At the very least, the Deputy Prime Minister should outline his response to the issues addressed by the committee within his own portfolio responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is also concerned at the apparently fragmented nature of the government's local government assistance program.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the minister for incorporating a number of these disparate programs into the local government development program. But the cost has apparently been a substantial increase in staffing levels of the Office of Local Government. Scarce local government resources should be devoted to providing services at a local level, not in expanding the Commonwealth bureaucracy. The minister might explain whether an expanded bureaucracy will be more efficient, or whether this staffing increase is really necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some local government associations have expressed the view that this represents a further attempt by the minister to extend his control over the activities of local government. The opposition finds it very difficult to disagree with local government's assessment of this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have concerns about the local government development program itself, which, as it is funded under a one-line entry in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1), is administered with very little parliamentary supervision. It is not clear why the funding for and administration of this program would not be more effectively dealt with in local government financial assistance legislation. This is a matter I intend to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of the Senate estimates hearings, the opposition has asked a number of questions on these and other issues, which are intended to assist its consideration of this bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Prime Minister has worked tirelessly to encourage better planning and urban renewal in local communities. He has regarded local government as an appropriate vehicle for the expansion of community services.

He has encouraged them to take an active role in local environmental affairs. His record before this House in supporting local government in Australia is second to none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with great interest to the comments of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). The honourable member for Maranoa would have been a great supporter of Fightback. I think it was Fightback which sought to slash and emasculate federal government funding to local government in this country. I do not understand how that particular view stacks up with the honourable member's criticism of the present government's funding arrangements for local government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Maranoa had a lot to say about consultation with local and state governments on these issues. I do not know where he has been, but he should know that the Deputy Prime Minister, more than anybody else in this place, has an excellent record of consultation on these sorts of issues, not only with caucus and with his ministerial colleagues, but also with local and state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know how the Liberal Party of Australia, which the honourable member represents here in the coalition, approaches the consultative process when it comes to local government. I would like to invite the honourable member to come to Victoria and see what the Kennett government has done in terms of consulting with local government. The Kennett government has taken the meat axe to local government in the state of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kennett government has imposed its commissars&mdash;not commissioners&mdash;to run local government in the state of Victoria without consulting with local communities. That is why the opposition is losing so much support in the Liberal and National Party heartlands. Those communities are turning in droves to the government because the Liberal and National parties refuse to consult. They have treated local government just like a bag of spuds&mdash;ripping the bag open and tipping the spuds on the ground. Members opposite do not care about consultation, so they should not come into this House preaching to the government, least of all preaching to the Deputy Prime Minister, about consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought a funding commitment of in excess of $1 billion was significant. I would have thought the attempts that are being made in this particular act to bring local government into the transparency and accountability fold would have been an appropriate course for a federal government allocating that amount of money. However, that does not seem to have impressed the honourable member for Maranoa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has consistently walked away from the issue of micro-economic reform, not only in local government areas, but in transport and in the provision of many other services.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Maranoa should know that on this side of the House there is very strong support for local government structures in this country. I just had a flick through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Handbook of the Commonwealth of Australia</EMPHASIS> and I discovered that some 20 members on this side of the House have had experience in local government, including you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have also had such experience. I will not name all the government members who have local government experience, but the list includes the honourable members for Calare (Mr Simmons), Werriwa (Mr Latham), Herbert (Mr Lindsay), Dickson (Mr Lavarch), Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), Chifley (Mr Price), and Hughes (Mr Tickner). The Speaker has also had experience in local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House take great exception to the charges by the member for Maranoa that this government does not have a great deal of sympathy for this level of government. We know where his sympathies lie. His sympathies have always been with state governments, never with local governments. It has been federal Labor governments that have shown the care and the concern for the real development of governmental structures at the local level and an interest in improving this level of government as a deliverer of services to ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the linkages between the federal Labor government and local government are examined via the various programs that we administer it gives a fairly comprehensive idea of how seriously the federal government takes this level of government. The member for Maranoa mentioned the local capital works program, an astounding initiative in One Nation that not only achieved great infrastructure improvements at the local level but also was an employment creating program. There was a great sigh of relief when One Nation was announced. The government committed over $400 million in direct funding to local government so that local communities could be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have linkages through the landcare and environment action program, LEAP, as well as a myriad of labour market programs. As far as infrastructure development is concerned, the building better cities program works in partnership not only with local government but also with state government. That program has been a resounding success. Some $800 million that the federal government made available primarily to local governments has brought forth an investment of some $2 billion&mdash;an extraordinary result in investment terms, but it has been far more important to local communities given what has been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my community in Geelong, the building better cities money has been used to finance the redevelopment of the Deakin wool stores, an urban renewal project in the north of Geelong at Norlane and the building of the Geelong transport interchange&mdash;all key catalytic developments in the city of greater Geelong. Those projects had called for substantial investment and they have improved the infrastructure of our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But our linkages with local government do not end there. I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister for the way in which he has crafted the regional development program and initiated the greater involvement of local communities into their own economic development. If we go to environmental programs, we see in the budget that $8.5 million has been provided to assist local governments primarily to deal with planning issues related to the coastal environment. As far as general planning issues are concerned, the ILAP program provides a good linkage. The federal government is involved not only in the HACC program to a very large extent in the provision of community services but also with local communities in the provision of community housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these programs are being accessed by local government then the federal government, in partnership with local government, is having a very real impact on the lives of ordinary Australians. They are hardly the programs and the actions of a government that does not care about partnership with local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look back at the historical perspectives, it is important to appreciate that local government existed long before Federation; indeed, local governments in my state of Victoria were established in 1842. These local structures grew up under state jurisdictions and it is state legislation that primarily governs the functions, powers and structures of local government in the state of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian constitution does not specifically mention local government, and this fact has led to some attempts in the past by the federal government of the day to increase its constitutional status. But it is the Labor governments which have done that: no coalition government has attempted to elevate local government structures in the federation. Indeed, the coalition opposed the Whitlam government referendum on the matter in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see that the honourable member for Maranoa is shaking his head. He should not shake it, because the coalition opposed the 1974 referendum which sought to give local government a greater say in the affairs of the nation and attempted to allow the federal government to directly fund it. Yet opposition members come into this House and lecture us about our commitment to local government. They have got to be joking! The functions that local government performs are very important to local communities. Local government structures are involved in the provision of local roads, the provision of water supplies and sanitation, and&mdash;more extensively now, in modern times&mdash;in the provision of cultural and recreational activities and community and welfare services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who has stood beside local governments as they have moved into these critical areas of development? State governments, or federal governments? I can tell you what the state government in Victoria has done, and it is nothing like the federal Labor government has done for local government. Looking at the financing of local government, we see that local government largely raises its revenue through three mechanisms: through taxation and the levying of rates; through borrowings; and through grants which are provided by the federal government. That brings me to the substance of the bill that we are debating here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the role of the federal government in local government funding in Australia began with the Grants Commission Act in 1973, which directly led to the funding of local government. Moving further along the time scale, I commend the Fraser Liberal government which, in 1976, provided for personal income tax sharing by local governments in the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976. In 1986, the Hawke government introduced the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act, which outlined the program for growth in local government funding and introduced a system of state allocations on a per capita basis with the principle of horizontal equalisation. The 1991 amendment to that act provided Commonwealth funding for local roads. Of course, we have before us a range of amendments which further extend that 1986 act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before this House today provides for several of the government's objectives in allocating $1.1 billion of federal moneys to local government. The government seeks greater efficiencies in the use of that money and, of course, greater accountability in the allocation of funds. The bill seeks to achieve this through the introduction of a new method of national reporting on local government expenditures, through the establishment of a more consistent basis for the allocation of funds between municipalities. The bill provides a means by which local communities can achieve those greater efficiencies and, of course, it continues the separate identification of road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not deal with all of the bill's provisions. I will pick up on just a couple of aspects and, no doubt, government members following will pick up on the others. As far as the national reporting mechanism is concerned, there is a necessity to provide greater transparency and accountability in the distribution of funds. I do not think that would be disputed by the honourable member for Maranoa. The bill before the House requires the minister to provide a detailed report to the parliament on expenditures and especially on the outcomes of those expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing about the expenditure report is that it will provide an impetus and a focus for the further collection of essential data relating to local government areas throughout the length and breadth of this country. Much of that data is already in existence, but it needs extending for us to be able to get the best possible snapshot of what is happening with those expenditures and the outcomes being achieved. The fact that the national reporting mechanism will impose its own discipline over local government bodies will be an incentive for them to improve their performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there will be difficulties in obtaining agreement from local and state governments on what constitutes good performance and establishing relevant criteria. It is a hard job but it can be done, and it can be done within a consultative framework. It will provide the federal government with a better statistical base and a better indication of how that enormous amount of money is effectively spent and it will give the citizens of Australia a better chance to evaluate the outcomes of their local government bodies. That first report will be made and published in the national parliament in 1996-97. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my time runs out in this debate, let me just challenge the opposition once again. When opposition members get up in this place and seek to lecture this government on local government matters, we should bear in mind that they have always had their focus directed at state governments and not local governments. They have consistently, down through history, opposed the attempts of Labor government to elevate the status of local governments in the Australian constitutional context. If we go to the one state where we can view the Liberal Party in operation, we find that what the Liberal Party has done in Victoria is one of the most despicable and undemocratic things that we have seen in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a political party and a coalition partner, the Liberal Party has demonstrated its utter contempt for consultative processes.

So, when opposition members come into this place and seek to lecture the federal government on what it ought to be doing with local government, they are really skating on thin ice. The honourable member for Maranoa ought to be reminded that if he was on this side of the House local governments throughout the length and breadth of Australia would already have had their financial innards slowly ripped out as the squeeze from Fightback would have come on the funding arrangements between the federal and state governments. </PARA>

I suppose that members on the other side can also say that about members on this side. We have just had a bit of a lesson from the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) about some recent activities that have taken place in Victoria which have had extensive ramifications as far as local government is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just take the House back, seeing we are talking about some history today in debating the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill 1995, to the early 1980s in New South Wales when we had the massive amalgamations of local government. I presume what the member for Corio was talking about was the amalgamations of local government bodies in Victoria at the moment. A lot of the New South Wales amalgamations were contrary to the recommendations of all those local government bodies in the state. Under whose stewardship was this? The minister for local government at the time was one Harry Jensen, a member of the Wran Labor government. That was in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Corio spoke about lack of consultation in Victoria at the moment. That may be the case, but certainly there is a fair bit of blame that we can level at the other side of politics in that process. Over the years, there have been a number of times that different governments in New South Wales have meddled with the Newcastle City Council&mdash;as you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;the Sydney City Council and the South Sydney City Council. So the Labor Party in Australia is certainly not without blame, and it should not stand inside this glasshouse and throw those sorts of stones at the coalition about the way reform has taken place and the effects of that reform on local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financing process of local government is a very important element of the federal way that we run this country. It is interesting to listen to some of the comments and to still hear, 2 1/2 years later, about some of the elements of Fightback, even though that manifesto is dead and buried. The Labor Party is very concerned and it is chomping at the bit to have a crack at the policy that we will go to the next election with. Well, it is just going to have to wait a bit longer. It certainly will be a comprehensive policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a personal note, I certainly acknowledge the very important existence of local government in the three-tiered system in Australia. It is a level of government that we certainly cannot take too lightly. I believe that, over the years, we have seen a diminution of the recognition of local government. There was a referendum question on the constitutional recognition of local government and, at the time, I was a member of local government, not a member of this place. I was certainly personally concerned that that referendum question did not get up, because local government in Australia deserves constitutional recognition. It is absolutely important to the wellbeing of the taxpayers and the ratepayers in local government areas. Local government provides a lot of the daily services that we require, need and expect and it does so, I would dare say, in the most efficient manner of any level of government. I know I will draw a bit of criticism on that point, but I do believe that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill 1995 replaces the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 under which federal financial assistance grants&mdash;FAGs&mdash;are provided to local government. Under present arrangements, FAGs are provided in two separately identified categories. Firstly, general purpose grants are paid on a per capita basis to each state and territory, and the funds are distributed between councils by local government grants commissions on a horizontal equalisation basis. Secondly, identified local roads grants are distributed between the states and territories according to a historical formula based on their relative road needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until 1990-91, these grants were in the form of tied grants for local roads and were channelled through the transport portfolio. The local road funds were untied in 1991-92, but they remain separately identified. The intrastate distribution of these funds is carried out by the local government grants commissions according to principles which vary between states, but which generally reflect, to a greater or lesser extent, factors such as road length, population and maintenance requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this bill we are debating today, the general purpose and roads grants will continue to be separately identified, that is, the method of interstate distribution will not be affected. However, the intrastate distribution by local government grants commissions will be performed on the basis of national principles declared by the federal minister, instead of according to different principles in place in each state and territory. Prior to 1990-91, there was an element of road funding channelled directly from the Commonwealth to local authorities under a number of different programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One that immediately comes to mind is the Australian land transport program, which I know the council that I was a member of at the time used very efficiently and effectively in upgrading our network of economically important road infrastructure. We were able to take every single dollar that came through that program from the Commonwealth and apply it directly to road improvement, and we managed to get many hundreds of kilometres of very important road infrastructure in our council area improved to the level where it needs only minimal maintenance today. It was a very important program, one that was recognised throughout local government as being a very good program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which is conducting an inquiry into the relationship between the Commonwealth and states as far as special purpose payments are concerned. There has been some criticism of the Commonwealth on the growth of SPPs and the concept that that may be moving to more of a centralist position rather than a federalist position. In this particular area, that of road funding, to a certain extent my personal view is a centralist view in that I believe that some of the benefits that were attained back in those days, before 1991, are not being attained today. We are not achieving the dollars in real terms on our roads in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inventory of bridge infrastructure and the state of that bridge infrastructure are absolutely appalling. I do not know where the money is going to come from but ultimately it has got to come from the Commonwealth, as the prime taxing body in Australia, to local government to renew or to renovate that bridge infrastructure in rural Australia. Bridges in my area are approaching 60, 70 or 80 years old, all of timber construction, and local government just does not have the wherewithal to provide the funding to replace those bridges. I know that there have been a number in my area that recently received funding from the former government in New South Wales using new technology as far as stress laminated panelling is concerned, putting new decking on bridges, and they have done a good job. Some have had to be reconstructed. I know the Hastings council recently negotiated to make funds available to repair the Kindee bridge in the upper Hastings area, but there are hundreds and hundreds more that are not going to get funding from that area because local government does not have the resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tier of government, the Commonwealth, collects an enormous amount of revenue from fuel taxes, around $10 billion. This year I think we are seeing about $867 million spent on the roads in this nation, and it is not really good enough. The point that I am making today is that we are fiddling around the edges here. I would like to see a little more attention paid by the Commonwealth to that crisis situation. If you look at the inventory of road infrastructure in a local government area in a city, the K and G is in and there is a blacktop on the road. Everything is done; there are just maintenance programs. We have got roads that are of vital importance in rural and regional Australia that are in a deplorable state, with gravel surfaces. Councils cannot afford to resheet and roll those roads. A fair dinkum program with a continuing injection of capital going into local government would certainly improve that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I got some correspondence from the Australian Local Government Association with regard to this bill, highlighting some areas where it believed the bill was deficient, and I might just refer to that briefly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Member</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On May 10 the Minister of Housing and Regional Development introduced the new Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill to continue the payment of untied Commonwealth grants to Councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We welcome much of the Bill, and acknowledge the extensive consultation which has occurred with Local Government during drafting. The Minister has responded positively to a number of Local Government requests&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>And that needs to be put on the record. I concur with the comments that are being made by David Plumridge, who is the signatory of this letter. But he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regrettably, however, the Bill is seriously flawed in a number of respects. It fails to implement various agreements reached at conferences of Local Government Ministers held in October 1994 and this April, and contains provisions which are inconsistent with a system of untied, general purpose grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sections of the Bill causing concern are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. section 6, which sets out the procedure for establishing national principles to guide the allocation of grants amongst Councils</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. section 16, which requires annual reports to Parliament</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. section 3, which sets out the intended objects of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Principles</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local Government Ministers, including the Commonwealth, agreed at the Conference that the national principles should be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. formulated in consultation with State Ministers and the Australian Local Government Association (ALGA)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. take the form of a disallowable instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill fails to implement this agreement. There is no reference to consultation with ALGA and the Minister can simply formulate, revoke, or vary principles `in writing'. There is no requirement for consultation at all when the Minister revokes or varies principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Annual Reports</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 16(2)(c) goes beyond the agreement reached with respect to reports to Parliament. State Ministers and ALGA took the view that reporting on the performance of Councils should be to the Local Government Ministers Conference, not Parliament. There has been no agreement as yet on the form which such reports should take, and the issue is to be the subject of further investigation by the officials and advice to Ministers next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of the bill are therefore at best premature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Objects</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sections 3(2)(d) and (e) are inappropriate in the context of legislation for untied, general purpose grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the grants is to enhance the capacity of Councils to provide a range of services to communities in an equitable manner. Decisions as to precisely how funds are to be spent must remain a matter for each Council. Specific references to improving efficiency and services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are inconsistent with the `horizontal equalisation' and `effort neutral' approaches set out in subsequent sections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Association is in no way opposed to steps being taken to improve the efficiency of Councils and services to ATSI communities. In fact, agreement was reached at the April Local Government Ministers Conference on programs of activity to achieve both those objectives. There is simply no need for them to be raised in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of ATSI communities, it was agreed that one of the national principles would refer to their particular needs. To go further and make the improvement of services a specific object of the Bill can only raise unsustainable expectations that such improvements will occur. This is a dangerous and potentially divisive course of action, especially given that the Bill does not and cannot provide any special funding for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only a tiny fraction of the grants received by Councils relate to the needs of ATSI communities, and it has never before been suggested that general purpose grants to Councils are a significant part of the solution to the very real problems of our indigenous people. Substantial additional resources and concerted action by all three spheres of government are required to achieve better outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our underlying concern is that once this Act refers to one particular group with special needs, others will inevitably seek similar treatment. Local Government has broad social justice responsibilities and it is wrong to focus so strongly on just one section of the population, albeit arguably the most disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Local Government Association wrote to the Minister seeking amendments to address these concerns, but our approach was rejected. Details of the amendments we now propose are attached.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say&mdash;and I will have to put this on the record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to acknowledge the valuable assistance received from the office of Mr Bruce Scott MP, Shadow Minister for Local Government, in drafting those amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would greatly appreciate your support.</PARA>
<PARA>I was a very committed member of local government for a number years, as was the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) who is in the chamber now. We both, regrettably, had to resign from local government on that fateful day in 1993. It was a sad day for me, because it had been a great learning experience and a great period of involvement in local affairs. I believe the government has to recognise and take on board some of the comments that that peak body has given the minister. That body certainly acknowledges the consultation that the minister had with it and, obviously, it is the minister's prerogative from that point onwards in drafting this legislation as to what elements of its recommendations he takes on board. We acknowledge that it is the minister's prerogative to do that, but we certainly do not have to agree with it. So I thought it was important that that correspondence and those sentiments from the Australian Local Government Association be put on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In closing, I wish to reiterate some comments that I made with regard to local road funding, in order to flag to the government that it is not a problem that will go away. It is not a problem that we can palm off onto state government. It is something that must be addressed and that we must face up to. The Commonwealth, as the body that receives the majority of the revenue income in this nation by way of taxes and other receipts, should address the problem that is growing at a rapid rate in rural and regional Australia: the problem of our roads. The problem will not go away, and we will certainly have to pay attention to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At some stage in the future, this government or a future coalition government is going to have to address that matter, either by way of SPPs that are made directly through state governments and are earmarked to go to local roads, or else by going back to the system in place prior to 1990-91, whereby funding came directly from the Commonwealth to local government. I have absolutely no problem with that, because&mdash;speaking as one who was a member of local government at that time&mdash;I believe that the people who paid the taxes which ended up back in local government got the best value for their dollar from local government with those roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that some of my colleagues on this side of the chamber might not necessarily agree with me, but that is my personal view. If we end up back in that situation, I believe we will get more kilometres of road sealed. Certainly, if a government in the future decides that it will address the problem by way of SPPs through state governments, that is fine; but the issue of rural and regional roads is not going to go away, and this is the forum that really has to address it. The Commonwealth government has ultimately to provide the funding to address those very serious infrastructure issues in rural and regional Australia. </PARA>

Local government is certainly very close to the people, and that gives a great opportunity for people in local government to really get to know people and issues. It also takes the wind out of one's sails if one feels a bit high and mighty and is thinking of being just a policy person. One has to be a very practical person in local government, so I am very grateful for the experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my period in local government, I also chaired my council's finance committee. Being thrown in at the deep end with my first budget was a pretty traumatic experience. I come from an area which has a fairly low rate base because it does not have a lot of large industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As did the member for Lyne, I will talk about roads because they are extremely important.

After listening to the member for Flinders raving about those particular issues, as far as I am concerned he has absolutely no credibility on anything he does.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know it is not part of this bill, but I think it is worth alluding to the additional grant funds for local government projects in this year's budget. There will be an extra $48 million over four years, putting the grants together rather than in different categories. This has given a lot more flexibility to local government. The two main local governments in my area depend very heavily on those grants because, as I have said, they have a very low rate base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take issue with the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) about the supposed lack of consultation. I am thankful to the member for Lyne for reading that paragraph from the Australian Local Government Association's letter. I will repeat it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We welcome much of the Bill, and acknowledge the extensive consultation which has occurred with Local Government during drafting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister has responded positively to a number of Local Government's requests.</PARA>
<PARA>I note that it says `during drafting'&mdash;not after. That letter says very clearly&mdash;and I know it was the case&mdash;that there was extensive consultation with the association and that it had an input into the bill. In this letter which we have all just received, the association disagrees with some things, but it does not say that there was no consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end result of consultation is not that all parties are going to get everything they want. I have stood up in this place a number of times and talked on bills where the opposition members have said, `We weren't consulted' or `The interest groups were not consulted.' However, when I have talked to ministers and to their officers, I have found out that extensive consultations did take place. So that is an absolute furphy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National reporting is an extremely important part of this bill. It goes a long way towards making local governments more responsive and making their actions more transparent. Again, I have to emphasise that this is not something that the federal government is going to get and hold to its bosom and do nothing with. It is going to go to the Local Government Ministers Conference. The state and federal ministers will be looking at national reporting. Everyone will have a chance, once again, to have an input. I think those issues are very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some councils, as we know, work extremely efficiently and others are a bit slack. The national reporting, the efficiency measures and the benchmarking will go a long way towards pulling into line the local government authorities that have not been efficient. As a result, they will produce a better product for their ratepayers and their local residents. Local government is the level of government which people love to hate the most. Local papers, like mine, are full of criticism of local government. Occasionally there is praise, but when something good happens the papers very seldom give local governments a pat on the back, but they are into them like Flynn if they have not done something the people want done. So I think better reporting, better benchmarking, will be a step forward in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree entirely with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on the road funding issue. Like your electorate, a lot of my electorate is rural&mdash;although probably not to the same extent. In the Blue Mountains part of my electorate there were lots of housing developments before the section 94 contributions were required to put in kerbing, guttering, roads and so on. The local government authority has always been behind the eight ball in sealing those roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury in my electorate are environmentally sensitive areas, not having roads sealed is detrimental to the environment as well as a great inconvenience to the residents. We were fortunate to get a $10 million grant from the last state government. I do not mind giving some praise to a conservative government for doing that. It was to the credit of our then city engineer who, over a number of years, browbeat and got that grant. Trying to work out which roads were to be sealed first was not a job I would have liked to have had, but the engineers did that.

The arterial road program, the rural roads program and the black spot program were excellent because they were able to target areas of greatest need. Keeping road funding separate under this legislation is very important because it highlights the great need for roadworks. Like the member for Lyne, I look at metropolitan councils and see that their roadworks involve just repairs and resealing, whereas in rural areas we are trying to do it from scratch.

The main local government body in my electorate is the city of Frankston.

It has five headings, which include `Australian Labor Party', `Liberal Party&mdash;Frankston Heights Branch', `Liberal Party&mdash;Seaford Branch', and `Young Liberals&mdash;Mount Eliza/Frankston'.

So you think that you are going to ring Mr August, but you do not because his private phone number is 9787 8095. But when you ring that particular number, it gets transferred to 783 1140.

That is where the jobs will be lost. They will be lost not out of all the executive staff, but from where the real workers are, at the coalface, where the people who work for the community are placed. They are all going to be sacked to make up this phoney amount that the Kennett government has set and that these governments have to save. Those people are going to be sacked any minute now.

Even though, compared with federal systems internationally, local government in Australia does not represent a large proportion of the public sector, the impact of its services is significant.

Investment in land and building development accounts for approximately 14 per cent of Australia's GDP. It is estimated that $1 billion in cost could be removed from the business sector if councils lifted their performance in development approvals to best practice standards. I know that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) is keen to see those best practice standards produced across the local government sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government discharges a growing set of responsibilities for quality of life programs. It is little understood in Australia's federal system of government how among the five community services from which young people derive their lifestyle opportunities&mdash;education, child care, recreation, cultural pursuits and libraries&mdash;all but education are provided by local government. In any practical assessment of social justice and equity issues in Australia, local government bulks large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quality of life in Australia depends substantially on the services and opportunities which the community provides from the combined resources of government. Inequality depends as much on where people live and their access to basic services as their access to satisfactory incomes. Less privileged areas are particularly affected by the lack of resources available to local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In affluent areas and regions, high personal incomes can secure access to a range of services otherwise provided by local government.

Private affluence replaces public necessity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conversely, the extent and quality of council services are much more important for the quality of life in low income areas. The federal government has an equity role to play in closing the gap between municipal responsibilities and municipal finances in disadvantaged local government areas. The traditional role of councils as providers of civic infrastructure and property related services is not as important to the creation of a more equal society as quality of life services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In disadvantaged areas, progress is more likely to come from quality libraries and learning and recreational and cultural development than roads, drainage and waste removal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 provides for federal untied financial assistance grants to be paid on an equal per capita basis to each state and territory. The aggregate amount of financial assistance grants and road funding comes to approximately $1 billion each year. Section 9 of the 1986 legislation sets out the basis of horizontal equalisation. The act also requires that no council receive less than it would have received if 30 per cent of the total funds in each state had been distributed on a per capita basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Horizontal equalisation in the main act means equalisation of the capacity to provide services, not equalisation of outcomes for the quality of life in each local government area. That is, grants are allocated to achieve, state by state, a certain standard of service with insufficient regard for social need and the demand for services. Only by gauging the capacity of areas to provide services from personal incomes and assets can governments target the benefits of public resources and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently, the funding formulas in each state give too much weight to equalising the standard of services and not enough to equalising their social impact in the community. As a result, grants are not necessarily targeted to areas of highest social need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This shortcoming was well exposed by data presented in the discussion paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financing local government</EMPHASIS> produced last year by the Australian Urban and Regional Development Review. The paper presents a correlation between the allocation of financial assistance grants and the ABS 1991 census index of relative socioeconomic disadvantage. The index scores each local government area in Australia according to a range of socioeconomic variables such as income, education levels, unemployment rates and home ownership. The data in table 1, which I will seek to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, reveals a series of inequitable outcomes. There is only a loose correlation between socioeconomic need and the scale of grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, for instance, the most disadvantaged 25 per cent of councils averaged grants of $47.77 per capita in 1991-92 while the second most advantaged quarter of councils received over $56 per capita. In Western Australia, the second quarter of councils received substantially lower per capita grants than the more affluent third quarter. In Tasmania, the second quarter received substantially higher grants than the more advantaged first quarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a regional level, even more inequitable outcomes are common. Table 2, which I will also seek to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, using eight councils on Sydney's urban fringe, shows how levels of social advantage and disadvantage are unrelated to the size and scale of financial assistance grants per capita. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These correlations and inequities can be linked to two inadequacies in the 1986 act. First, the methodologies adopted by the state local government grant commissions allow substantial variations from a national approach to needs based funding. I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister for seeking, through this legislation, to ensure that national principles based on equity and efficiency are incorporated in the allocation of financial assistance grants to local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The core methodology for revenue raising capacity in each state relies heavily on property valuations and rating bases. Standardised expenditures are determined mainly by cost differentials such as location, distance and the sparsity of population. Most significantly, no state includes in its funding formula a reliable measure of socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While for many years these statistics and indices were not available, the ABS and the Australian Taxation Office now have devised a series of worthwhile measures, excellent measures, suitable for national standards. There is no longer any reason why the funding formulas should not take prominent account of the social need for municipal services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles set out in the 1986 act, and formulas devised by the Local Government Grants Commission in the states and subsequently approved by federal ministers, ensure that any correlation between the distribution of grants and socioeconomic need has virtually been coincidental. The high priority given to revenue raising capacity has meant that only when revenue measures have coincided with community needs has a local government area received an equitable share of funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the western and south-western suburbs of Sydney, for instance, land values and rate revenue are artificially inflated by Sydney's expensive property market, yet disposable family incomes are relatively low. As a result, councils receive per capita federal grants based on distorted measures of revenue raising capacity rather than the capacity of the community to provide services for itself. Secondly, the equity of grant allocations is heavily distorted by the requirement for 30 per cent of funds to be distributed on a per capita basis. This guarantees each local authority in Australia access to federal grants. On a needs based assessment, however, not every local government area requires special assistance to service its community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the full logic of horizontal equalisation is followed to its most equitable outcome, levies should be placed on relatively well-endowed councils to help finance grants for the less well endowed. This policy has been used in some European nations to ensure the success of horizontal equalisation, irrespective of the provision of general revenue assistance from other levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, assuming the absence of intra-local government redistribution and adequate federal funding to achieve full equalisation to the highest standard, two models of equalisation are available to the federal government: full equalisation to a standard determined by available funds and partial equalisation to a higher standard. The 1986 legislation uses the latter approach, with the further restriction of the 30 per cent per capita threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By applying the conclusions of the 1985 Self report on disability measures, where 22 per cent of councils would not be eligible for funding under full equalisation, to the 1991 ABS census index of relative socioeconomic disadvantage, it is possible to approximate the funding in each state which is needlessly allocated to affluent local government areas. So $130.1 million of federal grants in the mainland states would otherwise be available for distribution to more disadvantaged local government areas. This represents 18.2 per cent of the federal allocation for 1993-94. The Self report in 1985 calculated this amount at 20 per cent, using a comprehensive model of disabilities. It can therefore be understood that the minister has a task ahead of him in determining national principles to ensure the most equitable allocation of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equalisation can be enhanced by abolishing the per capita component. As the Self report concluded at page 253 of its deliberations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if the same order of funds is made available as at present, 70 per cent of authorities would be entitled to equalisation grants and these grants would be sufficient to raise each of these authorities to within $0.5M of the average disability . . . without the per capita constraint, nearly 80 per cent of authorities would receive grants sufficient to raise them fully to the average disability.</PARA>
<PARA>I make the additional point that the re-allocation of local government funding in this fashion can proceed not only on the basis of social equity but also with an important employment consequence&mdash;that is, the councils which would receive the extra funding by and large are part of low employment, low growth regions. As Bob Gregory has pointed out in his research, this is largely a product of economic restructuring. The loss of relatively low skilled work in some of the manufacturing and government sectors has led to above average rates of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The restructuring of the economy has also meant that jobs in the non-traded sector are being predominantly provided in high growth, high consumption regions, with the outsourcing of household functions. This proposal for the redistribution of local government funding seeks to provide not only social equity and meet social need but also an outstanding employment consequence for the provision of relatively low skill, non-traded work in regions with low employment. It seeks to provide lower rates of unemployment. So I recommend that proposition in the formulation of the national principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the question of road funding, which is dealt with in this bill. State commissions have always included an assessment for roads as part of their determination of financial assistance grants. This role is now duplicated by identified road grants with formulas that vary substantially from state to state. Table 3, which I will seek to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, presents a summary of the state formulas. This highlights the absence of a national approach to local road funding. The weakness of these grants is the way in which they distort the principles of horizontal equalisation. Grants are allocated between the states  according to past patterns of expenditure instead of per capita funding. These imbalances are aggravated by inequities in the road funding formulas in some states. Again, I congratulate the minister for moving towards national principles&mdash;not only the FAGs, the financial assistance grants, but also the road funding allocations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, local road grants have become a substitute for other sources of local government revenue dedicated to roads. Most councils have a road allocation target or precedent in their annual budget which is set with little regard for the size of federal grants. As the Self report concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . road grants to local government are very close to general purpose assistance, especially since nothing is done to counter substitution effects at the local government level and ensure that the money actually leads to increased spending on roads . . . in the longer run it would be desirable to absorb the Commonwealth grant for local roads into the program of general purpose assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>The main argument presented against this recommendation is that it is not supported by a majority of councils. This is simply a case of the beneficiaries of inequity outweighing the lobbying capacity of the disadvantaged. Local road grants have become an addition to the overall financial capacity of councils without any link to social need or horizontal equalisation principles. Table 4 gives a guide to their impact in each state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current allocation of road grants provides a significant funding share for affluent local government areas. Table 5 shows that $61.4 million or 20.4 per cent of local road funding was granted to the 22 per cent most advantaged municipalities in the mainland states in 1993-94. These figures combined with the financial assistance grants mean that approximately $200 million or 19 per cent of federal funding for local government in Australia is allocated to councils which are socially measured and socially conceived as being least in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distribution of road grants in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia between urban and rural areas creates further inequities. In particular, no allowance is made for local government areas which are classified urban yet contain substantial rural road networks. Even the National Party would be interested in that phenomenon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Table 6 gives examples in New South Wales where councils in designated urban areas receive much lower per capita funding than rural councils with the same road length. Per capita figures are valid in this instance as they broadly reflect traffic volumes and the relative benefit of road funding shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vagaries of urban development and local government boundaries have meant that most urban fringe councils in Sydney&mdash;I represent one at Campbelltown in my electorate&mdash;the Hunter and Illawarra are based on urban areas surrounded by a network of townships and rural roads. The fixed distribution of urban and road funding shares has not been sensitive to this need. Rural roads in urban statistical areas receive no more than 30 per cent of the federal funding allocated to rural roads in rural statistical areas in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the shadow minister, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who is a member of the National Party, that there is a very important inequity here. If he wants to support rural roads, he should recognise the funding needs of what have been regarded in the statistical data as urban areas because of these anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strong arguments can be presented for the government to incorporate local road grants into the program of general purpose assistance. This would produce greater autonomy for local government in its expenditure decisions, simplify the grant scheme and resolve several aspects of inequitable funding. If separate local road grants remain, they should, after the expiry of the new agreement resolved at the recent Premiers Conference, be distributed on a per capita basis for each state, with a standard funding formula in all states and without artificial distinctions between urban and rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now refer to the findings of some recent reports on road funding. The National Transport Planning Taskforce in a report in November last year found that Australia would maximise its GDP by transferring a proportion of road funding from local to arterial roads and from rural to urban roads. This finding was supported by the work of Dr Vince FitzGerald, which was commissioned by the Australian Automobile Association, in 1993. Dr FitzGerald's finding stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the historical pattern of investment has led to relative over-investment in local and rural roads and under-investment in major urban roads. An economically optimal pattern of investment should result in returns from investment in each category of road being similar. Instead the results show higher returns from investment in urban roads than from investment in local and rural roads.</PARA>
<PARA>This should not be a surprise to the House. It is not surprising that GDP is maximised by a transfer from rural to urban road funding and from local to arterial road funding. This is the way in which the Australian economy has been transformed over the past decade. There has been a major shift in the origins of production from agriculture and mining&mdash;the areas on which Australia has historically relied&mdash;to manufacturing and service industries mainly based in urban areas. At the end of my speech, I will seek to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> table 7 and table 8.

In 1992-93 and again the following year approximately $350 million was allocated to local capital works in regions with rates of unemployment above the national average. These were by and large very successful schemes. The special federal grants helped councils clear a backlog of infrastructure projects which were outside the scope of their annual budgets. Councils estimated that the infrastructure constructed under the program had an average annual value to the community of $124 million. The valuation reports prepared by the minister's department also demonstrated the strong and very useful employment effects of those schemes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank those members who have contributed to the debate. As the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) said, this local government legislation is important. It opens up a very significant agenda for and debate on local government funding. Perhaps that debate is not quite as far reaching as the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) would like, but I think it provides the basis for a significant shift in local government funding over time to greater reflect the dual objectives of efficiency and equity that the member referred to. Those principles are extraordinarily important in any tier of government and they are sorted out by the balance of forces at a particular time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As numerous speakers referred to, the Commonwealth's relationship with local government not only involves a partnership, but also necessarily involves the states, which have significant legislative power in local government and which set their own local government reform objectives. We heard something of that from the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth). While he agrees with the objective, he has very considerable reservations about the means chosen to achieve that objective, particularly the power of the non-elected commissioners and the concerns about the use of state fiscal policy to impose targets in relation to local government savings that are achieved at a time when there are no elected councils in place. In your previous life, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, I do not think you would have felt comfortable with that kind of approach to reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking here about what the Commonwealth can do, and I think the Commonwealth can be clearer about its objectives. This legislation does not seek to tie funding for local government, but I do not think that is a serious argument anywhere. We are about to provide over a billion dollars&mdash;apart from the various tied grants or special grants that were mentioned&mdash;untied for a particular purpose, because we do recognise the importance of local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, much of what I have done while I have been responsible for local government is to say to local governments and local councils, `You really have been far too unambitious in what you have sought to achieve.' Local government in this country has somewhat meekly accepted the fact that its powers are much more limited than the powers that exist for local councils in other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, I spent time in the United States. I lived there for two years, and my family has lived there since for extended periods of time. What is striking about local government in the United States is the fact that it has considerably more power and influence than local government in this country. It is a very democratic level of government with very vigorous participation, but it is a level of government that has had entrusted to it a range of opportunities that simply have not been open to local government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A precondition for local government having greater opportunity in this country is that local government undergoes a process of reform. In part, that is achieved through a reduction in the number of councils. I do not remember the number that the member for Maranoa mentioned, but it sounded like a lot less than it would have been a year or two ago. It is true that several state governments have been involved in very significant reform. Tasmania, Victoria and Queensland have all sought to reduce the number of councils, and I certainly congratulate them for that. Local government does need to be in the form of larger units, but that is very much a matter for state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the federal government is concerned, we have provided very substantial funding for local government&mdash;something like twice the level of funding that is made available by state governments. So we are relatively more important than state governments. It is not unreasonable that we are clear in what we provide that money for. In this bill, we have tried to make clear what objectives we are seeking to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are moving to a concept of national principles, and we are doing that for reasons that would not be surprising to the member for Werriwa. What we have found, when we have looked at the bilateral arrangements or the principles worked out with the states, is the existence of extraordinary inequities or differences between states. So, rather than having an influence in the past with principles like equity and efficiency, we have seen a set of principles worked out by states and state grants commissions that have differed widely in terms of their impact. It is not unreasonable, over time, to work towards a much more nationally consistent approach to the way that funds are distributed&mdash;and I think that is accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that there has not been some process of consultation. Frankly, I suppose if there has been any time at which I felt slightly emotional, it was when I was accused of not consulting local government. From the beginning I have consulted local government extremely widely, speaking to all of the state conferences of local government associations at one time or another. I have spoken to many individual local councils and to shire associations. What is more, we have put out a far-reaching report on financing for local government; in fact, we have put out two reports&mdash;and both have been acknowledged, I think, by the member for Maranoa&mdash;providing the data on the basis of which judgments might be made about, broadly, the allocation and distribution of funds by local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the distribution of the papers in terms of the urban regional review, there have been a series of conferences involving ministers for local government, and the ALGAs have been involved in those meetings. I have vigorously defended the right of local government to be present at those meetings. I might say that, on the part of the states, there has not been the same enthusiasm for local government to be present and to be fully part of the discussion. The first set of national principles were agreed by the states and the ALGA at the April conference of local government ministers. So there has been agreement about the set of national principles that were drafted at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new bill provides that the minister, after consulting the state ministers, must formulate the principles in writing and convey them to state ministers. The new principles would then apply from the 1996-97 funding year onwards. As consultation and agreement have already taken place, the only further process is for me formally to agree with the principles in writing and notify the state ministers of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there has been a process, if you like, that has involved the ALGA and state ministers in a very thorough way&mdash;and I have sought to honour that. Consultation, as someone has remarked, does not mean agreement. It does not mean that at the end of the day I can take on board everything that has been suggested to me by the ALGA or its president. But I think, as the ALGA would concede or has conceded, we have been keen to consult closely with it. In the end we have tried to come up with something that it did not have any fundamental worries about. I think it has some niggles there. I think that is understandable in the sense that we are trying to move to a situation of much greater accountability and transparency, not just to the executive but to the parliament&mdash;and that is why we will introduce national reporting and make that report available to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will never have better information; we have never had better information than is available. If the Commonwealth government invests over $1 billion a year along with the other funds that it provides, I think it is entitled to get on the table a pretty fair view of how local government is performing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think people would recognise that is not an easy business. It is not just a matter of publishing&mdash;as I saw in the paper the other day&mdash;a leaked table, and making judgments about that leaked table, say, for New South Wales. It is a matter of looking carefully at the functions of local government and recognising the necessity for making judgments that will often compare very different situations. So no-one has to be sure about comparing like with like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the municipal association in Victoria has been very hard at work and, I must say, cooperatively has done some work in relation to benchmarking so that, ultimately, when we do put more emphasis on benchmarking, the work will have been done by local government and, therefore, will have acceptance from local government. It has been worked through in a very thorough way and progressively implemented, if you like, so that people have an opportunity to see what happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I think local government is going to welcome these reforms in practice. Perhaps the member for Maranoa would say the reforms are, essentially, a little too cautious. He would agree with the member for Werriwa on that, but I do not think the member for Maranoa would want to accept the reforms suggested, in a full-blooded way, by the member for Werriwa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are gentle about this, but we are gentle about it because we believe the facts will be persuasive. If we can get the facts on the table, the facts themselves will ultimately be very persuasive. I have never said, `We have to make threats or suggestions about removing untied grants.' We are supporting untied grants. We are enthusiastic about the autonomy of local government. That is why we supported the referendum in 1988. We wanted constitutional recognition but, unfortunately, the other side of the House, led by the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), did not. The member for Flinders worked himself up into a terrible lather and, I think, did local government in this country a very great disservice. Frankly, as you indicated yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think the issue of recognition of local government is a matter there is a great deal of support for in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by thanking the various members for their contributions and assuring them that their comments have been taken on board. We will go on with this process of reform over time at a pace local government can live with, and in a way that recognises the contribution of the states, with whom we need to cooperate if we are to achieve the kinds of comprehensive reforms the member for Werriwa no doubt would be pursuing as a backbencher and, ultimately, as a minister within future governments. </PARA>

<PARA>One of the most glaring omissions in this bill is the failure to require consultation with local government on the preparation of the national principles for the intrastate distribution of financial assistance grants. This is a breach of the understanding reached between local government, state ministers and the Australian Local Government Association at the recent local government ministers conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for the minister to consult with local government on the development of national distribution principles should be self-explanatory. Local government works closely with the states and the Commonwealth on discussions relating to the development, implementation and operation of these principles. It would be inconceivable that consultation on these issues not be reflected in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a rather strange omission in light of the government's express commitment to consultation, as evidenced in the minister's recent announcement of his intention to develop an accord with local government. The amendment requiring the minister to consult with state ministers and local government before varying or revoking the principles similarly needs little explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill's silence on the need for consultation in the event of variation or revocation of the principles may have been a drafting oversight; nevertheless, it is one that needs to be corrected. There is also no reason why the bill should not require the minister to provide copies of the national principles to local government, as key players in the administration of local government funding arrangements. I commend the amendments to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>This bill provides the federal minister with enormous personal discretion over intrastate distribution of federal local government financial assistance grants. In the case of local road funding, the minister's discretion is that the interstate distribution of these funds is completely unfettered. The only limitation on the minister's power in respect of the distribution of general purpose grants is the requirement that the funds be allocated on a horizontal, equalisation basis together with a minimum per capita requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the current draft of the national principles are similar to arrangements already in place and, as I mentioned earlier, have relatively little impact on the current intrastate funding distribution, the scope does exist in the legislation for the promulgation of principles which substantially alter this distribution. For example, depending on the criteria used, the result might be a shift in the rural urban split of funding or the allocation of funds on a regional basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real potential that at some indeterminate time in the future the great big whiteboard will be dusted off and brought back into active service. In the past, an unrestricted power to determine principles has provided a federal minister with a role in the disbursement to specific councils of special reserve local road funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all these reasons, the opposition considers it appropriate that the principles be a disallowable instrument subject to the full scrutiny of parliament. The government agreed to this arrangement at the local government ministers meeting in October 1994 but has failed to ensure it is incorporated in the bill. The minutes of this meeting clearly reflect this and the other agreements I have referred to today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention of the fourth amendment circulated in my name accords the national principles the status of a disallowable instrument for the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act. This provides either house of parliament with an opportunity to examine the principles and, if it has concerns about their content, to pass a motion disallowing them. The notice of motion to disallow must be given within 15 sitting days after the principles have been laid before the House. This process promotes transparency in the allocation process and retains some parliamentary oversight of the distribution of $1.1 billion of Commonwealth assistance provided annually. I commend the amendment to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the view expressed by Professor George Winterton, a member of the Republic Advisory Committee, that if the Governor-General's powers are inherited by a republican head of state, since the link with the monarchy would have been severed, the present conventions governing the exercise of the reserve powers might not subsist? What is the basis of the Prime Minister's apparently confident belief that the conventions governing the reserve powers can safely travel from a Governor-General to a president, even though they are not conventions of government but conventions of the Crown?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government would&mdash;and the parliament would by proposal, then by referendum&mdash;make it clear in a referendum proposal that those powers, the so-called reserve powers, now enjoyed by the Governor-General would be enjoyed by the incumbent president; in which case, the powers would be undefined. The alternative is to try to define the powers to say what such a person may or may not do. I think the honourable gentleman opposite would agree that the difficulty in that is that all of the contingencies which go to the rights and prerogatives of the head of state versus the head of government versus the government&mdash;questions about the rights of the Prime Minister and the cabinet in the event, say, of a 1975 type deadlock&mdash;would then have to be comprehended in a set of codified arrangements. I think they are not capable of being, first, agreed to and, second, foreseen. What is implied in the question is that, if it is not written down, the power does not exist.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UU5">Mr HORNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the importance of returning the budget to surplus? What would be the consequences of failing to achieve that outcome?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1575" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the member for Paterson, I can say that it is very important to return the budget to surplus, as the government has announced it will do in 1995-96 through various measures, including significant fiscal tightening, to achieve a surplus of $718 million in 1995-56 and going out to $7.4 billion by 1998-99. That is important to take the pressure off interest rates. It will dramatically reduce the bond selling task by some $15 billion in 1995-96. The tightening of fiscal policy is anti-inflationary, and so it helps us to keep inflation low. Also, the restoration of budget surpluses means a major reduction in public sector dissaving, so a boost to national saving, less reliance on the savings of foreigners and a better balance of payments current account outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this represents a classic countercyclical policy as well as an attempt to structurally improve our national savings. The importance of such policy has been recognised even by the Leader of the Opposition in his otherwise extraordinarily unnotable headland speech on Tuesday night, otherwise known as his Cape Barren speech&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Tim Fischer" NAMEID="DG4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Cape of Good Hope!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;His Cape Barren speech because it has absolutely nothing in it. He did manage to make this commitment though:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Greater economic flexibility will reduce but not remove the need for counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, he said that they can see that there would be a need for countercyclical macro-economic policies, which is what the government is engaged in in this budget, for the reasons I have just mentioned. Subsequently, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To preserve policy flexibility and prudent public debt levels, the corollary is that the governments will need to run budget surpluses in the upswing to increase public saving, which is vital to curing Australia's current account deficit problem.</PARA>
<PARA>So he is committing himself to saying that we should have budget surpluses in the upswing to increase public saving, which is vital to addressing the current account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the rhetoric, but there is an enormous gap between the windy rhetoric of the headland speech and the reality of opposition behaviour. As everyone in this House knows, in this budget debate the opposition is trying to prevent billions of dollars of deficit reduction from going through. It is doing this by opposing various tax measures in relation to company tax, the Medicare levy, building materials, cars, the PAYE remittance and the provisional tax uplift factor. The combined effect in 1995-96 would be to deprive the government of some $1.5 billion of tax revenue, and in the following year $2.6 billion; and to change the budget outcome for this year from a surplus of $718 million to a deficit of $827 million, and next year from a surplus of $3.4 billion to a much smaller surplus of $816 million&mdash;in other words, a surplus which would be a surplus only because of assets sales and not what the government was trying to achieve in 1996-97: a surplus without asset sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we see on the one hand this commitment in the broad, this rhetoric about support for responsible countercyclical policy and budget surpluses, and on the other hand an absolute attempt to prevent that happening. This is nothing more than economic sabotage by an opposition which on the one hand is trying to stand on the lofty heights and say, `We support appropriate policy. We stand for appropriate policy and policy which is in the interests of the nation,' but, when it comes to the reality of measures before this House, it votes time and time again to try to stop that outcome occurring. In other words, it is just a complete attempt to sabotage the economy, to make it more difficult in terms of the current account, to make it more difficult in terms of anti-inflationary behaviour and to keep pressure on interest rates. From the opposition's behaviour, quite clearly it would like to see those things happen. That is an atrocious position for the opposition to be in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Leader of the Opposition wants to stomp around the country pretending to be a man of some honour, a man who stands for something substantial and a real alternative, then surely it is up to him to behave like that and not just to make expressions of high-sounding rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to the reality, we see an opposition which is simply unprepared to do that. If it wants to argue that it should be done through outlays, let me say this very briefly about outlays:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">outlays for 1995-96 are 25.1 per cent of GDP, 3 1/2 per cent of GDP below what they were when we came into office, 3 1/2 per cent of GDP less than they were when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. Outlays as a percentage of GDP in 1995-96 are lower that in any year when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. Outlays are projected to drop to 24 per cent of GDP by 1998-99, from their current 25.1 per cent for 1995-96, which is almost two per cent of GDP less than in any year when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Outlays are not extravagant. They are tight, but they are very well targeted to those in need. If the opposition wants to say that we should be slashing outlays rather than raising taxes, that means it has to face up to the fact that it would be taking amounts away from people in need&mdash;the very people it says it is concerned about. Let me conclude on this point about battlers. The Leader of the Opposition in his speech on Tuesday night revealed all by this sentence. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I might add that Menzies would have smiled to himself, as I did, when, after a week of us fighting for the interests of the Australian battler . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A week. That is about how long it lasts. When a poll driven analysis says, `Fight for the battler. There might be something in that,' the opposition does it for a week. It stands up and says, `We're here to defend the battler.' But that was not the reality when the opposition was in government; it is not the reality in anything that has been said by the opposition to this point in time. What is clear is that it is this government which stands for the people in need, and the defence of outlays demonstrates that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a supplementary question to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that my first question was not directed to whether or not the reserve powers should be explicitly spelt out in a republican constitution, but whether it was possible to transfer, from our present constitution to a republican constitution, reserve powers of the Crown and conventions of the Crown as distinct from the conventions of government. I remind the Prime Minister that Professor George Winterton, in the article to which I referred in my first question, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So a republican constitution cannot simply continue the present constitutional position of conferring powers on the head of state in general terms relying on the constitutional conventions to govern their exercise.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are matters which the Australian public is entitled to think about. It is part of what I call the debate which has ensued from last night's statement. That is why I welcome the Leader of the Opposition's questions, but I do want him to say where he stands on that core point. Does he believe an Australian should be our head of state? That is the central point. No amount of obfuscation, indecision or talking about people's or constitutional conventions&mdash;a sort of black hole that has in it the external affairs power, the power of the Senate and all these other questions&mdash;will obviate the need for him to say where he stands on the central issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth recording again that one of his fellows, the Premier of Victoria, had a few things to say about these matters. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think last night's speech&mdash;while it won't be agreed to by all&mdash;sets a blueprint for discussion. You've got to understand, a great number of this community are young people who do not have the same historical reference point back to the UK. We have a large number of ethnic community members who have come from republics&mdash;or in fact other sorts of societies&mdash;and I think there is a growing recognition that this issue is going to be resolved. Now, that will be done through a referendum, and the public&mdash;each and every one of us&mdash;will be able to make our own decision.</PARA>
<PARA>He is dead right. A journalist also asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why do you think Mr Howard is supporting a people's convention?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And Jeff Kennett went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that is only going to be able to really express their personal views. They may argue they represent a greater number of people, but finally this is going to be decided by each and every one of us. A convention to me is just another committee.  . . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's not much point calling out 400 people out of a community of 18 million, sitting them down and saying: now, what do you think about it?</PARA>
<PARA>That was precisely the burden of my remarks last night. The greatest act of expressive democracy here is the referendum. A proposal for a constitutional change must come through this chamber. It cannot be conferred upon any sort of constitutional committee or convention. It must come here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When pressed about this in the past and asked, `Would you accept the results of a so-called convention and put it absolutely to a referendum?' the coalition has said, `No, we reserve the right to make our own decision about that.' In other words, they are consigning a convention to basically a talk shop. As Jeff Kennett said&mdash;and I might say he said it very eloquently&mdash;`There's not much point calling out 400 people out of a community of 18 million and calling them the people.' That is as clear an answer that is going to be given to this smokescreen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one question to be answered here&mdash;that is, whether an Australian person should be the head of state. No smothering with the blanket of a convention by the Leader of the Opposition will disguise that question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Can the minister inform the House of the data released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics about the Australian labour force? What implications does that data have for the government's Working Nation initiatives?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1578" SPEAKER="Crean The Hon S.F." NAMEID="DT4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HOTHAM" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Today's labour force survey figures confirm in trend terms the continued improvement in the Australian labour market. In trend terms the unemployment rate fell to 8.4 per cent, the lowest since December 1990, and the trend unemployment rate has fallen every month since August 1993. In other words, for almost two years the trend rate has been coming down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In seasonally adjusted terms, the figures show today that employment fell by 21,400 and that unemployment rose to 8.5 per cent. But the fall in employment this month represents a modest correction from the extraordinary jump of more than 90,000 in April and, I might say, is at the lower end of market expectations. I might also observe for those who are chortling on the other side that this correction this month is consistent with the recent pattern whereby we have seen very large increases in employment in one month followed by very small corrections in the following month. That is why the trend as well as the actual figures have continued to come down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last two months there has been a net increase in total employment of 69,000 jobs&mdash;all of them full-time jobs. I might also observe that the figures today indicate that female full-time employment rose by a further 8,800 and is now at an all-time high. The participation rate remained at the very high 63.7 per cent, which I might observe is a healthy sign of a strong labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these figures are consistent with our achieving the Working Nation targets. It is true that the jobs growth has been slowing but it has been off huge growth that no-one ever expected could be achieved. But what is also consistent when these figures come out is the pattern of opposition response. Last month, when there was the huge employment growth, those opposite were out there predicting interest rate rises. This month, when we have had a fall that is observed by the markets to be a correction, they are telling us that the rate of employment growth is slowing and we are back into recession. The problem for that side is that it wants to carp and criticise but it does not want to offer constructive solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where was the reference in the headland speech to employment and training? There was not one. Even in The Things That Matter we had a whole chapter devoted to it, but it has dropped off the agenda over there&mdash;probably because the shadow minister is incapable of putting the policies together. Those opposite have no policies on employment and unemployment. They have no commitment to the youth training initiative or Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is despite the fact that we have members of the National Party putting on record in the parliament their support for Working Nation initiatives. The member for Lyne is a very perceptive member because he is getting behind these initiatives. Members of the National Party want them supported, but where is their mention on your side? There is none at all. You have no commitment to the training wage. Your approach is to cut youth wages. It is to force young people off the dole. For those who have not been able to get off the benefit, you will wash your hands of them and refer them to the voluntary organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact of the matter remains: we have created 610,000 jobs in the last two years and since 1983 we have increased the total number of jobs in the economy by two million. When the current Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of the coalition government, he could manage only 262,000 jobs in 5 1/2 years. Get the comparison. Do you understand the difference between our approach to job creation and yours? Our approach produced 610,000 jobs in two years and two million in 12 years and your miserable performance produced 262,000 jobs in a whole 5 1/2 years. Well done! Little wonder you cannot put a policy together now. I might say that I am told today&mdash;</PARA>

It went like this: he asked the person, `What were the figures?' Obviously, he was referring to the unemployment figures. The response was, `They're up.' The member for Mayo said, `That's good,' but when he was seen saying that it was good he said, `No, I mean it's bad.' We all know how he can change his mind, but the simple fact remains that when it comes to employment the opposition has no policies. All it has is hope that the figures will go bad for us. Well, they are not going bad for us and they will continue to improve.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia is one of the few countries that can claim to have a very innovative public broadcasting sector, through the ABC and SBS, as well as a very dynamic commercial television sector. All of them are very strongly committed to producing good Australian content. Yesterday, the Australian Broadcasting Authority released its new standard for Australian content on commercial television. The new rules will strengthen the Australian presence on our television screens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new standard of the ABA is the result of intensive consultations with broadcasters, program makers and members of the public. With commercial television being the most influential sector of broadcasting in Australia, this is a very pivotal debate. It will help by increasing the level of Australian content on television, it will make sure that we are continuing to develop and protect Australia's identity as seen on television and, in particular, it will make sure that the shape of kids' dreams are influenced in the right manner on television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new standard provides for an increase in the minimum annual level of Australian content to 55 per cent. This is to be achieved by the commercial broadcasters by 1998. Most importantly of all there will be a doubling in the level of new Australian children's drama by 1998. Australia already has a tremendous reputation throughout the world for producing quality children's drama on television. We have series such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Winners</EMPHASIS>, which has been seen in 82 countries around the world; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Round the Twist</EMPHASIS>, which has been seen in 45 countries around the world; and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lift Off</EMPHASIS>, which has been picked up by the Fox network in the United States as well as in many other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week when I was in Seoul for a meeting of APEC communications ministers, one of the US federal communications commissioners went out of her way to praise Australia for the fact that we are leading the world in producing quality children's drama on television. That is something which all of us can be very proud of. The new standard proposed by the ABA also provides for a simplified Australian content test. That will provide some assistance to broadcasters in calculating their obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we will see is that the viewers will benefit from more Australian content and, in particular, kids will benefit from more quality Australian children's drama on television. We will see the program makers benefit from an increase in their production slates. We will also see benefits for the broadcasters with the introduction of simplified system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This commitment to improving the level of Australian content on television goes side by side with the government's assistance to the film and television industry. The government has given assistance to the Australian Film Commission, Film Australia and the Film, Television and Radio School. We also made a commitment in Creative Nation to provide $60 million to initiate a television production fund to enhance the quality of Australian programming independently of these local content obligations. In Creative Nation we also made commitments towards new multimedia&mdash;$45 million for the Australian Multimedia Enterprise and a commissioning of 10 CD ROM for the Australia on CD program. This demonstrates quite clearly that across the board the government is making a very firm commitment to our creative industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the opposition leader, in his headland speech last Tuesday, made some comments on the communications and the arts portfolio. Those comments were made under the headline `The communications revolution'. While the government has produced Creative Nation, the communications future project reports and the BSEG report, Networking Australia's future&mdash;which in total would make up documents this thick&mdash;the opposition's contribution is not documents that thick. It is not a series of proposals to help creative Australians. It is 12 paragraphs from the Leader of the Opposition. Is it any wonder we call the Leader of the Opposition's speech `Point Missing'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we call it `Point Missing' is that, in those 12 paragraphs, the only comment the Leader of the Opposition could offer our creative industries and the only offer of assistance he could put forward for our film and television makers and our artists is that he believes the communications revolution will be part of the Howard-Costello industrial relations laboratory. All of those film makers, screen writers, performing artists and visual artists are going to be inputs to the opposition's industrial relations laboratory. If that is not the case, why could the opposition not say anything else about our cultural industries other than, `It gets down to industrial relations'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably no surprise given that the opposition spokesman on communications has said, `Government assistance to the creative industries is a waste of money. It is money down the drain.' The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said that for the government to have a policy on the arts is a joke. It is no wonder that we can see there is no difference between the views advocated by the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the opposition's spokesman on communications. The opposition has no commitment to Australia's cultural industries and no understanding of the tremendous possibilities that these industries can deliver Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After the French revolution came and the great revolution in the United States came with the American war of independence&mdash;where that fight was led by the first American President, the great soldier statesman, George Washington&mdash;the designers of the American constitution sat down to write their constitution. When they did that, they severely constrained the powers of the American presidency and divided it between the presidency, the legislature and the supreme court. That is, despite the huge political force running right through that century and down to the last quarter of it and winning a war of independence, there was still substantial constraints on American executive presidential authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No such similar constraints existed in the transfer of powers from the English monarchs to the British Prime Minister and, after 1901, to the Australian Prime Minister and cabinet.

But of course Malcolm Fraser lost the legitimacy he was always looking for, and it was permanently denied to him as a consequence. That same legitimacy was also denied to Sir John Kerr.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that has been a very salutary exercise in what I described last night as one of the checks on a head of state&mdash;that is, with someone who determines upon a course of action he or she knows to be controversial, they need to understand that the action is both warranted and capable of being defended. If it is not warranted and capable of being defended, then they will have to wear the opprobrium of public opinion&mdash;that is, beyond the other checks which are that either house, by simple majority, can command a joint sitting to either seek to remove or censure the head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in the model the government is putting forward, there is no link in the question between the existence of the reserve powers and Sir John Kerr's use of them which makes anybody who argued against Sir John Kerr's use argue that the powers are illegitimate. No-one has ever argued that. Gough Whitlam was not arguing that yesterday&mdash;he was not even arguing that yesterday. He understands, I think, the power which has been conferred upon Prime Ministers and cabinets in the Westminster system, and he understands the reserve power which existed in the hands of the monarch and, in this case, her deputy that in no way illegitimised those powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What made it illegitimate was the fact that the power was abused; it was abused by a Governor-General who refused to tell his Prime Minister what he had in mind. As you know, I was with Gough Whitlam on the last occasion he saw Sir John Kerr&mdash;the very last occasion that afternoon. Let me assure you, there was no attempt by him whatsoever to tell the then Prime Minister what he had in mind. So he swore in Malcolm Fraser. Malcolm Fraser then had to wear a lack of confidence, a no confidence, motion in the House of Representatives. Then the Governor-General refused to see the Speaker of the House of Representatives. When the head of state got down to refusing to see the Speaker of the House of Representatives, you knew, basically, in moral terms, that the game was up for him&mdash;and it has been up for him ever since.</PARA>

Let us look at the women's organisations in relation to equal pay for equal work, child care, the maternity allowance, the current Commonwealth focus on and policy attention to violence in the community and the protection of women against violence. These are issues which have arisen because of views put by women's organisations around this country. Are they a rabid interest group with unreasonable access to the government, a group representing half the population? Shocking!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have the ACTU. This is the group most of the Leader of the Opposition's bile has been reserved for, not only now but over the years. Have we not all benefited from the industrial peace, the wage restraint, the job growth and the industrial relations reforms that have occurred over those 12 years? Before the accord, under the Fraser-Howard government, working days lost per thousand workers from industrial disputes averaged 590. Since the accord, this number has fallen by 70 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training made a point earlier about the huge multiples of employment growth which have come from these policies compared with coalition times. Meeting and speaking with the government and joining the government productively over 12 years to have a better industrial relations scene, higher levels of productivity, lower levels of inflation and higher levels of employment growth are seen by the opposition leader to be unseemly, an undue right from another so-called rabid interest group. There is also the fact that we have inflation of between two per cent and three per cent when it was at over 10 per cent under him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the Australian Council of Social Services, the Salvation Army, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and St Vincent de Paul&mdash;all these welfare agencies that have shown interest in the plight of people in desperate positions, either homeless or in need of family support. All of the ones I mentioned came out explicitly supporting the job compact to get long-term unemployed people back to work. The job compact was described by the OECD a week ago as an innovative, equitable and economically efficient labour market reform. What a gall! Are they the rabid interest groups the Leader of the Opposition is referring to? Are they not entitled to put a view about their constituency as they see it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the National Farmers Federation? What a shocking hide it had to come to the government and talk about income support for people in drought affected areas. The government went out and listened to them, understood the problem and removed the farm assets test for the support of income which has now gone to 10,000 farm families. What about the rural adjustment scheme which is going to help farms aggregate and allow some people to get off their properties or get more economic units, or what about drought proofing farms in the future by measures which will support water and fodder storage? Are these rabid interest groups?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only someone who has such an elitist view of the world who wants to govern by press release, which was the way it was in the 1970s, the way it was under the Fraser-Howard regime, where neither business nor labour were consulted, where the welfare agencies and the voluntary agencies were regarded as so irrelevant that they went on to behave in this way. When you see the Leader of the Opposition come out with this speech&mdash;this collection of junk, this collation of rubbish&mdash;and try to put it across as policy and then attack people as rabid interest groups for having the temerity to participate in our representative democracy, I say the Leader of the Opposition is a long way off the mark of the thought processes of this community and what it requires from a representative parliamentary system.</PARA>

Apparently they are arguing over there that if the coalition had had two-thirds of a majority in both houses in 1975 it would have been dreadful for them to nominate and elect a head of state.

The Commonwealth's total annual increase for 1996 under the ANTA agreement is $380 million and it raises the Commonwealth's share of total recurrent funding for vocational education and training from seven per cent in 1991 to an estimated 27 per cent in 1996.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I will endeavour to answer the questions as best I can, but some things need to be put on the record. The first thing that ought to be said is that the Premier of South Australia and indeed the Liberal and National parties in this parliament would never dare to treat the spiritual beliefs of non-indigenous Australians the way that they are treating the spiritual beliefs of Aboriginal people. I think it needs to be understood what a horrendous consequence it is for Australian values for a premier of a state to commission a royal commission, with all the draconian powers that that implies, into the spiritual beliefs of a number of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pose the question to other religious faiths and beliefs in this country: how would they feel if a state premier were to commission a royal commission into their spiritual beliefs? This is a very serious matter, and it goes far beyond issues involving my portfolio. I am sure that a number of people in the government will be saying some things about this in weeks to come. What we are seeing here is a wave of politically inspired royal commissions emanating from the Indian Ocean and sweeping eastward across the country, so I suppose we should not be surprised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very serious matter, and in the course of my remarks I will not comment more about that royal commission except to say this: the royal commission, I think, poses great threats to the proper management and administration of government in South Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. Few members of this parliament have a greater commitment to the environment, both globally and locally, than the member for Dunkley, and he has considerable respect for his efforts. I thank the member for his question because it enables me to mention <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Green cities</EMPHASIS>, a report of the Australian Urban and Regional Development Review, which opens up a range of issues concerning the environment and makes a number of policy proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an important report, and a report that all members of the parliament would benefit from by reading. It is one that the government takes seriously. Already, in terms of both greenhouse and coastal management, the government has taken significant initiatives to pursue issues that touch on the environment of cities. For most people, the environmental issues that are of greatest importance are those that are closest to them such as air, water, the quality of the local environment and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also the honourable member for Dunkley draws attention to the methodical way the government goes about developing policy, exposing that policy and encouraging debate within the community. Over time that has meant that the government has been able to produce the kinds of significant reforms that the Prime Minister referred to earlier. It also gives us the opportunity to draw attention to the opposition's absence of statements of policy&mdash;not necessarily statements of policy in books but statements that clearly set out opposition policy on the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leaves a vacuum that is picked up by members of the opposition, who exploit that vacuum by putting forward in the name of the opposition ideas that no-one in this parliament would take seriously. I refer to the honourable member for Warringah. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> only a few days ago, he put forward, presumably on behalf of the opposition, quite substantial thoughts. He contemplates the sale of Telecom and says that we could start to use the proceeds to create an environmental army, and that environmental army could be led by a corps commander of high profile. He suggests that he could be the former Governor of New South Wales&mdash;I guess that appeals to him, as a monarchist&mdash;or Dick Smith, or more or less anyone. He then says that we could use the resources from the sale of Telecom to develop a project that would be environmentally relevant. He develops the idea:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We don't know how many environmental projects can be completed with relatively unskilled labour&mdash;but chronic problems such as lack of tree cover, weed infestation and feral animals could be solved by enough people with shovels, mattocks, seeds, fencing material, traps and hessian bags.</PARA>
<PARA>So the honourable member for Warringah steps into this policy vacuum, dreams up an idea worth some billion dollars and suggests that we get a corps commander to organise it and, basically, has the unemployed all around Australia chasing cats down drains in the name of some kind of commitment to the environment.</PARA>

Given that this is a matter that has been forward three times this week for consideration as an MPI, I have had a look at some of the issues contained here. It is a very difficult thing to rule on in the parliament. A lot of information about the issue is out there in the general public. The minister has indicated in question time today that there is an inquiry that he has established. I understand again that there is an inquiry that the South Australian government is intending to put in place or has put in place. To that extent, it is very difficult for me, therefore, to say what is or is not sub judice under those various inquiries. I just say to members that if they want to end their contributions&mdash;provided, of course, they are mindful of that&mdash;then they should be careful in what they say so that perhaps some new information which could possibly prejudice the court case is not introduced in this place. But, as I said, there is so much that has been written on this out there that I suspect this debate can continue in the way it has.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CU4">Mrs GALLUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. In the Saunders report, which the minister considered, Professor Saunders raised the fact that she did not have an independent anthropologist present. She said that she had limited time and that she had spoken briefly to only two women and had got information from only one woman. The minister was aware of that, but he did not read the 400 representations that were sent to him. We have probably established that he did not have the time to do that. We have gone through the time line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice O'Loughlin found that the minister did not consider those representations. The minister keeps referring to the judgment of Justice O'Loughlin and saying that he was vindicated. Justice O'Loughlin said that the minister did not give any consideration to representations at all. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consequence of these findings is the conclusion that there has been a fundamental failure by the Minister to comply with the statutory obligation that he consider the representations before deciding whether to exercise his power . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is clear, yet this minister keeps saying that Justice O'Loughlin has vindicated him. So he did not look at the representations; he did not consider them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice O'Loughlin then overturned your declaration, and that seems to be something we have forgotten. This is not the first time, is it? The minister at the table has had three declarations overturned. This is not the first time a declaration was overturned. The second time the minister failed to make a declaration because the Premier of Western Australia did not want him to a make a declaration in favour of Aboriginal people. But the law overturned that; the Federal Court said that he had to. We still have the Broome crocodile farm case under review, in which the minister's declaration was again overturned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is a minister who has had three declarations overturned. What does that say about the minister's competence in administering the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Act? We have Justice O'Loughlin saying in the Hindmarsh Island case that the minister did not read the representations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Post Justice O'Loughlin's decision, amounts of information have come up via the media which this minister has chosen to ignore. At any time he had the option to say, `Enough is enough; it is time that we stopped the harm to Aboriginal heritage and Aboriginal people and that we got this out of the press and into a judicial inquiry.' But did the minister do that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Laura Kartinyeri is supposedly the oldest Ngarrindjeri woman and the person responsible for the secrets, but the minister never sought her evidence. When a letter came claiming that Nanna Kartinyeri did not know anything of the secret women's business it was ignored. It was later claimed that this letter was not written by the person claimed to have written it but that it was a hoax written by somebody else&mdash;in fact, Allan Campbell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did the minister do anything at that stage to settle this question? He did nothing. He left it open. Did Nanna Kartinyeri write that letter or did Allan Campbell forge it? We do not know. The fact that these questions remain unanswered casts a big question over the whole Aboriginal heritage issue and puts Aboriginal people against Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three Ngarrindjeri women went on television. The first was the spokesperson, Dorothy Wilson. Dorothy Wilson says that she was at the meeting where a white lawyer put forward the women's business and she said that it was fabricated at that time. What a blow this is to Aboriginal heritage that somebody would say this. Is Dorothy Wilson telling the truth? I do not know, but neither does the minister. If she is not telling the truth, then she should be stopped from saying these things because they are harming Ngarrindjeri women. If she is telling the truth, then her accusations have to be investigated because they cast aspersions on the whole issue of Aboriginal heritage around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the minister do? Absolutely nothing. He has not investigated these accusations. He has washed his hands of them like Pontius Pilate and has said, `It has nothing to do with me. Let the Ngarrindjeri women tear themselves to pieces.' That is all this minister does. He has allowed these women to be branded as outcasts and liars. The minister has said nothing to defend these women who have came forward. He has not listened to them and he has allowed them to go unheard through the official channels. That is how much respect this minister has for Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue has been in the papers for over a year. The minister firstly ignored the women, we then had questions about the anthropologic evidence and now we have a public fight about whether the anthropologist who appeared for the Aboriginal legal movement in South Australia was qualified enough to give evidence. What was her role?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leading South Australia anthropologist, the head of the South Australian Museum of Anthropology, Phillip Jones, then said that the whole thing was not true and that, from his experience, it did not exist. He debunked the whole issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage I would have thought the minister would have said, if nothing else, `Enough is enough. Aboriginal heritage has suffered enough. As the minister, I have a responsibility to look after Aboriginal heritage and to make sure that these accusations do not go on time after time.' This minister ignored that. He has made no reference to that and the accusations have circulated around Australia. </PARA>

Indeed, the track record shows that, in relation to the Broome crocodile farm, I attempted to achieve a mediation, but it was not possible because of the Western Australian government's intransigence on this issue. In the case of the protection of the Todd River and, at issue, a declaration there to prevent the construction of a dam, I attempted to try to secure agreement between the Northern Territory government and the Aboriginal people. That came to a rather bitter end with the now legendary Max Ortmann in the bed of the Todd River. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say these things because my administration of the act is under criticism in the motion&mdash;this very political motion, which is lacking in substance but has been moved by the opposition. So it is important, I think, that I make some threshold remarks about the general administration of the act. I also say, as I have said many times before, that the federal legislation is legislation that is only effectively used as a last resort&mdash;that is, when state or territory legislation is inadequate or is inadequately applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the question of the Hindmarsh Island bridge and the application that was made to me for heritage protection. In this case, as with all other cases, I chose someone to commission a report who was totally at arm's length from me. Professor Cheryl Saunders is an eminent Australian academic. She has, regrettably, been subject to, I think, very unfair and very damaging criticism by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and by other members in this House&mdash;the member for Deakin (Mr Aldred). As the Federal Court said in its judgment in relation to the Hindmarsh Island case, she is a person of very great integrity, and the government rejects absolutely the slurs that have been made on her. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is why I think it is fundamentally important that, if the media are to write about the issue, they read the judgment of Justice O'Loughlin. While that judgment ultimately came against me on limited procedural points, the arguments trotted out by the coalition were argued in detail in the Federal Court. It was said, for example, that the fact that I issued a declaration for 25 years, contrary to the initial advice from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, was somehow an abuse of process. That was rejected by the court. Justice O'Loughlin said that the decision was for me to make&mdash;and I followed the report of Professor Saunders on that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

They will see that all of these issues were raised in direct detail before the Federal Court. I have been subject to the most extraordinary judicial consideration in respect of this matter. The very layout of the kitchen at my house was the subject of evidence given before the court. The end result of all this was that His Honour did not uphold the assertions that were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was suggested that because the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission had given some advice to the applicants about matters within their responsibility this showed somehow that I was biased or showed some impropriety on behalf of ATSIC. This was expressly rejected by the Federal Court of Australia. It was said by the coalition and by a number of other people in the media and was written up, in the case of Mr Easdown, almost exclusively without any attempt to contact my office. There were page 2 stories in major selling tabloids damning me without even the courtesy of a phone call. In my public life, I have an obligation to uphold certain standards, as do members of the House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was said that I had in some way, in a number of things, prejudged this matter because I had had a draft declaration prepared&mdash;again, a matter expressly considered by Justice O'Loughlin in the Federal Court. His Honour in fact found that that was a prudent course of action to adopt. It was said that, because I took action on behalf of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth of Australia to investigate whether the Commonwealth would incur any liability, somehow or other that was an impropriety. Again, Justice O'Loughlin said that that was a proper course of action for a minister to take in the interests of taxpayers, and so it goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I regret most of all is not the damage the coalition campaign has done to me. I have never had in all my years in public life&mdash;and there are many of them now&mdash;such warmth and such a show of support, not only from my colleagues in the Australian Labor Party but also from people I care about in the Australian community, including the leadership of churches and the leadership of community groups of great repute throughout, indeed, Adelaide and South Australia, and not only people in the trade union movement but also fair-minded Australians who respect the way in which this matter has been conducted. I take this opportunity to thank each and every one of those many people who have expressed that great support to me in the course of the last couple of weeks as this campaign by the coalition was mounted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right to today, and indeed yesterday, I have dealt with this matter with the utmost propriety. I say categorically that the decision to commission a further inquiry under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act by Her Honour Justice Jane Mathews, President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Deputy President of the National Native Title Tribunal, was taken before any suggestion of any inquiry, or decision on the part of the South Australian government to conduct an inquiry. The decision was mine. I took the initiative and the reason I took that initiative, to be very blunt&mdash;this is the saddest part of all of this issue&mdash;was that I became convinced that the coalition would continually seek to use and fuel great division on this issue, that it would continue to inflict great damage on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, that it would continue, as a calculated campaign, to try and discredit Aboriginal people and the heritage process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my remarks thus far, I have responded in a very considered way in respect of a number of process matters that have been raised in the course of debate. I say in respect of the politics of this that no-one ought to be under any misapprehension as to what is driving this process. What we are seeing here is the Adelaide establishment using every trick in the book, including a royal commission into the spiritual beliefs of Aboriginal people in South Australia, to strike back at people who at least in some way contributed to the political demise of the member for Barker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this is all about. This is the absolute core of the issue. We know why the member for Mayo is playing such an active role in this process&mdash;he, too, is another wounded soldier of the Adelaide establishment, another fallen soldier whose own transgressions in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs policy were the very reason why he lost the high office that he once held. This has been from day one a political campaign of the coalition in which the Liberal Party has been deeply involved. Its fingerprints are all over virtually all aspects of this grubby exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say in relation to the inquiry that has been called that I will be dealing with that matter, as I always do, in a proper and prudent matter. It will be an arms length inquiry from me. It will be an open and transparent inquiry. It will be conducted fairly. All those who have any possible interest in the subject matter of this inquiry will be able to present their views. But I do say this: in the interest of good government in South Australia, the Premier of South Australia should not proceed with the royal commission that he has already announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will be writing to Premier Brown, impressing upon him the concerns that the Commonwealth has about his foreshadowed course of action and urging that the royal commission, with power to compel people to give evidence about their spiritual beliefs&mdash;virtually unprecedented in Australian public life&mdash;not be proceeded with and that the South Australian government cooperate with the Commonwealth in respect of its inquiry to end this matter once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier on I tabled two transcripts in respect of radio interviews given by two people who were referred to in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> and elsewhere as having claimed that beliefs were fabricated. I did that in order that the media, which has not really had the opportunity to peruse these transcripts in detail until now, will at least set the record straight, and that includes the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>. It seems to me that much of what has been written in recent days about the issue of Hindmarsh Island has been based on a lack of awareness about what the Federal Court has said in respect of this matter and without the close scrutiny of a number of clear rebuttals of allegations that have been made by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude with a plea to the opposition&mdash;I think at this point it will be one that will not be heeded. Eight months after the promise of the coalition policy on Aboriginal affairs we still have a total absence of any policy. I urge the coalition to stop playing politics with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, to stop using Aboriginal affairs as a party political football, to review their policy and to do so with good grace and decency and, in the interests of this country, to move to the greatest extent towards cross-party cooperation in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This censure motion is about whether or not the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) should resign. I am saying, as the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> said this morning, that he should resign. There has been a bit of shouting done about this matter in the chamber in the last few days, but I think there are some very quiet issues I would like the minister to address. He has said that he has always sought to bring together the parties&mdash;the Aboriginals and others&mdash;in this matter. I will read out to you a media release that Mrs Wendy Chapman put out some days ago. My office has spoken to the Chapmans, but I had not spoken to the Chapmans until yesterday. I was reminded of this media release when I picked it up off my desk. Mrs Chapman says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the six months before he banned the bridge on six separate occasions we requested Mr Tickner to meet us to hear our case. Despite his own ministerial department advising him to meet us, he ignored us.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Tickner, she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . strenuously resisted our lawyer's attempts to obtain copies of all relevant documents in the court case.</PARA>
<PARA>I said in this place yesterday that on three occasions discovery was attempted and that on something like six or more occasions there was a freedom of information request. On almost all of those occasions&mdash;not all&mdash;it was resisted. In the end, in some matters his adviser said Mrs Chapman gave evidence, which she did, that some of the relevant documents had been destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two weeks ago&mdash;and this is the point I want this minister to address, which he has never discussed, and this is nothing to do with the court case; this is nothing to do with the Federal Court appeal&mdash;the most serious allegations imaginable were made by some very senior and very delightful people that the women's business was a hoax. They had to make a very serious decision whether they were going to stand up and say so in the face of their Ngarrindjeri people. Has the minister talked to them? Of course he has not talked to them. Has he had anybody from his department ring them up and say, `You have come out and given evidence that wasn't there before.'? `It has nothing do with the court case; it is new evidence&mdash;people who are retiring, who are quiet, people who do not take the public eye'. No, the minister has not. Why not? Because it has obviously put a hole in the declaration he made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think Professor Saunders did a very good job, but I am not accusing her of much because she did not have all the information. I have raised this two or three times in this place. The only woman who was used as an original source of the women's business, that is, Nana Laura, 88 years old last year, perfectly healthy, and was known to the minister&mdash;he had a letter in his hands in his office&mdash;and who was known to the minister's staff as being the only original source of this women's business information, was still alive last year and she was not asked. Why don't you look up and face this question? She was not asked because Professor Saunders did not know about her. She did not know about her because obviously Doreen Kartinyeri, who is obviously central to this whole thing, and much quoted in the Saunders report, did not tell her. Or, if she did tell her, then Professor Saunders did a worse job than I think she did. I do not think she did a very good job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why she did not know was that the minister had her name in a letter&mdash;the only person alive; the others had been dead for 12 or 15 years&mdash;and her name was never told to Professor Saunders. After the minister read the report, in the 30 hours he had to read the report, he knew, or his advisers knew, that her name never appeared in those 56 pages, and none of his staff went to check. So the whole of the basis of the women's business, if it were true, had one central source alive. Was she ever asked by anybody? `No.' Why not? Was it ever checked by anybody on your staff? `No.' Why not? `Don't know.' `Why would we know?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason is that this minister had made up his mind of the general direction. Why had he made up his mind of the general direction? Because he had a couple of letters. That was one of the letters he had. The other one came from the first meeting, which was really quite seminal in this whole matter and which I raised the other day. Its first public genesis was on 9 May on Hindmarsh Island. At that meeting, 15 women were asked by the Lower Murray Aboriginal Heritage Committee to come down there and solve a problem for them. What was the problem they had to solve? Mr Neale Draper&mdash;not Nelly Draper; not a woman, a man&mdash;had just completed a report for the South Australian government. That report was not going to be good enough; that was their dilemma. That is what they told these 15 women. That report was not going to be good enough to get the bridge banned&mdash;which was their objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So they said to the women, `You have to do something.' They brought Doreen Kartinyeri down to the meeting from Adelaide, and she said, `I know the answer. The answer is that that is where all our ancestors' babies were aborted when our ancestors got pregnant by white men.' So they wrote the first part of a letter to the minister, and they took it to the other side of the island where other people were, including the white lawyer for the Aboriginal legal rights movement for South Australia, Tim Woolley. He said to them, `This is not good enough.' So another part was added to the letter later in the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do honourable members think that said? They were whole sentences straight out of the report from Mr Neale Draper&mdash;a man&mdash;and that was sent to the minister. We would think that anybody who was really cognisant of the fair result would have twigged that here were sentences that not only have nothing to do with women's secret business but have come out of a report written by a man. One letter came on the 9th, but the one from Doreen Kartinyeri on 12 May said, `I've been aware of women's business for a long time, but I have just become aware of the exact place to which it refers,' and she referred to three sources, two of whom are long dead and one still alive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the minister appointed Cheryl Saunders&mdash;a woman, of course; I am not criticising that&mdash;to have a look into the women's business matters. These matters are not part of this court case. The court case is a Federal Court appeal about procedure and whether the process which took place was correct. As one of my colleagues said to me, what ought to be addressed is whether that meeting did take place. What happened at that meeting? What were the facts surrounding that? Did that meeting take place on Hindmarsh Island with men guiding the direction of the conversation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings us to Doug Milera, because he was there. I have to back up the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who just put a hole in the veracity of this minister's argument&mdash;or lack of it. The last things that Doug Milera said in a six-page interview, a long interview, with Keith Conlon on ABC radio yesterday morning&mdash;Falstaff at the table tried to obfuscate this thing yesterday by reading stuff from earlier on&mdash;were, as the interview states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONLON. . . .and I think you said it last night, that you were the person who invented the story. Do you stand by that?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MILERA. . . . Yes. OK. If you want to.. I tried to avoid this, but if you want to say that, I did invent it, OK.</PARA>
<PARA>Milera then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let everybody in South Australia know that I was one of the instigators who created this story to stop the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA>He was not asked to say that. He volunteered that of his own volition. Conlon then said to him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What's that got to do with understanding women's business on Hindmarsh Island?</PARA>
<PARA>Milera says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That women's business is all fabricated.</PARA>
<PARA>Conlon then said to him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The women made it up?</PARA>
<PARA>`Yes. You want to talk anymore, because I'm gettin' sick of talkin' to you,' says Milera. That is the end of the interview. So at the end of the whole of that stuff&mdash;six pages of it&mdash;Milera is asked the seminal question and he said, `Yes, I fabricated it.' So do not try to come in here and tell us some other story. One more thing I might say about Doug Milera is that he was the central applicant for the bridge ban. One has to recognise this. Let us now look at a couple of other matters. Wendy Chapman states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the 10th of last year Mr Tickner made his bridge ban and has brought down the whole crushing power of the Commonwealth onto my family based on his half-baked investigation. A few days later our company went into liquidation as a result.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for you getting the people together&mdash;the Aboriginals on one side and the white people and the developer or investor on the other. So much for you getting those people together. Wendy Chapman says she tried six times to get together and you would not come to the party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was amused when you said a minute ago something about spending money like a drunken sailor. Well, my goodness me! As I understand it, your whole operation will probably cost the Commonwealth millions&mdash;maybe tens of millions&mdash;of dollars in the end. The list of costs includes an estimate for the Saunders inquiry of $250,000; Aboriginal applicants' legal costs of $100,000; costs of the court case being judged&mdash;court staff, court costs, Mr Tickner's costs and Aboriginal residents costs, et cetera, of $600,000; cost of full court appeal, $250,000; minister's office internal costs&mdash;being Sue Kee's time and other staff&mdash;$100,000 now; ATSIC costs, $300,000; and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But on top of all of that is the loss to the developers. I do not believe that these developers should be chosen over anybody else. But what is absolutely paramount is that this minister&mdash;a minister in this position who has the chance to make a declaration&mdash;must make a declaration when he can get as close as possible to the truth. We now have a whole lot of information which shows what he may have thought was the truth. I think he was part of the conspiracy&mdash;maybe unwilling and unwitting or maybe too stupid to know any better. When the minister read that Saunders report he knew that only four women had said they knew anything&mdash;out of 1,600 women, or is it 2,000? How many women were there? Other people have disputed the thing since then. The minister should have known better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another subject I want to raise is about when you take somebody's asset away, acquire that asset&mdash;not quite the same as an acquisition of land&mdash;with all the might of government. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was alluding to my use of documents. I will tell you why I used those documents. Forget about the secret documents, because we might yet find that the secret documents have as much authenticity as a promise from the Prime Minister inside them; that is possible. My use of these documents was because I knew that this minister had not given up on discovery all the documents he should have given up. When I got those documents it was patently obvious that he had not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me talk about responsibility. Four hundred pages of representations came to you, Minister. One of the people who made a representation was Mr Ian Webber who is known to a lot of people in this chamber. He is the chairman of Mayne Nickless. He has also been on government inquiries and has headed them for the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and for other people. Mr Webber received a letter from ATSIC saying, `We've got an FOI application. Do you mind if we spread your financial details around.' He wrote to Professor Saunders and said, `How is it that ATSIC has a copy of my private representations which I wrote to you? They are only for you and the minister,' or words to that effect. So Professor Saunders said, `I don't know. I sent them to the minister.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there has been a change of arrangements from ATSIC, but there were 400 pages of representations. Not only that; the ATSIC letter said, `We would like to hear what you say, but we're not sure that we will take any notice of you even if you object.' So all of Mr Webber's private business could go to anybody who puts in an FOI. As it turns out, that FOI was probably from Chapman's lawyers because they wanted to see what the representations said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minister talks time and time again about handling things properly; he has not handled things properly; he has not gone into depth in this matter. I think that he should resign, as the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> said this morning.

The first occasion you ran on this was not because of your concern for the developers&mdash;you opposed the construction of the bridge as being commercially stupid&mdash;and it was not because you thought it bankrupted the people concerned, because they were in receivership before the minister got anywhere near the decision.

There was at least some argument at some stage about whether it was purporting to be a religion but was in fact involved in doubtful psychological practices. That was the issue of the day, so at least there was that rationale behind acts that were associated with banning it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In this case, this is a royal commission simply into spiritual beliefs. It is not a royal commission into the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, his department or his handling of the issue. It is not a royal commission into that. No royal commission in South Australia is empowered to investigate that anyway. As far as I can see, Dean Brown has not been stupid enough, in this unprincipled act on his part, to attempt to do something that is not within his power to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he has done is to target&mdash;with Star Chamber powers, 16th century investigative powers, which is what royal commissions have&mdash;a group of women's religious beliefs. That is what he is doing. He is using a royal commission power, which is generally used to get at illegalities, corruption and manifest failures of public policy. This royal commission is not into public policy at all; it is into a group of women's spiritual beliefs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You talk about the whole might of the state and the Chapmans. You talk about the whole might of the state and a court case&mdash;when court cases are run routinely anyway on appeals against this or that government decision at any point of time, where normal rules of evidence apply, where rules relating to hearsay apply and where there is some level of discipline in what is put before them. You contrast that&mdash;the imposition of a state in that circumstance&mdash;with the putting in place of a 16th century Star Chamber to investigate the religious beliefs of a group of women in South Australia. This is an act of infamy that will go into the records of white-black relationships in this country for many years to come. You are part of it; you are part of that process which has produced this act of infamy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimatums by pipsqueaks suggesting to prime ministers that they have 48 hours to respond will, at the end of the day, produce a foot firmly planted between the buttocks of those pipsqueaks. Nevertheless, the Premier of South Australia suggested that, before he put this Star Chamber in place to investigate Aboriginal women's beliefs in South Australia, the Prime Minister might like in those 48 hours to consider what he intended to do. As it is, what the Premier was running along with, as the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has foreshadowed many times, was his preparedness, at the completion of the judicial process that is currently under way, to see a further judicial process instigated into not women's beliefs per se but the way in which the determination was made and the grounds on which it was made&mdash;in other words, something relevant to the issue of the day as opposed to targeting the women and their religious beliefs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premier might have anticipated what ought to be a prime ministerial response to that. But, without waiting 48 hours, he shot from the hip, went charging out and stuck that royal commission in place. We now have a totally infamous situation of a royal commission into religious commitments of a section of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it does not matter to the Liberals opposite because, as I said yesterday, they have that Midas touch. They can say the words, but they cannot sing the song. Whatever they might say, when it comes down to dealing with issues that relate to Aboriginal affairs they have a Midas touch of failure. Every time they are actually brought up to the mark what comes out is vicious racism. That vicious racism is reflected here in the only ever, in Australian history, royal commission of inquiry into religion, outside of that Church of Scientology process. </PARA>

All that you have chosen to feed off is related to the statements that are alleged to have been made by the various Milera's in particular.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, let me go through Sarah Milera's comments on all of this. She is obviously a person being torn about by it. She had this to say about her former husband's views on whether or not the story was fabricated. Nicoll, the interviewer, read her a quote from her husband and asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What do you think of that?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MILERA: Disgusted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NICOLL: Why?</PARA>
<PARA>She also said, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On weakness, it is time to back off because there is no way he would know about women's business. Number one, he wouldn't know about business. I lived in the same house as him and he wouldn't know it because I wouldn't degrade myself by telling him.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on, and Nicoll said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said that you and he got carried away with the whole thing and got caught up in it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MILERA: That's not so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NICOLL: So, you stand by your claim that the stories are not invented.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NICOLL: So the information that has gone to Robert Tickner, in the first place is accurate. The women's business material is accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MILERA: Originally?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NICOLL: Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MILERA: Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues, and Nicoll said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look, let me take you back and I have to keep coming back to this because it's turning out to be the central issue whether you like it or not and that's the women's business. Now, there is no way I can ask you what it is. I simply ask you again. Doug's claim that that story about the women's business that had the bridge stopped was invented specifically to stop the bridge, is that accurate or is it wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MILERA: That is absolutely stupid. That is ridiculous thing I've ever heard. How can we not say things. We are Ngarrindjeri women. How can it not be true. That's silly, that's silly. That man's got no qualification to say that.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NICOLL: Oh, we're getting down to small bits and pieces here. I think the major issue still remains doesn't it, whether or not the women's business exists. You say emphatically that it does.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MILERA: Of course. If it don't, I want to know what qualifies a man to say it.</PARA>
<PARA>There was a quote at the end of a report which started off with Doug Milera saying it was not fabricated, and now you have that. There have been five repudiations of this person, on whose evidence you have been relying, that the story is fabricated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You also had a bit to say about the academic Cheryl Saunders and what you thought of her. When you look at what the academic Cheryl Saunders had to say about this, you have to deal with Justice O'Loughlin's view of Professor Saunders. In his Federal Court judgment, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She performed her tasks professionally, dispassionately and with competence. I reject the aspersions which have been cast on her and the manner in which she has performed her duties.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the view of Justice O'Loughlin as far as Cheryl Saunders and her performance was concerned in this regard. Why did he arrive at his determination? Why make something of the determination? It goes to technicalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidently, one of the things the judge believed was that the minister should have read the secret women's business. That was the judge's view, and the minister quite rightly contested that view. Given the minister's understanding of the sensitivities of Aboriginal women to men reading their materials, or knowing their materials, he made a decision of perfect integrity as far as he was concerned. He said, `I will not do that.' The judge said that he should have done that, so the minister quite sensibly said, `I appeal on that particular proposition.' That appeal does not reflect badly on him. It does not suggest that he is incompetent; it just suggests that he has a disagreement with a judge about what level of sensitivity ought to apply to women's business and its consideration by men. That is all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have now had an opportunity to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to see the comments of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) at question time yesterday. In relation to me, the minister made the following comment: `He doctors every document that comes from my department.' This is a very serious charge and one which is totally untrue. I have never altered any document received from his department, and I ask the minister to withdraw this baseless allegation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Minister for Communications and the Arts, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has answered 74 questions on notice. But to answer them he has, on my arithmetic, taken an average period which exceeds the 90-day delinquency-free period allowed under standing order 150. The minister has 14 questions outstanding&mdash;two since 3 May 1994, which is a period of more than a year. Another of the 14 is question No. 2128, which I asked him more than 90 days ago. Mr Speaker, would you please write to the minister under the relevant standing order and ask him to amend the error of his ways?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">1A</EMPHASIS>) The Minister must ensure that relevant State Ministers and a body or bodies representative of local government are consulted in connection with the preparation of a report under subsection (1).".</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment relates to the requirement that the minister report to the parliament annually on how councils have met these objectives specified for them in the bill and on other matters related to the administration of the legislation. This will include the extent to which the funds have been allocated on a horizontal equalisation basis, and on the performance by councils of their functions, including the efficiency and provision of council services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The Australian Local Government Association and the state and territory ministers believe the government has reached a firm undertaking that any reporting arrangements are to be made to the local government ministers conference. The federal government had agreed that reporting on councils' performance would be dealt with under the auspices of the regular local government ministers meetings rather than to parliament in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no agreement on the form which the report should take or on the detail of the benchmarking arrangements to be implemented. These issues were to be the subject of further investigations by the officials and advice to the next ministers conference, which is going to be held next year. The opposition's amendment requires the federal minister to consult with relevant state ministers and local government in the preparation of the report to parliament. I expect this will resolve many of the concerns raised about the reporting process and ensure that the minister honours at least the spirit of the undertakings he has reached with the other levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the minister is prepared to accept this amendment. I thank the government for accepting this and previous amendments, seeing some sense in them and agreeing to the position of the opposition. It is certainly pleasing to see that the minister has acknowledged that there is need for continued consultation with the third sphere of government in this country. He holds, as we do on this side of the House, that as a matter of great concern. I can only ask that he reconsider his opposition to the provision according the status of disallowable instruments to the national principles and the intrastate distribution of the financial assistance grants. Parliament must be allowed to scrutinise the distribution of these funds, and the minister should honour the agreement he has struck to allow this scrutiny to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I thank those members on this side of the House and the other side for their valuable contributions to debate on this bill. Whilst we had some differences of opinion, the debate was fruitful.

I also want to thank the clerks for the assistance we have had from them in the preparation of our amendments. So often they get overlooked by this House in their preparation for the day-to-day running of the House and also in the preparation of amendments. I thank the clerks for their help.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, together with the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 1995&mdash;known as the charge bill&mdash;completes the package of legislative measures introduced last year following the government's 1994 budget initiative to replace the existing $25 departure tax with a $27 passenger movement charge to fully offset the cost of customs, immigration and quarantine processing at Australia's borders and the cost of issuing short-term visitor visas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation passed by the parliament last year as acts Nos 146 and 159 of 1994 set the new rate of charge at $27 in respect of departures from Australia after 1 January 1995. At the time that legislation was being considered by the parliament, the government also made known its intention to commence negotiations with international air and sea passenger carriers to have them collect the PMC as part of their ticketing arrangements, thereby removing the need for departure tax stamp booths at international departure points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Negotiations with airlines are in their final stages and the airlines' representatives have given their in-principle agreement for the airlines to enter into arrangements to collect PMC from passengers departing after 1 July 1995. For the first 12 months of the new collection regime, when airlines will still be establishing collection procedures, the PMC stamp booths will remain at international airports to ensure that those passengers who have not prepaid the PMC as part of the price of a ticket will be able to pay before departing Australia. The airlines understand that, at the end of this transitional period, the booths will cease to operate and the airlines will assume sole responsibility for PMC collection. A further arrangement will be negotiated with the airlines for the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the new collection regime, this bill will replace the existing 24 narrowly defined categories of exemption from PMC liability with 12 broadly defined categories of exemption, both to facilitate collection of the PMC by airlines and shipping companies and to clarify the operation of the new collection scheme. In particular, item 4 of the schedule to the bill provides that a person departing from Australia will not have to pay the $27 PMC in relation to his or her departure, where that person is:</PARA>
<PARA>.under 12 years of age; or</PARA>
<PARA>.a traditional inhabitant of the Torres Strait travelling in connection with traditional activities; or</PARA>
<PARA>.a member of the defence force of another country, or that person's family, who departs from Australia in the course of their duty on a military aircraft or ship; or</PARA>
<PARA>.the crew member of an aircraft or ship, or a member of their family, or a crew member who is being repositioned; or</PARA>
<PARA>.a passenger who is in transit, or departs Australia after entering because of an emergency or other circumstance beyond his or her control; or</PARA>
<PARA>.a foreign diplomatic or consular staff member; or</PARA>
<PARA>.a passenger on a cruise type journey which involves multiple departures from Australia, where the PMC has already been paid in respect of a previous departure during the course of that journey; or</PARA>
<PARA>.a person travelling to Area A of the Australia-Indonesia zone of cooperation in the Timor Sea in accordance with the Timor Gap Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This final category has been included as a consequence of the amendment in the charge bill to treat departures for installations in area A in the same way as departures for other countries as both require customs and immigration processing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does not oppose the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill and cognate bill. As has been stated, similar legislation has been dealt with in the parliament previously, the difference being the date of implementation. The government originally proposed to commence on 1 January 1995 the process whereby airlines will collect these fees, but it would have been completely impossible for the airline industry to have made the necessary adjustments to its ticketing procedures in that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that, notwithstanding that it was the coalition that forced the government to change the date from 1 January to 1 July, there is still some doubt as to the capacity of the airlines to transfer on this date, because we note that the booths are going to be maintained for 12 months. That will be at substantial cost to the revenue, which is not mentioned in the financial impact statement associated with the second reading speech. On the other hand, I assume the government is taking the view that the matter is already a matter of cost and will continue as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we thought it appropriate that the airlines be given six months, we question the extension to 12 months. Many of us would be aware that it is a fairly simple process in many other countries. You approach the departure counter and check in with your luggage. You are told what the tax is and you pay it on the spot. Obviously, the preferred position for the client is to have the amount included in the charge when the ticket is purchased. It would appear to me that the second option would be for it to be collected as people check in if that has not been done, which might be a good reason why the booths are not required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clearly a very expensive matter. For a long time I think the government avoided this very sensible decision because of threats of industrial action by those operating the booths. We have apparently got over that, but one might wonder whether the extension to 12 months results from the need to service the community or whether some deal has been done&mdash;for something that would appear on the face of it to no longer be necessary. We will leave that for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) to explain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been mentioned, the bills deal with the procedures to impose this charge and to require the airlines to collect it. The other most notable thing about the bills is that there has been a reduction in the number of people who are exempt from the charge. There used to be 24 categories and now that has been reduced to 12. The parliamentary secretary did list those in his second reading speech, but I will refer to them briefly. They include, quite properly, children under 12 years of age. Also included are traditional inhabitants of the Torres Strait, which apparently is the result of a treaty we have with people who I thought were Australians. But, if there is such a treaty, we have a responsibility to honour it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is quite appropriate to exempt members of the defence forces of other countries&mdash;that is probably a simplification&mdash;from the charge when their departure is undertaken in the course of duty and they are on an aircraft or a ship of a defence force. Of course, spouses and children of such defence members who depart with that person are also exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Crew members of ships and aircraft departing Australia, and spouses and children of working crew members travelling aboard the same ship or aircraft, are exempt. Positioning crew members&mdash;that is, passengers on ships or aircraft who depart from Australia in order to later become crew members of that or another ship or aircraft&mdash;are exempt. This category would include, for example, airline personnel who travel on an aircraft as passengers from Sydney to Honolulu to take over as crew on the aircraft on the Honolulu to Los Angeles leg of the journey. Again, that makes infinite good sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transit passengers are another group that will not incur the charge. Emergency passengers&mdash;that is, persons who arrive in Australia because of an emergency on board their ship or aircraft&mdash;are exempt. Passengers on board cruise type journeys that involve multiple departures from Australia where the charge has already been paid in respect of a previous departure are exempt. Diplomatic and consular representatives and members of certain international organisations are exempt. Finally, passengers who depart for area A of the Australia-Indonesia zone of cooperation in order to prospect for petroleum or undertake petroleum operations are also exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred at the beginning of that list to defence forces. Of course, Australian Defence Force personnel travelling on official duty will no longer be exempt from the charge. I guess it is simpler, but it is robbing Peter to pay Paul. It is purely a round robin of payments, similar to the way the government applies the fringe benefits tax to itself. I am not really sure that it is a good idea, but as one who has a portfolio interest in the Australian defence forces I wonder whether there is an appropriate refund coming from this particular charge or whether it is just another backdoor way of reducing outlays on defence. I have a feeling it might be the second. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary should have a substantial interest in that, considering the make-up of his own constituency. I trust he will be making representations to see that the amount of money involved is refunded, as it is supposed to be with fringe benefits tax. I now understand that a full recoup of fringe benefits tax levy is not necessarily repaid to the defence department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills will also tighten the exemption category relating to transit passengers. This is expected to raise an additional $1.5 million in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no further comments to make on the bill. As I said, the matters have been previously dealt with by the parliament. We think this sort of collection is a sensible proposition. It is much more convenient to passengers. It should represent a worthwhile administrative saving to the government with no substantial costs to the airlines involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I make the point again that, having extended the start-up date by six months in previous legislation, I am surprised it is thought necessary to maintain the booths for 12 months. I think that should be monitored. I can assure the parliamentary secretary that people do not enjoy running from one place to another to get those stamps on their tickets. They will demand that the airlines provide this service much quicker than that. It would be silly to find ourselves in the situation where we are manning booths all round Australia with practically nobody using them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my intention to delay the House tonight since the passenger movement legislation has previously been before the House. I will just say that the history of this particular charge had its genesis in 1978 with the recommendation of a $10 departure tax, which was designed to fund tourism promotion for Australia. We know the history of that. What I find interesting is that a number of us have stood by the original 1978 recommendation that, while a $10 departure tax should be imposed, it should be collected by the airlines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that, after a brawl of some 17 years, finally the airlines are going to collect the charge for us. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), said, it will get rid of those dreadful cages which are quite frankly one of the greatest turn-offs that we have to present to international visitors who are coming to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a change in the nature of the charge as well. The $27 is very much a passenger movement charge whereas the original concept of the $10 departure tax, which was designed initially to promote tourism, ended up in general revenue. At least now we have a true system of user pays, and I appreciate that. It is always a bit of a worry when these charges are tucked away, and it is incumbent on all of us to make sure that we do monitor the rate of payment on this particular charge. Once you get a hidden charge, it is possible to have it increased by stealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing we do not want to do is make ourselves non-competitive in world terms. We are not there yet. In fact, the passenger movement charge in, say, Heathrow in London is much higher than it is here&mdash;it is about #40. If you look at Europe and the United States, which also have passenger handling charges incorporated in the price of tickets, Australia's charge is about average. But we must be absolutely sure that we do not let that get out of hand. We are seeing a tremendous increase in the number of people coming to Australia, and we are seeing a moderate increase in the number of Australians going overseas. So the revenue that is coming in is quite considerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the projected growth, an awful strain is going to be put on some of our infrastructure. Earlier today we were talking about the future development of Kingsford Smith airport and Sydney West airport. That is only one area where the strains are going to come. In my home state of Queensland we are seeing enormous growth in Brisbane airport, which is one of the fastest growing airports in Australia, and in Cairns and Coolangatta. When the privatisation process is duly over, I am sure that some of the first moves to be made will be to make sure we have the capacity to handle the number of international visitors coming through those gateways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the passenger handling charges, while that might help in a direct sense, the government is also going to have to look at what it might do with the infrastructure behind the airport. I refer to infrastructure such as hotels. An amazing situation is taking place in Australia at the moment: in a city like Brisbane, it is almost impossible to get a hotel room. During the week the major hotels are reporting 100 per cent occupancy rates and on the weekends, 85 per cent occupancy rates. It is a similar situation on the Gold Coast and in Far North Queensland. We have a real difficulty because the developers are saying that the new hotels, unfortunately, even with the loadings that are going into them, do not stack up economically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that future governments would look at some way of encouraging further investment in the hotel industry. If we do not, we will not be able to handle the potential volume of traffic that is out there wanting to come to Australia. I welcome the changes to the method of collection. I welcome the fact that this is now a true-user pays principle. I welcome the fact that after 17 years the airlines are finally going to collect the charge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) commented that airlines should collect the passenger movement charge at the time of checking in. This course of action has not been taken as airlines currently do not have the cash collection or handling facilities at their check-in counters. Setting up such a system for the first 12 months would be at considerable cost to the airlines, and they are doing their best to collect it at the time of the sale of the ticket. Maintenance of the booths that currently have the necessary collection facilities for 12 months to protect the revenue to be collected is a reasonable compromise. I am sure that most members would agree with that.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have deployed a few people to Cambodia, Rwanda and Mozambique.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a great deal of concern about the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill and the Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Bill. It seems as though the legislation has been designed to solve a problem and that is the problem at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. If you read the explanatory memorandum it becomes quite clear because it sets out a list of criteria and talks about the method by which airports can be declared. In the explanatory memorandum it says, `At this time, only Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport meets these criteria.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no difficulty with the concerns people have about airport noise. In fact, I listened to the contributions of the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) and others who live in the area. They raised the concerns of people in their electorates about the additional runway at that airport. What concerns me a great deal when looking at the level of noise that is being emitted in and around the Sydney airport is that the noise contour levels have been based on projections to the year 2010. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I compare the level of noise at that airport to the level of noise that some of my constituents face with Moorabbin airport right now, not in the year 2010, it causes me great concern and leads me to raise a couple of questions. When we look at the noise contour levels for schools that are set out by the government in this legislation we find that the level is 20 to 24. Parkdale Secondary College, which is in my electorate, is under the flight path of one of the runways at Moorabbin. The college is in a contour level above that specified and it will get absolutely no benefit whatsoever out of this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the legislation was set up to look after airports across Australia, I would be prepared to look at it and accept it, but it is not. Why can the people of Moorabbin not be taken into consideration with regard to this legislation? In this legislation jets are the basis upon which the levy will be applied. The legislation looks at a number of categories of jet including the 747-400, the 767-300, the 737-400, the A300 and the BAe 146. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) said earlier, we have a few concerns about this legislation being applied to the Bae 146 because it is one of the quieter aircraft around these days. A lot of its design work was done to enable it to get into airports at all hours of the day. That is the case in any other part of world, but it will not be the case under this legislation that is before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the type of aircraft that fly into Moorabbin, we find that they do not fit into these categories of jet. They are smaller aircraft and in many cases they are older aircraft. They fly in at a lower altitude and when they exit the airport area they fly out at a lower altitude. Therefore, because they are older and slower they are over the houses for a longer period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard in the debate that 60 aircraft an hour fly over Sydney. Moorabbin has one of the largest air traffic patterns in the Southern Hemisphere as far as small aircraft are concerned. In fact, we have had up to 220-plus aircraft per hour in that area. I really have to ask whether this is being done in the interests of everybody in Australia or just those in Sydney. If this legislation is only for Sydney airport then you have to ask whether this is a political solution to pacify people in Labor electorates in and around Sydney airport. You have to ask whether consideration has been given to anybody else in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aviation Noise in 1985 sets out the noise contour levels around airports. If honourable members looked at those figures, they would see that there were high levels of noise around Sydney airport at that stage. In the 20 to 25 noise contour level, 22,708 homes were listed; in the 30 to 35 level, 7,863 homes; in the 35 to 40 level, 2,242 homes; and in the over 40 level, 565 homes. That was in 1985. Ten years in advance and all of a sudden the government is taking an interest in noise contour levels, but for only one airport. It does smell a bit. It smells of an interest in one particular airport and no consideration for the people in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that I obviously have some concerns about levies being applied on some of the aircraft that would fly in and out of Moorabbin. I think they are paying a reasonable contribution through other pieces of legislation that have passed through this House previously. It seems to me that, if we are looking and talking about the consideration of people in this community, we must take into account the fact that people near airports such as Moorabbin are being substantially disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will not provide at any stage&mdash;unless we have a mass import of jet aircraft into Moorabbin&mdash;for these noise contour levels to be taken into account and for people to be compensated. I had a look at the houses near Moorabbin airport. More than 250 houses are affected between the 20 and 25 level of contours, and some 50 houses are affected between the 25 and 30 level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one place that particularly concerns me is Parkdale Secondary College. Its current noise contour level fits into the category of those places near Sydney airport that will be taken into consideration, but the school misses out totally on consideration. I would have thought that the students of Parkdale Secondary College are just as important and should have the same opportunity as other students to receive a good education. They need the appropriate amount of insulation in that school&mdash;insulation similar to that in any of the schools in Sydney. But this piece of legislation does not allow for that sort of insulation to be fitted in that school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not looking at small amounts of money. The original amount was $180 million. It is up to about $260 million now; I do not have the specific piece of paper in front of me. A considerable amount of money will be put into looking after this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to look at what it is not doing for electorates other than those in Sydney. I can see absolutely nothing in this piece of legislation, except a cynical exercise to politically look after Labor members of parliament and Labor seats for the next election. I can see absolutely no other reason for this piece of legislation. If there were another reason, the kids in the schools in my electorate would be protected in the manner in which those in Sydney will be protected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased on this occasion to follow the member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), because the contribution I want to make in the brief time available to me is very much along the lines of the comments he made. I support the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995, but I do not think it goes anywhere near far enough. The legislation effectively applies only to jet aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to represent an area of Australia which abuts an airport called Parafield in South Australia. Parafield happens to be the second busiest airport in this country in terms of take-offs and landings. The reason for that is that in the 1980s the state government agreed to the establishment by a private organisation of an aviation college which day by day is becoming busier and more successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome for many of my constituents has been absolutely horrendous. The impairment of their enjoyment with the amenity of their houses is certainly equal to that suffered by people in the Sydney area as a result of the aircraft noise at Mascot. The difference is that, with light planes at Parafield, it is a constant drone&mdash;vroom. All day, every day, approximately every one to two minutes they get this constant drone. This is an absolutely horrendous problem, particularly for people who are elderly or for those who are shift workers. Although there are curfews, there is very little let-up&mdash;weekends, public holidays, on it goes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly do not think it is good enough to have legislation that simply concentrates on Sydney airport. We should have had legislation that protected constituents across the nation, regardless of whether they are affected by Archerfield, Moorabbin, Parafield or wherever else. I certainly urge the government to take seriously this plea. The people whom I represent are mightily aggrieved by this. They feel their rights to enjoy their houses in the manner in which they expected to be able to enjoy them have been taken away from them by the establishment of the aviation college. I think it is urgently necessary that we do something to relieve the pain and suffering that these people have been afflicted with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That contribution really was quite typical of the contributions we have had from government members, including the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), in the Main Committee earlier today. It really is quite hypocritical. They are the government; this is their legislation. There is a problem with it. This is our point&mdash;the point put by the member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), the point put by the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the point I am putting: this is lousy legislation. The government is bringing it before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Watson, in his contribution, in the Main Committee, made a pathetic attempt&mdash;he was jumping up and down, he was red in the face&mdash;to deflect from himself and his colleagues any blame at all for the current situation around Sydney. He knows that that is not the case; he and his colleagues are entirely responsible for the situation that exists at the moment at Sydney airport. He tries to blame us for the third runway. Where was he when the legislation was approved for the go-ahead of the third runway? He was over there, voting for it&mdash;and yet he tries to shift the blame!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that he and his colleagues that he mentioned&mdash;the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch) and the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton)&mdash;got up and ranted and raved about why the third runway should not be built. But when it came to the vote, they voted in favour of it over on that side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hypocrisy for them to talk this way, as did the member for Watson, the Chief Government Whip, in the Main Committee earlier today; just as it is also hypocrisy for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who happens to have an electorate that is affected by aircraft noise, to come here and talk about the inadequacies of this legislation when he represents the government. I assume that he is not going to have any more the courage of his convictions than had the member for Watson or than have any other members here&mdash;and that is to vote against the legislation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not good legislation; that is the point that we are making here in this debate. It is the current minister's fault that we have this problem at Sydney airport simply because the arrangements that have been put in place in respect to Sydney airport suit the Labor Party. The member for Isaacs made that point&mdash;they suit the Labor Party. That is why we have this problem. I dispute what the member for Watson said&mdash;and I took and still take a lot of interest in airports&mdash;that there was any understanding that the east-west runway was to be shut down. There was not. That is a decision that the government has made subsequently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, part of the solution to this problem is the reopening of the east-west runway. The flight paths in place at Sydney airport are just ridiculous. You only have to go from Canberra to Sydney a number of times and have to land into the south to realise that you go almost halfway to Brisbane. Clearly, that is because the east-west runway has been closed down and that has caused the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total closure of that east-west runway is a blatant political act. There are problems caused by the parallel runway, by the thrusting on to that runway. You cannot say to people who did not have aircraft noise at all before that the airport was there before they built their homes, because that is not the case. They did not have that aircraft noise before and the fact is that the noise could be minimised substantially for them if the east-west runway is reopened. That is really the answer to that problem. I will not let those opposite get off that easy with trying to shift the blame for the fiasco we now have at Sydney airport from themselves and the minister. It is absolutely on their shoulders and they cannot get out of it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the parliamentary secretary, who spoke before me, I also have a noisy airport in my electorate. I will make a few remarks about it. Coolangatta airport is a very busy airport, indeed. Unlike Parafield, which the parliamentary secretary referred to, Coolangatta airport is busy not only by virtue of light aircraft movements which, I agree with him, are often as intrusive for residents as jet aircraft or turbo prop aircraft. Light aircraft can be intrusive for people, and that is certainly the case for people at Parafield, Bankstown, Moorabbin and most of the secondary airports where a lot of training flights go on. A complaint I get from residents who live around Coolangatta is that it is not always the movements of the heavier aircraft that affect them but that it is often light aircraft because of their persistent droning, as the parliamentary secretary said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will ask a couple of questions. I do not know whether there is anyone here intelligent enough to answer them. I do not know who is going to answer the questions. With the greatest respect to the Chief Government Whip and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Ms Crawford), I suspect that I will be wasting my time asking the questions, but I will try. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To answer the previous questions to some extent, there is a mechanism here whereby other airports can be brought into this system. The legislation actually says that if an airport is a qualifying airport at the commencement of this act, the minister must place a notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, et cetera. The question for those of us who have are affected by aircraft noise is: what do we have to do to qualify them? To partially answer the question&mdash;I have managed to find this out so far&mdash;you have to have some noise amelioration project in place for your airport and then it can become a qualifying airport. Then, aircraft landing at that particular airport will be levied and there will be some compensation for people who are affected by aircraft noise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some concerns with the whole principle of this levy. Beside the fact that it is in place simply to suit the Labor Party with its situation at Sydney airport, it really does add, and is intended to add, to the price of tickets. Aeroplane travel in this country is already expensive enough and I must say that I object to this mechanism. I suppose those opposite will get up and tell us that it is the great user pays system. In my view, the FAC, which the member for Watson tipped on very heavily this afternoon, could pick up the tab for it, or the government could pick up the tab for it. I am concerned that if we move to have Coolangatta airport qualify as an airport for this process, that will add to the cost of tickets to Coolangatta. That is obviously not in the interests of the tourism industry. I have a problem with the whole fundamentals of this, of doing it that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned about aircraft noise at Coolangatta. My constituents know how much I have done to help with that problem. I have taken a very active interest in that. We have changed approaches and departures to Coolangatta airport. We have had the 727 aircraft, which was the main offender, virtually banned from Coolangatta, except in exceptional or emergency circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I claim, and my constituents know, I have done a lot to lessen the problem of aircraft noise at Coolangatta airport. I monitor it&mdash;I talk to the tower, I go down and watch what happens, and I ensure that it is complying with the noise alleviation procedures which have been introduced; that is, aircraft depart and arrive as far as possible over the water&mdash;that aircraft remain over water as far as possible when arriving and depart over water as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still think there is a problem with some noisy aircraft during the night. I have argued for some sort of curfew at Coolangatta airport. The two ministers I have taken that up with have not been prepared to accept that. There is a need for some aircraft movement during the night. We get our newspapers early in the morning and the aircraft that bring them in are different aircraft from time to time&mdash;some are noisier than others. We need to have our newspapers, but there are freight movements during the night that we really do not need and I do not think need to come in during the night. I would still argue that there needs to be a partial curfew at Coolangatta airport, and I will continue to pursue that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with noise at Coolangatta is still a very serious one. If we take the government's intention with respect to Sydney airport, then there would be every argument for making Coolangatta a qualifying airport as far as this levy is concerned. Let me make the point again: I do not want the price of travel to Coolangatta to go up so I object to the principle of the levy, but if we can find the money I certainly want to do something for the local residents but not by virtue of this mechanism. I am between a rock and a hard place on this particular one, as you can see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983, we had 86,000 aircraft movements to Coolangatta. By the year 2010, that will have doubled to 160,000 movements. As I said, we have had the 727s thrown off Coolangatta. With quieter aircraft the problem is being improved but obviously with additional aircraft movements the cumulative noise is having an impact on residents. We have already seen that the effect of cumulative noise from even light aircraft can be very intrusive. Although we have quieter aircraft in the newer generation aircraft&mdash;the 737-400s, the later versions of the 767s, the airbuses&mdash;we are going to have to put up with an increasing number of movements between now and the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out that even the 1993 ANEI, the noise index, actually shows that there are some homes surrounding Coolangatta that are in the greater than 35 category. This area is designated or believed to be suitable for industrial use only. Light industrial facilities in the area should be insulated. We actually have some homes in that area. We have quite a number of homes in the greater than 30 category. For that reason, aircraft noise is a problem now, but it is going to be an even bigger problem in the year 2010. The Australian noise exposure forecast for that actually shows the situation to be very much worse. A considerable number of homes at that particular time will be in the over 35 category, a significant number in the 30 to 35 ANEF and a greater number again in the 25 to 30 category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My point is that Coolangatta airport is a major problem as far as noise is concerned. It is a very busy airport. It is becoming busier all the time. For me, as the member in whose electorate the airport half falls&mdash;the border between New South Wales and Queensland goes through the middle&mdash;it remains something that I need to be very concerned about for the future, as far as both my present and future constituents are concerned. I do, as I say, take a very active interest in this. It is no use saying to the people in this area that the airport was there first. I do not think that has ever been a valid argument in my view. The fact is that many of the homes surrounding Coolangatta airport have been there for a very long time also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people bought those homes many years ago the airport was a small airfield and aircraft noise was not a particular problem. Now Coolangatta has become one of Australia's busiest airports. It is a very popular tourist destination. It is the gateway to the beautiful Gold Coast and the Tweed areas. Coolangatta airport is a very different proposition now to what it was some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I say to the government that I do not have much sympathy for this legislation at all. Apparently some government members do not have much sympathy for it, either. Our contribution on this side has been along the lines that we believe the thing is largely flawed, that it is an attempt to fix up Labor's problem with Sydney airport. The government is doing it by adding to the cost of airline travel in this country, and I do not think that is a good thing. In the end I hope that the people who travel on aircraft will come to realise what a mess this government has made of Sydney airport. </PARA>

<PARA>To explain the amendment&mdash;because if you just read the amendment you would not have the faintest idea of what it meant&mdash;the whole purpose of the bill that we have been debating since this morning in the second chamber and that my colleagues have been debating in this chamber this evening is to raise money to pay for the insulation of houses surrounding Sydney airport, a very substantial amount of money, in the order of $200-odd million. To facilitate the raising of that money, the government has introduced the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995. The bill will be the vehicle through which the moneys are raised for the insulation of these houses around Sydney airport that are so adversely affected by the government's totally dishonest and incompetent handling of the second parallel runway at Sydney's Mascot airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is proposing that at the completion of each financial year the levy per unit be increased by 10 per cent. The amendment that we have just moved affects the way in which this 10 per cent increase is to apply. For example, as I understand it, the government has indicated that the maximum levy that will apply for this year coming up is $180 per unit. We heard earlier this morning in the second chamber that the government intends to apply a levy per unit of $155. The government then proposes in the second and subsequent years to increase the levy by 10 per cent. Where we have a difficulty is that it proposes to apply the 10 per cent increase on the maximum levy that could have been charged rather than the actual levy that was charged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case that we are discussing, the levy that could have been charged would be $180. A 10 per cent increase on that would be $18. The actual levy that the government has announced will be charged is $155. A 10 per cent increase on that would be $15.50. What will happen is that the government will apply the 10 per cent increase to the maximum levy that could have been charged. In other words, the $18 increase will apply rather than the $15.50 increase. The significance of this becomes greater as the compounding effect of this occurs year by year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be remembered that aircraft will not be charged for just one unit; they will charged for several units. Our amendment is designed to minimise the increases that will be imposed on the industry each year by ensuring that the 10 per cent increase is applied to the actual levy rather than the maximum levy that could apply in a particular year. We believe this will save industry&mdash;the aviation industry and the tourism industry&mdash;passengers travelling, business and so forth a considerable amount of money by ensuring that the minimum increase will apply each and every year. That is the rationale behind our decision to put this amendment. I urge the House to support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This debate is not about who is the better Australian. There are decent, passionate, loyal Australians on both sides of this argument. The overwhelming issue&mdash;indeed, I believe the great test, the great answer and the great issue&mdash;is what system of government will best deliver a united, stable and tolerant Australian nation. Let me say that the interests of 18 1/2 million Australians are more important than the identity of one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think even the Prime Minister would acknowledge that the system of government under which we have operated since Federation in 1901 has been highly successful. Australia has been one of fewer than 10 countries that has been continuously democratic for the whole of the 20th century. There are few nations in the world that can boast the degree of tolerance, harmony and stability which has been the inheritance of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As members will know, I have been a strong supporter of the present constitution. I have not disguised that, and I do not disguise that. But, as a political leader and as a passionate Australian, I recognise that attitudes in the Australian community over a period of time have changed. Attitudes towards the constitutional monarchy in Australia are now very different from what they were 30 or 40 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister said last night, those changed attitudes in part reflect the changed composition of our population. They also in part reflect the natural, historical drift apart&mdash;I hope never in acrimony but because we are going, in some respects, our different ways&mdash;of Australia and the United Kingdom. I therefore recognise, as an Australian and as a political leader, that there is a mood in the Australian community to address and to perhaps embrace change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a few things tonight on behalf of the coalition about the process whereby that mood should be addressed, how it can be assessed and how it can best be harnessed to produce an outcome that will unite and not divide the Australian community. It is important that, if change is to occur, it occurs in a uniting and not in a divisive fashion. The great unity of the Australian people is the most precious asset we all have. The greatest obligation we all have, whatever our political beliefs, is to act ultimately on important matters in a fashion that binds together and does not push apart the Australian people. It is important that all of us, whatever our views may be, honestly address this issue and recognise the strengths and the weaknesses of the various arguments that are put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change proposed by the Prime Minister is a very significant one. It goes beyond being a purely symbolic change. If Australia were to become a republic, it would end this nation's link with the second oldest institution in Western civilisation. Some people may find that a source of satisfaction, even joy; some people will be utterly indifferent; other Australians will find it distressing; still another group of Australians will ask themselves whether such a move is absolutely essential in order to finally confirm the independence of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of those issues where a degree of tolerance and understanding, particularly between the generations within the Australian community, is essential. The older section of the Australian community must understand that younger Australians have a different view towards the constitutional monarchy than they do. Equally, there has to be an acceptance on the part of the younger section of the Australian population that the institution is held in very high regard, even with deep affection, by many of the older section of the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have a very strong, free, liberal and democratic system of government. What makes it strong, free, liberal and democratic is that it is built upon two principles. The first of those principles&mdash;and this does not appear to be in dispute between the Prime Minister and me&mdash;is the principle of a Westminster parliamentary system of government. It is not the most perfect system that could be devised but, in that famous remark of Winston Churchill's, it is much better than any of the alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other great virtue of the present system is that we do have a politically neutral head of state. One of the questions that has to be addressed in this whole debate is whether we could possibly devise a system of government in this country which could deliver a more neutral head of state and a more neutral set of arrangements for the head of state than exist at the present time. I want to explore that for a moment by tracing briefly the careers and the contributions to public life in Australia of four distinguished Governor-Generals of this country&mdash;all former politicians, two Labor and two Liberal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of those was Sir William McKell, who in 1947 was appointed by the Chifley Labor government as Governor-General of Australia. On being appointed to that position, McKell abandoned his partisan Labor leanings and discharged his obligation as the Governor-General of Australia with very great distinction. Many members of this House will know that in 1951, when following proper constitutional practice he granted the Menzies government a double dissolution of the parliament, he incurred the wrath of some of his erstwhile Labor colleagues, some of whom took years to speak to him again. But he did the right thing by the office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few people would argue that Lord Casey and Sir Paul Hasluck, as former senior Liberal ministers, were also very distinguished and politically neutral Governor-Generals. Indeed, one of the first events I attended as a new member of parliament in 1974 was a farewell dinner to Sir Paul Hasluck, and I well remember the glowing tribute to his political neutrality that was paid by Gough Whitlam, who was then Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final person in the group is the present Governor-General, Bill Hayden. I acknowledge that when his appointment was mooted I was publicly critical of it because it struck me as passing strange that a person who had publicly expressed such avowed republican views should be offered the vice-regal post. But I equally acknowledge&mdash;I have done it before and I do it again tonight&mdash;that he has discharged his obligations with dignity, fairness and complete neutrality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I simply make about that, and the reason why I briefly traced the experiences of those four distinguished Governor-Generals of Australia, is that all of them have behaved in a politically neutral fashion. All of them, despite their differing political backgrounds, have been subsumed by the great traditions and conventions developed over centuries of the Crown, which have devolved upon the governor-generalship of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, in his proposals last night, has adopted in part the recommendations of the Republican Advisory Committee. He has adopted the proposal that the President should be elected by a two-thirds majority of the parliament. But he has not adopted the proposal of the Republican Advisory Committee that some attempt should be made to codify the powers of the new head of state&mdash;the proposed President of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an interesting proposal, because what in effect the government is inviting the Australian people to do is to accept the proposition that you can without any legal doubt, let or hindrance transfer unimpaired the reserve powers of the governor-generalship to the president in an Australian republic. It is interesting that, on this particular subject, Professor George Winterton&mdash;who I think was a member of the Republican Advisory Committee, is a leading republican and a professor of law at the University of New South Wales&mdash;had this to say, and I think it is worth reading the quote to the parliament because it is relevant to the debate about the efficacy of the proposal put forward by the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Governor-General's powers were inherited by a republican head of state, since the link with the monarchy would be severed, the present conventions governing the exercise of the reserve powers might not subsist. They might if they were regarded more generally as conventions of Australian government, although they are not uniquely Australian, but are, of course, shared with Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and other countries. But if they were seen as conventions of the monarchy, abolition of the monarchy might well extinguish them as well. So a republican constitution cannot simply continue the present constitutional position of conferring powers on the head of state in general terms, relying on the constitutional conventions to govern their exercise.</PARA>
<PARA>I put that forward, and I remind the parliament and the people of Australia that they are not the words of somebody who is resisting change. They are in fact the words of somebody who is an avowed supporter of change. The relevance of those words is that they cast some doubt and they raise questions about the preferred proposal and the preferred option put forward by the Prime Minister last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal of the government is that the future President of Australia should be elected by a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of the parliament. Inaccurately, last night, the Prime Minister said that no party had enjoyed two-thirds control at a joint sitting since the end of World War II. In fact, in 1946 the Chifley Labor government would have had 69 per cent of the members and senators present at a potential joint sitting of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be suggested that that was possible because at that time we had a different method of choosing the Senate. I notice my colleagues opposite nod in agreement, but I might also remind them that it is quite possible for the present method of electing the Senate to be altered by a simple vote of both houses of parliament. It does not require a constitutional amendment. In other words, the present unlikelihood of either side of politics getting a two-thirds majority is not entrenched and, on the Prime Minister's proposals, is unlikely to be entrenched in the constitutional changes that he intends to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night, and I think quite appropriately to a debate of this kind, there was much discussion about the sense and spirit of independence felt by Australians particularly as we approach the centenary of Federation. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, this is not a debate about who is the better Australian; this is a debate about what is the better system of government for the 18 1/2 million people who inhabit this continent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The independence and the sense of independence of a nation are not measured solely in legal or constitutional terms. There is little doubt that the sense of independence, and the sense of national identity, that emerged in the Australian people early this century preceded many of the legal changes that were referred to by the Prime Minister in his speech last night. When we are talking about independence and a sense of nationhood, it is important not only to see it in constitutional and legal terms but also to see it in broader terms. There are, for example, many people who believe that, no matter what our constitutional set up, Australia cannot see herself as truly independent if we continue to labour under the enormous levels of foreign debt that we do at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a couple of things about the prospects that lie before us if the proposals put forward by the government are implemented. The prospect that Australia might end up a federal republic but have one or more of the states continuing links with the monarchy is a prospect that fills me with a great deal of disdain. I do not think it would be an outcome that would be in the overall interests of the Australian nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the House and to the Australian people that the worst possible outcome that we could possibly have in this country would be to hold in two or three years time a referendum on converting Australia to a republic that produced what can only be regarded as an inconclusive result. If one of the tests of whether a nation should change its constitutional arrangements is the test of whether or not that change is likely to build on the existing unity of the nation, surely the time to have a referendum to alter its constitution is at a time when as best it can reasonably be discerned that change is likely to enjoy overwhelming support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to have a referendum in 1998, and that referendum were to be carried narrowly or defeated narrowly, that would be the worst possible outcome. I remind the government and the Australian people that in the history of federation only eight out of 42 referenda proposals have been carried. No major referendum proposal has been carried which has not enjoyed the support of both sides of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the reasons why we on this side of the House believe very strongly that the best way to tap into the mood for change in the Australian community at present is not to go down the take it or leave it path outlined by the Prime Minister last night; rather it is to establish a people's convention, and I will come to that in a moment. In putting forward a proposal for a people's convention, I might remind the parliament that there are other issues of great constitutional significance that many sections of the Australian community would like examined. Many Australians believe that the external affairs power of our constitution is currently being abused. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to the House that it is essential that not only the issue of whether or not Australia should become a republic is examined but also there be a mechanism to examine these other issues. That is why the coalition unhesitatingly recommits itself tonight, if elected at the next election, to establish in 1997 a people's convention to examine not only the question of whether or not Australia should become a republic but also all these other questions that so many other sections of the Australian community wish to examine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat tonight that, if that people's convention is established, it can examine a number of issues. It can examine the role of the head of state in the Australian constitution, including implications of change for the role of the states. It can examine the allocation of legislative and executive powers and functions between federal and state governments, including areas of overlap and duplication. It can examine the use of the external affairs power of the constitution. It can examine the question of whether we should introduce four-year instead of three-year terms for the federal parliament. It can examine the basis on which new states, in particular the Northern Territory, would be admitted to the federation. It can examine any other matters which the convention members would themselves determine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it not strange that a proposal that would allow the Australian people to be involved at the beginning of the process instead of only at the end is greeted with derision by the Australian Labor Party?

I make it very clear that, if a clear consensus emerges from that people's convention, that consensus will be put to the Australian people for approval at a referendum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By having outlined proposals for a people's convention, I believe that what the coalition has done is to provide the best vehicle to enable the range of views that exist in the Australian community on this issue to be properly examined. Even the most objective observer would have to acknowledge that amongst those who want Australia to become a republic there is a deep division of opinion. Even if passing regard is to be paid to the various opinion polls that are held on this issue, there is overwhelming support for the notion that if Australia is to become a republic then the president of the Australian republic should be directly elected by the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That indicates that the range of views in the Australian community is so broad, the idea that the Australian people should be presented with only one alternative&mdash;that is, the alternative desired by the present Labor government&mdash;is a completely unacceptable way to examine the mood for change now in the Australian community. The most effective way of doing it is to provide to all of the Australian people not only a capacity to be consulted, as they must, at the end of the process but also a capacity through a people's convention to be involved at the beginning of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea&mdash;and I say this very seriously to all members of the House&mdash;that the Australian people will accept, without argument or demure, the idea that they are being consulted simply because the matter is being debated here in the House of Representatives or the Senate is not an idea that commends itself to the overwhelming majority of the Australian people. One of reasons why there is a desire in the Australian people at the present time to have an elected President&mdash;if, in fact, we do become a republic&mdash;is a feeling that, no matter what arrangement is worked out that only involves the members of parliament, in some way that will shut them out of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not necessarily a view that I personally share, and I understand many of the reasons why there ought to be a parliamentary process for the election of a President if Australia is to become a republic. But those who want a republic achieved in this country, those who want change achieved in this country, must understand that, if the very strong feelings of the Australian people in relation to the election of a President are not accommodated or at least properly assessed and properly discussed&mdash;and how better can that be done except through a people's convention&mdash;then those who want to bring the republic about will not achieve their goal. No matter how ardent you may be and no matter how zealous you may be about bringing about a republican change, you have to recognise that there is a spectrum of views in the Australian community: there are people who want to retain the present system; there are people who want to have an elected President; there are people who want the parliament, by a two-thirds vote, to choose the President; and there are a large number of people who might want, through the processes of consultation and the processes of change, to consider other options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the beginning of my remarks I indicated that although this was not an issue that touched upon the daily lives of Australians; although this was not an issue that would affect the living standards of Australians; although it is an undeniable fact that whether we become a republic or remain as we are will not have any impact on the level of unemployment, the level of social deprivation or the level of social privilege that might be enjoyed by different sections of the Australian community, it is nonetheless a very important debate about the future of this country. It is a debate that ought to be conducted with a goal of achieving&mdash;if there is to be change&mdash;a change through a process that unifies and does not divide the Australian community. No matter how strongly people may feel on either side of the debate, the fact remains that that sense of unity and that sense of oneness are not present in the Australian community at the present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do want to achieve change that unifies and does not divide, then we need to choose a method of facilitating that change about which the entire Australian community can feel comfortable. That is why the coalition has proposed the idea of holding a people's convention. If this debate bogs down into a slanging match as to who is the more patriotic Australian, if this debate bogs down into some kind of stupid points scoring debate about whether we might sell more coal or more wheat or more services into the Asian Pacific region&mdash;if this debate bogs down into that kind of rather pointless points scoring, then I think the Australian community will suffer and the Australian community will be the poorer as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great problem with the approach outlined by the Prime Minister last night is that he will not give you, the Australian people, the referendum question&mdash;that is, the referendum option that you want. He will pass through the parliament without your involvement the referendum proposal that he and he alone wants. He will then demand that you answer his question at a national referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our approach is quite different. Our approach is to involve all of the Australian people at the beginning, the middle and the end of the process. Our approach includes all Australians. Our approach is to allow you to help decide the kind of constitution the Australian people want for their future, not the kind of constitution the current Prime Minister wants for your future. Our approach is to allow the people of Australia to decide not only the questions and the options but also, fundamentally, the referendum itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our view is a fundamentally democratic view. We believe the people of Australia cannot be involved enough in deciding the future of our constitution. With an issue as critical and as important as this, there cannot be too much democracy. That is after all a possession of all of the Australian people, not just of the 148 members of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian constitution is no more Paul Keating's constitution than it is mine. All Australians should have an equal say in its future and in our country's future. The Prime Minister believes that any involvement by the Australian people is too much involvement. He believes you should be involved only in the final stage and that you should be asked merely to adjudicate on his question about your constitution, rather than allow you to be part of the creation of any change if that is what you want. That is why the only way to properly handle this matter is through the people's convention of the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me first take exception to the assertion by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) yesterday that Rockhampton is the beef capital. Casino, in my electorate, is widely recognised as the beef capital, and I would hope to have some support from the National Party in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few things certain in life and amongst those is that the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), when he gets up and speaks, will offer no policy ideas. Another, of course, is that whenever the member for Gwydir, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, speaks on the meat industry, he invariably takes the tack of kicking the unions, of running the meat industry down and of being a prophet of doom. His evidence yesterday to show that this gloom was justified was that an Australian firm had thought about importing 15 container loads of meat. That is very flimsy evidence, because Australia is a major exporter of beef, a major player in world terms in Japan, in Korea and in the United States. It is a $5 billion industry and we do it extremely well. That is not to say, of course, that there cannot be improvements in efficiency, and one of those areas that does need attention is the industrial relations side. But this will never be achieved by simply kicking the industry, kicking the workers in the industry and telling them that they are no good. It will be achieved through good, solid legislation such as this that moves things forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation represents a major step forward for the meat and livestock industry by providing commitment to the industry's workplace agreements through the establishment of a meat industry council. It will give the industry a greater role in responsibility in deciding its own affairs, and that must inevitably result in greater productivity and efficiency from a less regulated environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meat and livestock industry is one that Australia depends on for much of its primary industry revenue. We owe it to the industry and also to all Australians to prove that we want a strong and efficient industry, an industry that can reach its potential. But at the same time we want to provide a sound framework so that we can continue in a way that will allow flexibility and reform and a firm commitment to secure more employment for future Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of a meat industry council is the most appropriate way to develop strategic policy and planning and to address the meat industry's costs and competitiveness issues. The Meat Industry Council will take the responsibility for strategic planning and then provide the framework for the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Meat Research Corporation to develop their corporate and operational plans. The Meat Industry Council will also be responsible for the funding of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Meat Research Corporation through the power to recommend levy rates to industry annual general meetings. The MIC's new component will reflect the expenditure on functions that the MIC is taking over from the AMLC and the MRC. Therefore, it will not add to the total levy and charge collected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to stress that the new arrangements are not expected to impose any additional costs on the Commonwealth and, more importantly, any additional costs on the industry at this time. The Commonwealth will also continue to make matching payments for research and development expenditure from the meat research and development fund up to a maximum of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production of meat and livestock, as determined by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions ensure that programs of the AMLC and the MRC conform with the industry's strategic goals, directed through the MIC. The legislation gives the meat industry a greater role and responsibility in deciding its own affairs and the ability to move to a less regulated environment. Although it is transitional and eventually the three statutory industry authorities will revert to a non-statutory status, a framework will be established where the industry can operate over the longer term. It is of utmost importance to the meat and livestock industry that a meat industry council be established as a part of the whole decentralisation process. The ultimate aim of this legislation is to improve efficiency whilst maintaining a strong body to direct and focus the industry's strategic direction through the AMLC and the MRC. </PARA>

The MIC will ensure that the industry is able to identify its problems and, consequently, provide it with the framework to enable commercial responses to be formulated to combat difficulties. Ultimately, this will take the financial responsibility off the shoulders of the producer and take it out into the national realm. This will encourage easier access to greater competition and, inevitably, a more cost-effective industry. </PARA>

It is a national promotion for the beef industry, an industry which is a major source of employment, not just in Casino but throughout the north coast.

We must overcome the preconceived idea that industrial relations is a big stick wielded by the government to bring industry into line. The establishment of the Meat Industry Council will allow for autonomy and a state of binary opposition that will promote flexibility and cost efficiency and, whilst maintaining national unity, will provide a strategy and a framework to work in. </PARA>

This is a crucial responsibility of the MIC if it is to work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The cognate debate this morning on the meat and livestock industry legislation provides an opportunity to talk about the marketing and sale of livestock in Australia. Much discussion has occurred in recent times on the selling methods available to producers for the sale of their livestock to domestic and overseas markets. One thing is for certain&mdash;that farmers want a fair and adequate return for their stock, which can be achieved where true market forces operate in a competitive environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This can be achieved in a number of different ways and there is no doubt that saleyards will continue into the future in Victoria and throughout Australia. New selling methods, both on farm and off, certainly have a place, as do the new technology sales using video facilities. However, it is generally agreed throughout the industries that saleyards will remain the primary method of selling stock through a competitive bidding system in the long-term future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue, therefore, is which saleyards will grow and which saleyards will diminish and eventually close. The area that I represent, Bendigo, has the largest or equal largest sheep and lamb saleyard in Victoria and it will continue to play this role in a long-term future. The Bendigo saleyards recently opened a new on-scale selling facility for cattle, and that will help the city of greater Bendigo and the farmers in that area move with modern trends. There are a number of smaller saleyards in Victoria which are unlikely to survive into the future. However, it would be inappropriate for me to speculate on which these may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The city of greater Bendigo is committed to maintaining a major saleyards operation in Bendigo. It is presently looking at a relocation of the saleyards which will ensure that Bendigo continues as the largest, or equal largest, sheep saleyards in Victoria. It will be also doing significant work to ensure that cattle, pig and, possibly, other sales will grow significantly. Saleyards throughout Australia, and particularly in Victoria, have a good future. While we acknowledge the existence of other forms of selling, saleyards will still be the predominant form of livestock selling in Victoria for the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to quote some figures in relation to the throughput of the saleyards in the Bendigo area, and then relate that back to the stock figures of sales in Victoria. At the city of greater Bendigo saleyards in 1993-94, the yardage figures relate to the various stock categories for that year, and they are: sheep, 875,980; cattle, 37,493; pigs, 30,380; and calves, 1,725. The figures from the saleyards of Victoria, where there are some 30 saleyards&mdash;there are smaller ones, but they do not keep reliable stock figures&mdash;show that, in the same year of 1993-94, Victoria had a total stock throughput in these categories: sheep, 4,950,891; cattle, 1,265,687; pigs, 59,010; and calves, 82,602. Some of those numbers have been down through those years; but, once the impact of the drought through northern central Victoria is removed, I am sure those numbers will increase once again. Cattle numbers have declined significantly for a number of reasons, one being the drought; but there certainly has been a decline, and there may have been lost opportunities in the livestock marketing and selling area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about the economic benefits that a saleyard can bring to an area. I refer to a document prepared by Crichton Maxwell Pty Ltd in May 1995, so it is absolutely current. That firm was asked by the city of greater Bendigo to evaluate what the economics of saleyards did to the economic region. It came up with an appraisal of what the economic benefits of livestock selling would be for an area, and it particularly directed its attention to the city of greater Bendigo saleyards. It found that the total employment generated by the saleyards is conservatively calculated at 317 people, with an overall annual economic value to the city of greater Bendigo in 1995 of some $18.45 million. There would be few industries in the city of greater Bendigo that could match that result in terms of employment and economic value generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employment figures are made up in several different ways. Firstly, the figures for direct employment generated by the city of greater Bendigo saleyards and those employer categories are: stock agents, 40; transport operators, 30; city of greater Bendigo personnel, 5; making a total direct employment of 75. Then there are all the indirect employment categories which support the city of greater Bendigo saleyards including truck servicing, engineering firms, shearers, tyre suppliers, the water supply authority, fuel companies, stock and station firms, car retailers, and transport operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That also flows on to other areas of activity such as the retail sector in the city of greater Bendigo. The latest estimate of retail turnover in the city of greater Bendigo, taken out in 1993, was $442 million. That figure has been transferred to an employment generating figure as a result of direct saleyards activity. The saleyards directly employ 75, as I indicated; saleyards agricultural indirectly employs 112; the retail sector directly employs 52; and the retail sector dependent employs 78&mdash;totalling employment of 317 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members can see that the saleyards are a very strong economic stimulus and a very strong livestock selling centre bringing direct economic benefit to the whole community. The direct cash flow generated by the city of greater Bendigo saleyards includes: stock agents' commissions, approximately $2.15 million; yardage fees, approximately $0.5 million; and transport charges, approximately $3.7 million. Some 80 per cent or $2.96 million flows directly to the region and the remainder goes to other regions, making a direct cash flow generated by the city of greater Bendigo saleyards of $5.61 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing in mind the economic stimulus that saleyards create and the importance of the livestock industry to the city of Greater Bendigo, one would have to wonder why in 1985 the two Labor members representing the area&mdash;the former federal member for Bendigo, Mr Brumby, and the former Labor member for Bendigo West in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, Mr David Kennedy&mdash;rejected government assistance of over $1 million to provide upgrading and relocation of the livestock selling centre in Bendigo. That money was to be available in 1985 under an employment creation grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, that allocation was not taken up. That was the opportune time to relocate because there had been a decline in numbers and it was an appropriate time to introduce all the new technologies that the saleyards could produce. Modern technology was evolving using a range of video facilities for on-farm and off-farm selling of livestock through saleyards. However, as a result of the reluctance of these two members to take up the additional funding that could have been made available, Bendigo lost the opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal to relocate the saleyards has been accepted by the rural community. A great deal of consultation has been achieved by the city of greater Bendigo. Discussions included a range of people, including stock and station agents, stock and station managers, farmers, stock buyers, stock traders, transport operators, Bendigo business houses, Department of Agriculture staff, and agricultural economists. These people were of the view that saleyards would play an important part in the marketing and selling of livestock into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The summary presented by Crichton Maxwell Pty Ltd says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The COGB saleyards are seen within the livestock industry to be one of Australia's premier selling centres, even though outdated facilities are used.</PARA>
<PARA>Crichton Maxwell Pty Ltd refers to the fact that an opportunity existed in 1985 to upgrade and to relocate the facilities, but that the opportunity was not taken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stocks sold through the saleyards are drawn from a large proportion of Victoria and also from New South Wales. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, directly to the north of my electorate is a large dairying industry and there is also production of fat cattle. Had the saleyards been upgraded and new technology introduced back in 1985, greater impetus and a higher yardage of cattle from the area would have been attracted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The saleyards are a substantial generator of both direct and indirect employment, creating some 317 jobs directly and indirectly. Of course, economic benefits flow as a result of saleyards operating in that location: farmers come in and out of the district; agents come from all over Australia; and buyers come from all over the world to purchase livestock. The saleyards provide a very strong economic stimulus to the Bendigo region. The total employment generated is 317, with an overall economic value to the city of greater Bendigo of $18.45 million. The summary presented by Crichton Maxwell Pty Ltd states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objective in relocating the COGB saleyards, should be to establish a Regional and Victorian Agricultural Centre that is the focus for a 200km radius, based on Bendigo, but also for a large part of south western NSW.

<PARA>The farming community wants the opportunity to present stock to buyers in the best possible condition. Farmers want a fair and adequate return for the livestock that they are marketing and they want that return to be achieved in a competitive environment where true market forces operate. Whether attempts are made to sell stock at saleyards or out on a farm, the farming community is looking for a fair and adequate return for its efforts when stock is presented to the market in the best condition possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the future of saleyards, obviously the numbers of saleyards throughout Australia will diminish somewhat because of the introduction of new methods. The city of greater Bendigo is taking important steps to ensure that the area in which it is located is the leader in the sale of livestock. The city of greater Bendigo wants to ensure that the conditions presented to farmers and to buyers are the best that are available so as to ensure that the area holds its place in the very important function of the sale of livestock in Victoria and throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the low points for Bendigo is the loss of an abattoir which was located in the Bendigo area. The abattoir was operated by the Victorian Inland Meat Authority. When the abattoir was sold, ownership was transferred to a number of owners and it ultimately ended up as a part of the Mayfair group. At one time, there was an industrial dispute at the abattoirs. The industrial dispute was being resolved at a local level until Mr Wally Curran, Secretary of the Australasian Meatworkers Union, pulled the workers out on strike. Mr Curran kept them out on strike and then he departed for an eight-week holiday overseas. Regrettably, the meatworks did not ever recover from the strike. Bendigo lost the abattoirs and 600 people lost their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bendigo never recovered from that. It is an important adjunct to have a meat processing works which can use the livestock selling centre of Bendigo in providing a service to it and in providing both domestic and overseas killing facilities, so that the livestock can actually be processed in the area where the saleyards operate. That situation was to the detriment of Bendigo and it has had an impact on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The city of greater Bendigo has picked up the challenge of providing better facilities for the rural community and for the buyers in this most important industry, the meat and livestock industry. I have expressed the wish of the rural community to have these facilities upgraded, relocated and providing the absolute best conditions available for the rural community to achieve a fair and adequate price for their livestock. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most senior person we spoke with was the Vice-President, which is almost as high as you can get. After that we met Pat Roberts, who was the chairman of the House agriculture committee. Senator Richard Lugar was very involved in his preparations for announcing his candidacy for the presidency, and we were not able to see him, but we also had very useful talks with other officials in Washington such as the Library of Congress research people involved in the formulation of the policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's primary producers should be aware that there is not going to be an easy answer to this. There are basically two farm bills coming through. One is from the Senate, sponsored by Senator Lugar, and he is making a much stronger move and seeking to have the subsidies reduced significantly. The one coming through from the House takes a much softer approach, and is more concerned with maintaining the subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everywhere that we went throughout the United States on the rest of the delegation, we told people that we had been talking in Washington about this on behalf of Australia's primary producers, and all the Americans said, `What's going to happen?' Nobody knows. The reality will probably be that the subsidies will be reduced to some extent. We should realise that it is not just EEP. There is a whole range of ways American primary producers are subsidised&mdash;like the food stamps program, which is bound up with welfare as well&mdash;so it is very important that we understand what is happening there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the Americans do have to reduce their deficit. Theirs is on the same scale as the deficit of this government. Let us, while we are at it, realise that that deficit is not a surplus of $700-odd million. What a confection! What a farce! What fairy floss from the show! The real deficit is at least $8 billion. The New South Wales farmers have recently published a journal which quotes from Bain and Co. and shows that the real, fair dinkum deficit is probably over $12 billion. That is going to impact severely on Australia's primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I have the floor, Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to make a point about the primary producers in my electorate of Cowper. I note what the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) and the member for Leichhardt have been saying about their particular areas. The north coast of New South Wales is the major cattle breeding area for the whole of New South Wales. In fact, 70 per cent of the cattle bred in New South Wales are bred on the north coast. It is a particularly important industry for the north coast of New South Wales. We have major saleyards at Kempsey which handle a lot of cattle. Again, at Macksville there are excellent saleyards, and the major abattoir that we have is Midco at Macksville. I have to give full praise to the management and workers of Midco. They do a tremendous job, and produce great exports for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is worth noting that the meatworks at Macksville used to be a cooperative. Unfortunately, they fell upon hard times some years ago. When I was first elected in 1984 they were in a situation where a receiver had been appointed. They were in great trouble, so much so that one of the first things I did on being elected to this parliament was to have the Parliamentary Library prepare a special research paper on the economic impact on the Nambucca Valley, should that meatworks close. That is how close it was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there are differing views about importing capital, and particularly about the impact of Japanese investment in Australia. But I must say that, since the Midco meatworks at Macksville was purchased by the Japanese firm Mitsubishi, that meatworks has gone from strength to strength. It has had its ups and downs but, by and large, it has been the iron lung of the Nambucca Valley and also, of course, beyond. People from places such as Stuarts Point and Bellingen actually work there. There are hundreds of employees. Over the last 10 years, I do not know how many millions of dollars Mitsubishi has invested, but it has made major investments, sometimes of $20 million in one whack. To go through that works and see the men at work is a great pleasure. The equipment and the lines are state of the art: all stainless steel. The efficiency of those fellows, as you see them working on the beast, is a joy to behold. They are really great people. The primary producers are well served by that abattoir.

I will definitely be delighted to contribute to the debate on the second reading of the Meat and Live-stock Industry Bill 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted, as I was rushing here, that my colleague the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) did draw attention to the shadow spokesperson's contribution in the Main Committee yesterday. Indeed, I was physically in attendance and listened without any interjection to his speech, irrespective of the fact that he referred to me in less than helpful terms. Any review of the transcript of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in the debates in which I have followed the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) would indicate that I have acknowledged his commitment not only to his constituency but also to the industry. I certainly have not put out press releases as he has done: misrepresenting, in this case, me, as member for Capricornia, and based on a complete misunderstanding or mischievous analysis of what I said in the House. Had I had his press release at the time, I would have referred to him specifically in my explanation to the House a few weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I will pass over that matter, because the member for Gwydir, the opposition spokesperson, did raise some criticisms of this bill. Firstly, he criticised the fact that it was actually being debated in this chamber, a criticism which I thought was irrelevant. He indicated that the opposition would, in general, support this bill with a second reading amendment. We should remind ourselves that the Cattle Council of Australia and all the peak bodies involved in the meat industry in this country are supporting this legislation and these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Gwydir criticised the lack in the bill of any procedures to implement the Industry Commission report. From the report, he quoted the first couple of paragraphs of the overview. Indeed, he quoted from the very first paragraph. We have to be very careful of selective quoting; and, while I do not deny that what the member quoted was exactly what the report says, let me read from the end of the overview about the effects of the Industry Commission's recommendations. In part, the conclusions of the overview read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission's recommendations build on reforms which have been initiated over the last decade. They have been made with a view to facilitating the transition from a commodity based, adversarial industry with low levels of skills towards a modern, collaborative and productive industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, they are designed to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">increase the level of skill in the workplace, the flexibility with which it is deployed and the level of workplace health and safety; assist the process of achieving greater market access for Australian meat and meat products; increase commercial incentives for firms to conduct their own research, development and market promotion . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is, they have been designed to take government off the back of the industry. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has indicated that he wants to take government off the backs of the people. In this bill, the government has provided for the industry to take control of its destiny, to take control of its own procedures and to make itself more competitive and outward looking. Yet all we get is carping criticism from the opposition and a pretty fair wallop of union bashing from the opposition spokesperson, the member for Gwydir, yesterday. But I digress from the effects of the recommendations of the Industry Commission, which continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . increase the extent to which the industry, whether on its own or in collaboration with government, is able to adopt a means of ensuring the hygiene and safety of its output at least cost&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>obviously a key issue for exporters&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">increase the capacity of producers and processors to receive feedback on how they can each meet each other's needs; reduce the level of direct public sector involvement in the industry; and facilitate measures to reduce costs and increase productivity in all sectors of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>These are commendable recommendations. The matters in the bill, involving the restructuring of the industry, are designed to produce those results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that we have to be very careful about is to make sure that all parties in the industry are involved, including producers. For too long, there has been a tendency, particularly among members of the opposition, to say, `It is the meat processors, in particular the meat workers, who cause all the problems.' The member for Gwydir referred to the Booz Allen and Hamilton report for the Cattle Council of Australia, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">International comparisons in the beef processing industry</EMPHASIS>, which is an excellent document. His aim in referring to this was to show how uncompetitive the Australian beef industry is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important points made on page 35 of this review is that up to 70 per cent of the processing gap&mdash;defined in the report as $198.49 a head&mdash;is beyond the control of processors, but that around 30 per cent is addressable. It is very important to know this. All sectors of the industry, particularly the processing end, are willing to address that issue. The report does make international comparisons, but it is misleading for the member for Gwydir to mention figures from industries in countries such as Argentina and America, when the report itself clearly makes the point that only 30 per cent of this is to do with the processing industry. This is hardly the point made by the opposition spokesperson and comes from a report initiated by the Cattle Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other report that the member for Gwydir used was the report made by Fellows Medlock and Associates, dated March 1995. This was a report to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of progress in workplace reform in the export meat processing sector</EMPHASIS>. I am delighted that the opposition spokesperson referred to this, but once again he quoted rather selectively to suggest that all the problems in the meat processing industry were the fault of the unions. I believe that this is unhelpful to the debate and I will refer to aspects of the report to clarify the position. It will be instructive to all members. Under the heading `Difficulties or impediments to enterprise bargaining' the document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a number of evident impediments to enterprise bargaining are dealt with throughout the report and are summarised below. The major impediment lies in the attitudes of the industry's employers, union officials and employees. Whilst employers and unions have expressed positive views about the need to change, this has to a large extent not been reflected in action. That this has not occurred illustrates the poor relationships which exist in the industry with trust and goodwill clearly lacking. Where co-operative relationships have been established, it is possible to point to progress in improving productivity at plant level.</PARA>
<PARA>The key issue for this industry is making a difference to that cost gap of 30 per cent, but it will require changes to the culture of the workplace: changes in the attitudes of management, of unions and of the work force, and not only at the national level but also on a plant-by-plant basis. There is evidence that, where the culture of the workplace is an issue and there is a need to educate and train employees and take them through the process, you can actually achieve very positive results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that I think is important is this: what are the impediments to change? This is referred to on page 5 of the report. Impediments to change identified by this report included the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a) Employers: with some exceptions, the industry's individual employers generally display a traditional and narrow approach to relations with their employees and unions and have failed to acknowledge change where it has occurred. The concept of Best Practice is not well understood by the industry's employers who have generally looked for excuses rather than accept that the initiative for reform must lie with management.</PARA>
<PARA>And the report is critical of the union and the work force. In the industry, there is a clear lack of unity and common purpose among all participants. Failure to support the central role for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the absence of a respected and visionary employer association are major impediments to reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make these points to indicate that there have been initiatives on all sides, from the processing end, from the producer end and from the government end. Indeed, our reforms have reflected that change. However, we are talking about a very conservative industry on both sides, an industry where there has been a tendency to use very out-of-date industrial relations mechanisms on both sides but where there is a preparedness and a willingness to change. However, that has to be capitalised on. The conclusions in the overview state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the on-going debate about the relative significance of workplace reform in the overall competitiveness of the industry, there is a broad agreement among the various parties that reform will improve performance at an individual and company level. However, before sustained improvements can be achieved, it is essential that a clear, consistent and supportive message is delivered at the workplace by both employers and unions. From the views expressed during the course of this review, it is evident that sufficient commonality exists for the parties to develop a shared agenda as the basis of a commitment to a widespread education process about the need for, and benefits of, workplace reform. The challenge for all the parties involved will be to translate their support for reform into a concrete action plan for change at the individual company level.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the challenge for this industry and the one that all of us should be supporting. Having gone through a very effective consultation process with all players in the industry, the Industry Commission, on page 29 of its report, concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All parties expressed scepticism about any ability to achieve reform at the industry level. There is no body, at this stage, which has sufficient respect or support to be able to play a role in bringing the parties together to foster reform. While reform must be focused at the individual plant level, an industry-wide vision for change, supported by agreed principles and a broad action plan could play an essential role in educating the parties and facilitating enterprise level reform.</PARA>
<PARA>It is certainly the case that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is one party to that reform but, if management and unions think that is the only way to do this, we will not achieve a great deal. The unions have shown a preparedness to be very flexible but, at the same time, that must be based on some degree of trust and confidence so that, where agreements are developed, employers will follow through on their promises. There is no doubt that educating the workplace, which is as much a challenge to the unions as it is to the employers, is going to be very important in this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give a classic example of this issue in my electorate of Rockhampton, where Australia Meat Holdings is at present in dispute with the AMIEU. I have had discussions with some representatives of AMH. I have discussed with them the sorts of initiatives the company has put into its operation at Guyra, which I dare say the opposition spokesperson must know about because it is in his electorate. He did not mention it yesterday. I think that at one level AMH is keen to adopt productive processes whereby it can initiate the sort of changes that are needed to improve capital utilisation. I have not had a chance to talk to the employees as Guyra but I know the union has some concerns about the way the process was developed. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Life</EMPHASIS> of 1 June, the AMH chairman, Keith Lawson, is reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Enterprise bargaining does offer the industry real hope. It will have significant ramifications and it is important that producers understand that reform has been resisted and is therefore slow," Mr Lawson said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"But we are committed to getting it right. It is our only hope of survival against international competitors."</PARA>
<PARA>The problem is that at the bottom end of this kind of process we have got a situation at AMH Fitzroy Abattoirs, in my electorate, where the employees, having gone through a long process of trying to develop an enterprise agreement and working under an industrial award from the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission, became so frustrated that they walked off the job one Friday afternoon. They did not follow the disputes resolution procedure technically, but they were prepared to come back on the Monday and to re-initiate the process if they could get some commitment from AMH to follow through on the promises that had been made. What followed was essentially a lock-out of the work force, with public pronouncements by the industrial relations spokesperson to the effect that the company was simply going to re-hire anybody who would come&mdash;precipitating a strikebreaking operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union, in attempting to get a resolution according to the agreed-upon disputes resolution, spent considerable time attempting to get some agreement with the AMH representative and in the end had to go back to the Industrial Relations Commission. That will be heard tomorrow in Brisbane. At the same time, I understand, AMH was in the Industrial Relations Commission because it is in conflict with MATFA over whether or not it should be a signatory to the industry-wide award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I understand the frustration and concern of AMH, the way it has gone about attempting to resolve this dispute will not forward an effective, productive enterprise bargaining agreement. The work force believes that the management will re-employ a number of the workers but pick off the workers that it does not want. The resolution yesterday at the picket line was that all workers would re-apply for their jobs but the union expected all its members to be re-employed, so that the enterprise negotiation would go ahead. In fact, the union officials obtained a commitment from the work force that workers would not stage any sort of walkout unless it was sanctioned by a state official. The union officials in this situation have worked very hard to forward the process of enterprise bargaining, but feel a great lack of confidence in the position of management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this kind of industrial dispute that, in my view, will put back enterprise bargaining for years in Rockhampton. It is an industry that is absolutely essential to the economy of Rockhampton. We have had the Smorgons Lakes Creek meatworks closed all year, because Smorgons decided to divest itself of its entire company structure. </PARA>

They need to provide education and skill formation, and they need to do something constructive about bringing their work force with them. AMH may well decide that it can just pull the pin and move its operations but that will not help the beef producers of Central Queensland. At the moment, because our two meatworks are closed, our cattle producers are having to freight their stock to Brisbane. The cost involved in that is huge. I was at a meeting at Claremont where the AMH representative was having a crack at workers by saying, `It's all the fault of the work force.' The producers were saying, `Yes, that is true.'

All we hear from the opposition is criticism, in spite of the support of all of the peak bodies to this legislation. The government is once again delivering on reform. It is about getting the government off the back of the industry and about asking the industry to take responsibility for its processes, to become competitive, to get niche markets and to make sure of the product that it is producing. One of our problems is that we do not grain feed a lot of our beef. We still use open range and that makes us less competitive. There are a number of issues involved here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the House's attention not so much to the industry problems that other members have outlined but to the exotic animal disease aspect of this legislation.

It may be a fairly roundabout process but I ask the House to bear with me as we trace the change in the processes used by the government, and the animal quarantine and export branch of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service. I think we can find part of the answer there that we need to have if we are going to build a safe and secure animal production industry in Australia. Safe and secure animal production for Australia is critical. Not only must we have an input into research and development, and the latest techniques of production, but we must be safeguarding our great industries as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to take the House back to the notorious case of the import of pig meat, take that as a case example, look at poultry production and draw from that some conclusions as to what might be proper practices and policies for this nation in the future. As far back as 1988, there were circulars from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy with regard to pig reproduction centres and pig import conditions. Those circulars laid out some of the criteria that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy sought to impose upon those people producing pig meat in international circumstances and the conditions of quarantine that would apply should Australia consider the import of pig meat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, there was great activity in the pig and poultry industries, as growers and producers tried to assess what, for them, was an innovation&mdash;the idea that Australia should actually be an importer of these fragile primary products, which notoriously could present a risk for Australian producers should exotic diseases gain entry into Australia in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, I wrote to the then minister for resources, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), asking him for details. He responded in August 1991. In that letter, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) is a transparent and accountable organisation that uses the best advice available when assessing proposals and developing protocols for the importation of animals and their products into Australia. The procedure followed varies in the detail depending on the perceived risks and similarity of the proposal to pre-existing protocols. There are however some basic steps which are common to all major policy decisions such as producing new importation policies. These are characterised by extensive consultation with scientific and industrial bodies eg the state and Northern Territory agriculture departments or equivalent, the Australian Veterinary Association (AVA), the CSIRO and the National Farmers Federation (NFF). Specialist national industry groups such as the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council and the Australian Poultry Industry Association, are also approached when their industry is involved. Overseas experts and organisations are also frequently consulted on specialised topics and the Veterinary Services of the exporting countries provide information on animal health in those countries. The AQIS Bulletin, a monthly publication available through the Australian Government Publishing Service, carries notices of AQIS's reviews and solicits comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through this consultative mechanism, AQIS obtains the best scientific information on which to base its decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a good letter, and it outlines, pretty fairly, the way in which Australia should look at these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another factor that I will raise later. It is the need for Australia to preserve its unique position, in intensely competitive markets, of having disease free, clean food products. That is something that is a priceless comparative advantage to us in any market. It is something that we need to preserve, because too many would want to see us destroy our comparative advantage of clean products and would want to see extra costs loaded onto Australian producers if we should import disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former minister's letter, of 21 August 1991, seems a reasonable letter. I decided, at that time, to test the minister's response and take up with the international expert bodies exactly what AQIS had done in order to consult widely. I had already consulted the Australian Veterinary Association, the CSIRO and the NFF. I had spoken to and received documentation from the Australian Pig Industry Council and the Australian Poultry Industry Association. The only group that I was unfamiliar with and did not have information from was the group of overseas experts that AQIS had consulted in giving advice to the government on whether or not Australia should import pig meat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote to the universities and national institutions the names of which the minister supplied as having been consulted. I was somewhat surprised by the responses I received. Let me read some of the names of those authorities which were consulted by AQIS as being world authorities which could provide advice on which a scientific decision as to whether or not Australia should import pig meat could be based. The list reads: Agriculture Canada, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Australian Veterinary Association, Bureau of Rural Resources, Cambridge University, Chief Quarantine Officers (Animals) in all states and NT, Counsellor (Veterinary Services) Brussels, Iowa State University, Malaysian Veterinary Research Institute, New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Singapore Department of Primary Production, State Veterinary Institute for Virus Research, Denmark, United Kingdom Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, United States Department of Agriculture, University of Melbourne, University of Queensland and Veterinary Counsellor, Washington. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote to those groups and I would like now to read some of the responses to the House, because I believe that what we have before us is misleading, if not fraudulent, behaviour on the part of AQIS, in the way in which it spoke to the minister and provided advice to the minister. I will read first of all a letter from the British High Commissioner. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Cadman,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his letter to you of 2 August the High Commissioner (who is currently travelling with a visiting British Minister) said that we would be asking our Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if they could provide copies or details of any submissions made by them or by Cambridge University to the inquiry conducted by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) into the import of Canadian pigmeat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministry have now replied saying that they have no trace of any such submissions. I understand that it is quite possible that any contribution which they may have made to the AQIS inquiry would have been provided as answers to specific questions put to them by AQIS, rather than in the form of a written submission.</PARA>
<PARA>A very nice informal approach on such a serious issue, I would have thought, and one completely unacceptable in such important decision taking. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The officials concerned would not necessarily have known that the questions were being asked in relation to an inquiry into Canadian pigmeat. I am sorry to say, therefore, that on the face of it we are unable to meet your request. But if you are able to provide any more detailed information about the dates on which consultations took place, preferably with the names of officials involved, I should be happy to make further inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA>I could not do that, but the British High Commission had full details of the statements by the minister and what the minister said. I had a response from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, from the Bureau of Rural Resources, which gave me some breakdown on costs and charges on an economic basis, from the pig meat people of Australia, from the New Zealand government and from the government of the United States. I would have to say that in every instance of my contact with overseas experts, the response was similar to that of the British High Commission. If contact had been made, it was not known by the Australian representatives on their inquiries with universities, or with specialist groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of deep concern to me that, based on what appears to be false and misleading information, we as a nation made a decision based on a very cooperative attitude from the Canadian government, which had a wonderful relationship with the Australian department and the minister and which said, `There is no risk whatsoever of our pig meat bringing in disease to Australia, and here are the authorities and bodies that we wish to quote.' I would say that is prejudiced advice and, if the Australian government makes decisions in this way, I think that we are in a dangerous situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have before us the proposition that Australia should import chicken meat from Thailand, Denmark and the United States. I have to use this opportunity to raise my deep concern that this not become another process of the type that we saw undertaken by the Australian government or its advisers in regard to pig meat. Fortunately, there have not been any grave consequences of the pig meat importation, though there may have been one outbreak of mystery swine disease created by the import of that Canadian pig meat&mdash;nobody has been able to say yes or no. Are we going to face the prospect of our poultry industry and then our beef industry and other industries being treated in this same way? The minister's letters are very revealing, because the basis of the decision used by AQIS and the government is not on a no-risk policy but on what is an acceptable risk, so there is an endeavour to evaluate the cost of importing an exotic disease and the economic loss against the gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the chicken meat industry, the economic gain to consumers is said to be about $3 million a year. The cost to the industry if there were an outbreak of Newcastle disease is estimated, on average, at about $30 million a year. So if we get one outbreak in a 10-year period, any economic advantage is lost immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In examining the AQIS position, I turned to AQIS's pamphlet on Newcastle disease, which is the disease most likely to threaten the Australian poultry industry. The pamphlet says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Newcastle disease, the most feared avian disease in the world has penetrated into most countries. Australia so far is free from the pathogenic forms of this disease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the disease first enters a country it can cause havoc in the bird industry&mdash;commercial flocks, fancy birds, pet birds and native wild birds are all susceptible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thousands of birds may die. Those that appear to recover can pass the disease on to healthy birds and may themselves remain chronically ill for the rest of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no known cure for Newcastle Disease. The disease is caused by a virus so drugs do not help. Birds continue dying even if heavily medicated.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from an AQIS pamphlet on Newcastle disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sought some expert information. Dr Balkar Bains&mdash;who is one of the most widely respected authorities on poultry disease in the world&mdash;states that the possibility of introducing Newcastle disease through imports of cooked meat is real, that the spread of the disease could not be controlled and that it could decimate the native bird population of Australia. He says, `The evidence is not speculative, it is real.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know and admire Dr Paul Gilchrist, as a person who has contributed mightily to the Australian poultry industry and to knowledge on avian diseases, and would be the most widely recognised authority on poultry diseases in New South Wales. He has recently written papers called `Newcastle disease is a threat to native birds' and `Further comment&mdash;response to the AQIS position'. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Researches (1985) reported 100% cent mortality in Eastern Rosellas within six (6) days of artificial exposure to Newcastle Disease.'</PARA>
<PARA>He also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Researches (1989) tested 1,235 Australian birds of 130 species for Newcastle Disease virus and antibodies and none gave a positive response. This tends to confirm the lack of exposure of and thus probable susceptibility of our native birds.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from Dr Paul Gilchrist. If we set the poultry industry to one side and go to the scientific evidence, we can see that AQIS has been derelict in chasing hard scientific evidence. We have two eminent world authorities, both Australians, saying there is a real risk to Australian native bird life here, and we have AQIS continuing to pursue the line with the minister&mdash;and with the Australian parliament&mdash;that there is an acceptable risk to bringing poultry meat into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to raise serious doubts about whether or not we are pursuing a proper course here. I would like to see a full inquiry as to the advice provided by AQIS and the thoroughness of its investigations in all of these matters. I would like to see a detailed analysis of how AQIS arrives at what is an `acceptable risk', because it seems to me that a 10 to one bet on whether or not there is going to be an outbreak is not an acceptable risk. I would like to see it be more like a 100 to one risk factor if we were even going to contemplate this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to what I think is the nub of the whole situation, which is Australia's comparative advantage over the rest of the world. We have, at close quarters, some very active and highly productive countries. We live in a fiercely competitive world, in terms of agricultural products. If we are not going to defend the comparative advantage we have with clean food products, then we ought to pack up the Australian primary industries right now, because it is a philosophy that one cannot apply to one industry and not to another. It is no good for the beef growers of Australia to say that we could do without some elements of the poultry industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the argument runs, an acceptable risk is if there is a small economic advantage. I have illustrated the small economic advantage to the consumers of Australia. With $3 million a year spread over hundreds of millions of pieces of poultry consumed by Australians in a year, the advantage for the individual consumer is infinitesimal. If you said to the average Aussie, `I would like you to pay 25c more a bird to make sure that we do not import disease, and our guarantee is that we are not going to let Newcastle disease into the Australian parrot population,' the kids of Australia would rise up in their schools and say, `We will pay 25c to make sure that Australia remains disease free.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a protectionist issue. The degree to which this argument on protection has gone on based on animal diseases is stupid, because we are running a risk of denying ourselves the comparative advantage that we have in an intensely competitive world trade in animal and agricultural products. Unless we stay with some semblance of being disease free and can sell without fear or favour around the world Australian products which are known to be disease free, then we will become like the rest of the world and, despite the economies of production, the tyranny of distance will kill our producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this in what I know is basically a beef debate. But I do so because I am really concerned about the direction I see the protection of Australian animals, flocks and vegetable products going. Our crops are also facing the same sort of threat. I will wait with great interest to hear from the minister the assertions and support that he cannot give in his correspondence, because he does say in the last few lines of his correspondence that there is no guarantee. He says that AQIS cannot give a guarantee that Australian flocks would be free of Newcastle disease. I think this is a terrible decision. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will address my remarks mainly to the meat industry and I would like to raise the simple question: how are these new proposals being put forward by the government really going to tackle the central problems facing the meat industry today? This is what ought to be concerning all honourable members and it seems to me that it is the one area that the government seems to have skirted around. In fact, one would have to say that we could judge them as being a failure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have to go any further than the Industry Commission report on meat processing released in July last year, which was quite a while ago when you think about it. The government has had all this time to address some of the core problems. Instead of doing that, we are now going off onto another tangent, changing a lot of the structures around the meat industry but, at the same time, avoiding the primary problem. In the overview of the Industry Commission report, which has a very informative way of putting the problems in perspective, it says in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australia produces livestock at very low cost by international standards. However, efficient processing is necessary if we are to take full advantage of our comparative advantage in livestock production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although Australian meat is generally price competitive on export markets, this is largely because processors are able to buy livestock at very low prices compared with processors in other countries.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that puts it in a very stark perspective. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This inquiry has found that, despite some recent improvements, Australia's meat processing industry operates at significantly higher cost than processing industries of most countries with which it competes. It has also found that Australian meat exports have been losing market share in almost all our major export markets.</PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest to all honourable members that there are two very strong messages there. One is the fact that our processing costs are higher than those of our competitors, which is only compensated for by the fact that livestock producers are being paid less. The other more chilling fact is that we are losing market share in almost all our major export markets. I would have thought that the alarm bells would be going off. I find it most disconcerting to listen to some of the government members who seem to be completely avoiding this point and are not able to come to grips with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is even more galling about this is to listen to the comments that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made which were reported by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), in his address. He said that, when asked a question about the problems of the high processing costs, the Prime Minister said, `Aren't you a mug for highlighting the inefficiency of the Australian beef producer.' The Prime Minister obviously completely misunderstood the industry; he had no idea. I would have thought that that same description could be applied to many of the contributions by government members to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I leave the Industry Commission report, I want to look very closely at the point that was made in the overview which seems to have escaped government members completely. They come in here like robots and suggest that members of the coalition are just knocking the workers and all they want to do is get lower wages. Talk about ignorant! They obviously have not even read the report. If we look at page 16 of the overview, we will find some comments about the industrial relations problems which really are the core issue in this whole question of trying to get a more efficient meat processing industry. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry has been disadvantaged by a poor industrial relations climate and a poor occupational health and safety record.</PARA>
<PARA>Remember, we are talking about an industry that has had this problem for many years, but, equally, we are talking about a government that has been in power for 12 years and has done mighty little to address the problem. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Features of the industry's award system inhibit innovation and have contributed to industrial unrest. Seniority systems and daily hire provide insufficient incentives for training and skills development. The complexity of the tally system, and its structure of premium rates of remuneration for extra output, reduces incentives for improving working conditions and productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capacity utilisation of the Australian industry is lower than that of our competitors, resulting in higher fixed costs per unit of output.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission has found&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the important point&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that greater flexibility&mdash;particularly greater use of enterprise agreements&mdash;could bring about significant productivity gains, with benefits&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise this point&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for workers, producers, processors and some consumers.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, the government members were unable to get this far into the report to see that what is being proposed by the Industry Commission&mdash;the core issue&mdash;is actually going to be for the benefit of the workers, not to their disadvantage, as people like the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) tried to claim when they came in and made their contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems extraordinary that it has taken report after report to highlight what has been so obvious to so many in the industry who have understood what has been going on for some years. Australia is the net loser because of the government's failure to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a package of bills which does not address that core issue but does a number of other things such as increase the minister's power over the structures to run the industry. It fails to address some of the major problems with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, as my colleague the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) was discussing in his contribution, and it still does not address the primary problem of how we make the meat industry more competitive on an international scale. I guess that, as usual, the government wants to be seen to be doing something, rather than getting in and tackling the central points. If we look at one of the claims in these bills themselves, apart from the fact those opposite do not address some of these core issues, there is a claim that there is no cost in introducing these changes to the AMLC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I think anyone would know, if significant changes are made to the structures that are operating, it is likely to cause quite a lot of dislocation and there will be some costs, not only directly but indirectly, as people try to adjust to those changes. Clearly, they will have some difficulty in focusing on some of the core issues as they make those adjustments. If we take the question of market information, there is no explanation there as to whether or not the quality or, indeed, the quantity of market information is going to be improved by this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second point is about the question of a minister increasing his power in the whole issue. He has now been given two very key powers: he can veto or, indeed, vary the corporate plans of the Meat Industry Council, the Meat and Livestock Corporation or the Meat Research Corporation. So that is very significant power&mdash;a power not only to veto but also to vary. He can have a very big degree of influence and involvement through the guidelines, approvals and appointments of key people on the boards of the various bodies. This is fraught with danger. There is a very real risk that, if a minister wanted to abuse that position, he could do enormous danger to this industry by appointing his cronies or people who are not competent to do the job to the best of their ability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I flag this concern because I think it is something that the government ought to be held accountable for. Clearly, by vesting so much power in a minister, there is a very real risk that the industry could suffer. We only have to look at the last two ministers for primary industry to see some of the shortcomings that I am referring to. When it comes to the meat industry, we have had a choice between two ministers&mdash;the current minister who seems to know nothing about the industry, and the previous minister who really did nothing. That is the choice we have had with this current government: the know-nothing or the do-nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now come to my third point, which concerns the whole question of AQIS, the Quarantine and Inspection Service. Again, if we look at the Industry Commission's report, we find that it suggests that AQIS should be split into two. We clearly need more competitiveness in the whole question of meat inspection. I do not think it is good enough to continue to have a complete monopoly, as AQIS currently has. I think it is worth also reminding honourable members that meat inspection is a most expensive&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, one of the areas that does require some attention, as the Industry Commission report has pointed out, is the whole question of inspection services. Meat inspection in Australia costs producers around $90 million a year. That is not an insignificant sum, especially when you look at what some of our competitors pay. For example, in the United States, they pay nothing; meat inspection is provided by the government. One of the other points that is long overdue for recognition is the need to change our inspection system. As I said, this should involve not only splitting AQIS into two, but also looking at a system similar to the HACCP, the hazard analysis critical control point system, on the whole of meat inspection. One of the concerns is that, at the moment, we basically rely on end-point inspection which really only allows a quick glance at the appearance of the meat and clearly could easily overlook some of the possible problems that the whole inspection service is designed to avoid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's consumers require more than just a visual inspection. They want the microbiological tests. They want to make sure that the product is clean and that problems that are undetectable to the eye have, in fact, been avoided. Clearly, if we are going to do that, all stages of the processing chain, from the time of transport and from production itself, have to be looked at and what we might call a quality assurance system has to be instituted. This would not only guarantee a safer product but would also, I think, guarantee a better product. That is the whole point of this HACCP system because it eliminates this risk. Therefore I think it is time that we started to look at this, instead of the government continuing with the existing system which clearly has some shortcomings. This would dovetail very nicely into some of the work that the Cattle Council has been doing in developing its quality assurance program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point, and probably the most significant one, is the whole question of industrial relations. As has been shown in the Industry Commission report&mdash;and was, in fact, shown in the Booz Allen and Hamilton report a couple of years ago&mdash;we do have a major problem in the cost of processing in Australia. That is why we are in the alarming position where not only are Australian processing costs much higher and Australian producers are receiving less than their counterparts in other countries but, at the same time, we are losing market share in many of our export markets. Part of the industrial relations problem that has been highlighted also adds to the fact that our processing costs are, in many cases, double that of the New Zealanders and more than twice what it costs to process in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look at other parts of the chain, for example, the whole waterfront system. We have seen $430 million spent there, half of it provided by taxpayers, yet if we look at the latest Contship assessment, the performance of Australian ports is slipping back down the list. So all that money has been spent only to see that our performance is deteriorating when it is compared with that of other ports around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have highlighted the industrial relations problem as it affects the meat industry in the processing area. I have mentioned the problems in the waterfront. We could also look at some of the inefficiencies in transport. But I come back to the point I made that was highlighted in the Industry Commission report: it is not a question, as some of the honourable members opposite have tried to portray it, of trying to force workers into poorer conditions or lower wages. It is quite the opposite. It is by increasing the productivity and by getting greater efficiency that, in fact, everyone can benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tragedy for this industry and the country that Australian meat processors and producers have to pay a very high price for a system which all commentators in this country have recognised is inefficient. Only the Labor Party seems unable to realise that we are putting a major impediment in the way of improving our export performance in this industry and, indeed, in just about every other industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Producers are the ones who are suffering. It has been estimated that the average cattle producer in Australia is getting from $50 to $100 per head less than they would be getting if Australia had a world competitive system for processing and transporting products. This was illustrated very clearly by a recent example when Queensland, ostensibly because of the drought problem, found itself in a position where it had to import beef from United States and New Zealand. After paying all the costs of shipping that meat to Australia&mdash;and cattle producers in the United States are paid far more than the Australian producers&mdash;the beef could still be landed in Queensland at a competitive price compared with the Australian product. More clearly than anything else, that illustrates what a dreadful problem we have and, as I see it, the legislation does virtually nothing to address it. It is a forerunner to some of the other problems that the industry is going to face if we do not get efficiency into the whole process. Already it is clear that parts of South America are going to be able to send their meat into the United States and we will find that that will be very competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out one issue which I think the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) has made a lot of noise about, that is, the importance of getting women involved in some of these associated boards. Everyone would agree with the thrust of that, but, when he talks about having quotas, it raises some concerns. Looking at government appointments to date, it is very hard to find people other than men. The most recent appointment, which only reinforces this point, has been to the position of chairman of the Meat and Livestock Corporation. It was none other than the former minister for primary industry, Mr Kerin. The government representative on the Meat Industry Council is a man, the government representative on the ILC is a man, and the Meat Research Council is headed up by a man. Most of these people are very competent, but I do not think the government's record is followed up by its rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to raise these concerns again because one of our major primary industries is being sorely hampered by the fact that the government has failed to address the key issue of getting efficiency into the whole process. The Industry Commission report highlighted the core problem of getting efficiency into processing and boils the problem down to the government being rusted onto an archaic industrial relations system while the rest of the world looks on in utter amazement. Clearly, the government has failed miserably to serve the best interests of our industry and to serve the best interests of Australia in addressing this problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of bills will have a profound effect on the beef industry in Australia. These are landmark pieces of legislation, very important, and I want to reiterate a few points that have been made by the opposition during this debate. The first point is that it needs to be highlighted that it has taken the government 14 months to respond to this Industry Commission report. This is not just a one-off situation as far as government responding to IC reports is concerned. The taxpayers of Australia put an enormous amount of resource into getting these professionally done and objective reports of industry analysis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment we are also waiting on a report that is with a government minister and has been for 12 months&mdash;that is, the IC report on the petroleum industry in Australia. There has still been no response from the government in that regard, yet that also has an effect on this industry. It has taken 14 months for the government to respond to this Industry Commission report. I suppose that, if we look at some of the comments and recommendations that have been made in the IC report, we can understand why it has taken the government so long to respond to the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beef industry is one of Australia's most vitally important rural industries. We are very much world competitive, for reasons differing from those that the government recognises. Previous opposition speakers have passed criticism of the fact that this bill is being debated in the national parliament of Australia when the minister is overseas. We are not criticising the fact that the minister is overseas; we recognise that he has got to do that to do his job adequately in representing the rural industries of Australia. But it is probably an indication of where in the scale of the importance of things the government places the beef industry, when the government is prepared to run this legislation through in the second chamber when the minister is overseas. That needs to be put on the record. I know that there has been a fair amount of criticism levelled at the shadow minister for primary industry for making the same comments, but it is certainly worth putting it on the record that I think the government should have placed a little bit more importance on this package of legislation, which is very important to the prosperity of the beef industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package of legislation is complex. I was involved in the livestock selling business and auctioneering business in a former life, and so I can understand the frustration which many of my constituents have expressed to me with regard to recent levy charges and levy changes. It can be seen that the main bill is giving effect to the Meat Industry Council, and I understand that a great many of the other bills have the effect of transferring to the Meat Industry Council the ability to charge the levies which are already being paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see which organisations are to be on the Meat Industry Council, and, indeed, the details of the composition of the council jumped off the page at me when I first read it. There are to be 18 members and the council will include a chairperson and a government member, both of whom will be appointed by the minister. The minister will also appoint other members on the recommendation of the Cattle Council of Australia, the Sheepmeat Council of Australia, the Australian Meat Council, the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Livestock Exporters Association, the Australian Lot Feeders Association, the Australian Supermarket Institute Limited and other members prescribed by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it is not enunciated in any of the documentation that I have read in the course of my research, I would hope that, under that last criterion of `other members prescribed by regulation', there is a representative from the Livestock Agents Association. Livestock agents are the people who, on behalf of the AMLC, and, in the future, the Meat Industry Council, collect levies. They are the people who have got to deal with the producers and explain to them what it is all about when the levy goes up. Livestock agents also have to explain how the money is being spent. Although as the collectors for the Commonwealth the livestock agents cop the blame, I do not see them listed as members of that body. I have not researched the situation any further, and they may be involved as other members prescribed by regulation. I certainly hope so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate the absolute importance of having someone on the council who represents livestock selling agents from across Australia. There are a number of peak bodies in the states from which it would be possible to draw some very experienced people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not disagree with the selection of the other representatives on the council; their selection is obviously justifiable. However, although there are producers, processors, retailers and wholesalers represented on the council, the key conduit person from the middle of the process is not represented. It does not matter whether the product is consumed domestically or whether it is exported; the fact is that a large percentage of the beef cattle in Australia which are processed through saleyards are processed through livestock selling agents. It is very important that that fact is recognised, and I hope that the government takes what I have said on board. The government has obviously left a little flexibility at the margin so that someone else in that area can be included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Council of Trade Unions is included, and that is fine because many of the members of the union are involved in the beef industry in areas such as production and processing, transport, retailing and overseas shipment. However, do not forget a very important element: the livestock agents are the people who collect the levies for the Commonwealth in those circumstances. It is very important that livestock agents be included on the Meat Industry Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government asked the Industry Commission to undertake a study into the meat industry, and the commission reported to the government in July 1994. I have already made the point that the report had been with the government for 14 months before a response and this draft legislation was received. In its report, the Industry Commission pointed out that Australia produces livestock at a very low cost by international standards. However, efficient processing is necessary if Australia is to take full advantage of our comparative advantage in livestock production. The comparative advantage in livestock production in this country comes from the producers. It does not come from anywhere else along the chain; it comes from the producers. We have the most efficient producers of beef in the world and this is because the prices that our producers receive for their product are very low by world standards. The Industry Commission report said that the reason Australia remains world competitive in this area is that processors are able to buy livestock at very low prices compared with the prices paid by processors in other countries. I can confidently state that this is a fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of members on both sides of this chamber who have direct links to the beef industry in the production, wholesale or processing areas. The members concerned know that returns to beef producers have not progressed in real terms with the rest of the economy, and the members concerned all know that, in a lot of cases, returns have gone backwards. Returns are subject to the whims of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was recently borne out when US beef landed in Australia at competitive prices after cattle producers in the United States were paid 60 per cent more for their livestock than Australian farmers. There is not much room for any improvement as far as our primary producers are concerned. They are becoming world competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has signed the GATT agreement and the World Trade Organisation comes into effect from 1 July 1995. In those agreements, as far as the reduction of tariff and subsidy is concerned, particularly in regard to primary products, it is on a percentage basis across-the-board off different bases. The Australian Commonwealth and its producers were already receiving low subsidy and low tariff protection. Off that base, in the first year we are reducing our tariffs by 20 per cent, whereas Great Britain and countries in the European Union are reducing from enormously high levels of tariff protection in excess of 100 per cent. I just do not see how we are ever going to be really competitive in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European Union and the United States of America still do not seem to be committed to the moral ethic of the Uruguay Round. Recently, the US introduced extra subsidies on dairy products into South-East Asia. It is going to be interesting to see, when the time comes, what we will do and what the World Trade Organisation will do when the US does not comply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is doubly difficult for our primary producers. They are not supported in a genuine way by the rest of the industry as far as reform is concerned. Reform is not happening in a number of areas. In the processing sector, it is not happening adequately or quickly, nor is it happening in the government sector&mdash;for instance, AQIS and its services. All Australian processors have committed themselves to quality assurance programs. In my electorate, a couple of processing plants have gone the whole hog and spent an enormous amount of money on quality assurance. They have their own quality assurance people in place but the number of AQIS people has not been reduced. That is a burden in itself. It adds to the high cost of the end product that is not relevant to what the producer has to put up with. The government has not responded to a number of issues from the IC report. One of the documents I was researching was interesting. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there has been an extensive consultation process leading to the introduction of this package of Bills, a major reservation can be identified. This is that the process was conducted against the background of issues raised in the Industry Commission report and the Discussion Paper and these, almost exclusively, focussed on perceived deficiencies in current arrangements, and concerns over the effectiveness of AMLC programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, relatively scant attention appears to have been paid to those aspects of the present meat marketing system which are operating satisfactorily. Nor has there been any indication of the tangible benefits that presumably would flow from the package or of what, if any, the costs might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assertion that the proposed arrangements will provide a less regulatory operating environment for the industry is not yet supported by any evidence. While there has been a rearrangement of the roles and powers of various statutory bodies, in total the same array of objectives, functions and powers will largely endure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the proposed arrangements do not give industry a full self-determination role in policy and industry development because of two key powers vested in the Minister. These are the power to veto/vary MIC, AMLC and MRC . . . directives with respect to performance of MIC, AMLC and MRC functions and powers. The Minister will also have a degree of influence and involvement through the likes of guidelines and approvals (such as appointments and export licences).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It remains to be seen whether or not those who want the role of the AMLC phased down or out . . .  or those who wish to see statutory marketing and information continue . . . can be reconciled, particularly given the MIC's levy setting responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that there has to date been no commercial evaluation, or rigorous analysis of the worth of the AMLC and MRC to the meat and live-stock industry, it is possible that a minimally staffed MIC will not be able to mount well thought through proposals without the information base of the AMLC and MRC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian meat and live-stock industries have not reconciled the age-old conflict between producers and processors to the extent that has occurred in the dairy industry.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an absolute matter of fact. They have not been reconciled. There is not a whole of industry commitment to the outcomes that we want to see achieved in the beef industry, and that is so very true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wholeheartedly support the arrangements that have been in place under the Kerin plan and then the Crean plan. The opposition supported the arrangements that we have moved the dairy industry into, so that it can take on the agreements that we have signed concerning the World Trade Organisation, which comes into place on 1 July this year. But we have not got that whole of industry commitment by the beef industry. There are too many tensions, there is not the commitment to the outcome and there is not the fairness of the down-flow of benefit to the people that deserve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see the producers in times of drought receiving lower and lower margins. We see producers in good times, in flush times, being penalised because of corrupt overseas markets. When the market is bad, the people that bear the brunt of it are not the processing plants or the people that work in the processing plants, they are not the transport operators or the shipping people that take the containers over the wharves. Who are they? It is the producers that bear the brunt of it. Instead of getting $400 for a beast, they get $200 for a beast and have got to shut up and take it. They have absolutely no redress at all because those producers might have one sale a year. They might breed weaners for sale into a fattening market, and they have one sale a year. If that sale happens to fall in a time of low prices, they have no choice but to take what they are offered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That illustrates that there is no commitment right across the industry to see fair and equitable distribution of the profits of the industry back to the people who produce the goods and the other people involved in the industry who have got major investment. Without the producers, without the processors, the employees along the way would not have the jobs that they have got. It is very important that in the industry, and at this level of setting industry policy, these facts are recognised. To date I do not believe they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the amendment that has been moved by the shadow minister. I will put it on the record again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the Main Committee deplores the fact that the Government has implemented only one of the Industry Commission's recommendations for the industry and has ignored the others, including important recommendations relating to industrial relations reform and the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service".</PARA>
<PARA>I have covered both those points in my address this afternoon and I go back to the other main points that I started with as far as this vitally important industry is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has taken all that time for the government to respond, in drafting this legislation, to that IC report; the government has addressed only a couple of the recommendations in that IC report; and it is running this legislation through the national parliament of Australia with the minister overseas. I am not decrying the fact that he is actually overseas working on behalf of the producers of Australia. I am just pointing out that the scheduling of this legislation when he is not here is an indication to us on this side of the House of the level of importance that the government places on this industry, which is absolutely vital. We are not seeing a genuine attitude towards all the government members' constituents that work in this industry, to try to see the ongoing viability of the industry and to see a fair and equitable distribution of the profits that flow from this industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most important is the fact that, in all the documentation that I have read, there does not seem to be any reference to the possibility of having a representative of any of the livestock agents associations around Australian represented on the Meat Industry Council. They are an absolutely vital link in the chain in this industry in Australia. They are the people who actually collect all the levies that this legislation is putting into place, for the Meat Industry Council to collect. They are the people with whom the bureaucrats in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy should be liaising. They should be told, `This is how you explain it to the producers. This is what we were are doing with the money. It is all about making sure that our product maintains a very high reputation overseas.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all agree with that sentiment. We agree with what has been done. The producers do not know that; that message is not getting across. The message is not getting down to those livestock agents. I implore the government to have a look at that particular area under the category `other members prescribed by regulation' so that there is some representative of the livestock agents to give them input into what is going to be a very important body in the future. </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on jet aircraft landings at airports where noise amelioration programs are being funded by the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will be aware that construction of a new parallel runway at Sydney airport was completed during 1994, and the runway came into operation in November 1994. When the recently installed air traffic control system is operating at full capacity, the traffic handling capacity of the new runway configuration will be about 80 aircraft movements per hour, compared with 55 movements per hour prior to the commissioning of the new runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the operation of the new parallel runway configuration significantly reduces the overall number of people seriously affected by aircraft noise, particularly among those to the east and west of the airport, it significantly increases the level of noise exposure for residents of some other areas, mainly to the north of the airport. Recognising that this would be the case, the government, in 1991, commissioned a steering committee, convened by the Federal Airports Corporation, to prepare a noise management plan for Sydney airport, identifying possible measures to mitigate the noise impact of the new runway operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A draft noise management plan was subsequently developed, with extensive involvement by the three levels of government, the community and the airline industry. The draft plan was released for public comment in June 1994. After considering measures proposed in the draft noise management plan, the government announced late last year that it would undertake a major program of acquisition and acoustic insulation of certain buildings in the areas worst affected by noise from the operation of the airport. In addition, the government has initiated a range of other measures, including mandatory flight paths, take-off procedures for jet aircraft and tighter curfew arrangements, to minimise the number of people affected by aircraft noise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The acquisition and insulation program encompasses the voluntary acquisition of up to 113 residential properties within the 40 ANEF zone; sound insulation of some 4,200 residential properties within the 30 ANEF zone; and sound insulation of schools and colleges, child-care facilities, hospitals and health care facilities and churches within the 25 ANEF zone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scope of eligibility for this program is at least equal to that at any major overseas airport where a noise amelioration program is in place. It is the government's intention that the announced program be completed within a three-year period. This, again, compares favourably with the rate of implementation of overseas programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on indicative cost data developed in conjunction with the draft noise management plan, the cost of the program was originally estimated at some $183 million. Following a reassessment of eligible buildings and the scope and cost of required works, the estimated overall cost of the program is now $260 million, in 1995-96 prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The airlines and their passengers will be the beneficiaries of the increased runway capacity created at Sydney airport. It follows that they should be required to meet the cost of reducing the noise impacts on the affected communities in the vicinity of the airport. The levy which this bill seeks to impose will provide the means for giving effect to this principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that the levy will apply only at declared airports, which are those where the following conditions apply:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. there are residences or public buildings in noise affected areas (as defined by ANEF contours) around the airport,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. there is or has been a federal government funded airport noise amelioration program in place, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the amount of levy collected at a given time is not in excess of the costs to the federal government of the noise amelioration program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy will apply, in the first instance, to Sydney airport only. This recognises the very significant change in noise patterns around the airport which results from the opening of the new runway. The government similarly expects that, where new runway developments or extensions enabling a significant change in either the number or type of jet aircraft usages occur at other major airports, the need for noise amelioration programs will also arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will be aware that the government has embarked on a program of leasing federal airports. As part of the next stage of the disposal process, the government will examine how best to ensure responsible environmental behaviour by users and operators of leased airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prospective airport operators will clearly have an interest in the development of environmental management measures, including noise amelioration, which may be warranted by significant runway works and changes in operations at the airports which they will be leasing. These leases will, therefore, be addressed in the context of the airport leasing program which will see the first of our major federal airports leased in 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the levy itself, the amount of levy payable per jet aircraft landing will be determined according to a formula developed as part of the Sydney airport draft noise management plan. The formula provides that the noisier an aircraft the higher will be the rate of levy payable per landing. For example, the amount of levy payable for a landing by a Boeing 747 will be some three to four times higher than for a Boeing 737, depending on the specific noise characteristics of the particular aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the levy to apply to landings by jet aircraft only. This reflects the fact that generally jet aircraft create greater noise disturbance than propeller driven aircraft. There will be some quiet small jet aircraft which are not liable for the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a requirement of the bill that revenue from the levy at a particular declared airport not exceed the cost of the noise amelioration program at that airport. To spread the cost impact on airlines, it is not envisaged that the levy will necessarily be raised at a rate which keeps pace with spending on the noise amelioration program. The levy rate will be prescribed by regulations subject to the limitations established in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed that there will be automatic annual adjustments of the levy rates in line with consumer price index movements. The rate will also be periodically reviewed in the light of other parameters, such as growth rates in jet aircraft landings and the cost of noise amelioration programs that might be established at any other airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's intention that the rate of levy be initially set at an amount of $155 per noise unit. This rate will be adjusted as necessary so as to enable the cost of the Sydney airport noise amelioration program to be recovered over a period of up to 10 years. In 1995-96 it is expected that the levy will raise some $32.2 million. This translates to an average cost per jet aircraft passenger landing at Sydney airport of around $3.40. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a landmark bill. It establishes a regime for recovering from aviation operators the costs of redressing the adverse impact of aircraft noise imposed on communities in the vicinity of airports, immediately in the case of Sydney airport and at other Australian airports in future years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Bill, the purpose of this bill is to establish a collection regime for the levy imposed by the complementary Aircraft Noise Levy Bill. The levy collection bill specifies in detail by whom, in what circumstances, and when and how the levy is payable. It also covers penalty and enforcement arrangements and provides the necessary powers to allow the levy to be collected by a Commonwealth authority. It is proposed that the Civil Aviation Authority, or Airservices Australia when it is established, will perform this role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the processes for collection of the noise levy readily dovetail with the authority's own revenue collection activities based on aircraft landings, it is expected that this arrangement will minimise administrative costs associated with the collection of the levy. I commend both bills to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, this House condemns the Government for its callous and incompetent policy on Sydney Airport, and condemns it in particular:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)for its decision effectively to close the east west runway;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)for misleading the people of Sydney about the noise that would be associated with the opening of the parallel runway; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)for its failure to develop adequate noise management measures prior to the opening of the parallel runway, rather than after it opened in a belated response to community pressure".</PARA>
<PARA>I rise on behalf of Senator Parer&mdash;who is our shadow minister for aviation and who has responsibility for carriage of this bill through the Senate&mdash;and, indeed, on behalf of the opposition generally. I take this opportunity to move my first amendment; I will be moving a second amendment relating to the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill at a later time, when we deal with the bill in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment probably bests expresses the views held by many people in Sydney today about the disaster that has been over their heads every day of the year since the opening of the third runway&mdash;or the second parallel runway&mdash;at Sydney's Mascot airport. I do not think there is a soul living in Sydney&mdash;nor, indeed, in New South Wales&mdash;who would not be affected by the concerns which these people in Sydney have been drawing to our attention as a consequence of the dramatic increase in noise over the heads of many thousands of people in Sydney since the second parallel runway was opened in the latter months of last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen on television, right across the nation, demonstrations being lead by community leaders in Sydney&mdash;demonstrations complaining about the poor management of aircraft noise as a consequence of the opening of the second parallel runway, and demonstrations about the lies and deceit concerning the effects of the opening of the second parallel runway that have been given to the people of Sydney by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is amazing to think that it was not until after the second parallel runway was opened by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) late last year that people became aware of the noise patterns that were to be created by the opening of that new runway and the effect that those noise patterns would have on the lives of Sydneysiders. People were not properly informed about the amount of noise and the places that that noise would impact upon throughout Sydney. As a consequence, some hundreds of thousands of people are adversely affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the government drags out a figure of around 110,000 or 120,000 people affected by the second parallel runway. But figures have been put to me in recent days that indicate that some 600,000 people have been adversely affected by the second parallel runway's being opened late last year. I do not live in Sydney, but I live in a regional area outside of Sydney. I have relatives and friends who live in Sydney. When I go there, it is the topic of conversation that those people first raise with me. It is absolutely amazing to evaluate the impact that this has had on the lives of ordinary citizens living in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that outrages them more than anything else is the fact that the people of Sydney were not adequately informed about the impact that this noise would have on them and the areas that this noise would impact upon. They believe&mdash;and we, in the opposition, agree with them&mdash;that they were lied to and were not provided with adequate information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there would be many people, not just on this side of the House but also on the other side of the House, who would agree that the proper information that should have been provided by the government was not provided to people in Sydney. It is for that reason that so many people are upset&mdash;upset because they were not properly informed but were lied to, and upset because for the first time in their lives they now have aircraft noise right over their heads, at levels that nobody had ever envisaged. It is for that reason that we have seen those demonstrations, which continue to this day and, I dare say, will continue beyond today despite the passage of this legislation through our parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why I suspect there will be further demonstrations is exhibited on the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, which publishes a very timely leak to the newspaper detailing the government's proposals to further expand Sydney airport. That will ultimately increase the operations at Sydney airport and ultimately increase the noise over the heads of people living in Sydney. This will further fire up demonstrations of concern by people in Sydney because yet again the government, through the Federal Airports Corporation and, indeed, the Civil Aviation Authority, is not telling the people of Sydney the truth about the second parallel runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I speak about not telling the truth about the second parallel runway, I might make the point also that the government is not telling the truth about its decision to close the east-west runway. Sydney has had a north-south, east-west runway operation at Mascot airport for as long as people can remember. The east-west runway was closed with the opening of the second parallel runway late last year. One of the reasons people are so upset is that, with the closure of the east-west runway, people who have bought their houses and lived their lives with the expectation that they will have aircraft noise over their heads and have paid a price&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it was a deal, and it was struck for political purposes for political gain. The people of Sydney know this. It has even been reported in a book. I do not need to mention any names because it has become folklore in parts of Sydney as to the reasons for this. It has been put by the government, and by the minister in particular, that, in addition to those reasons outlined by the honourable member for Watson, the closure is for safety reasons. It is said that we cannot have an intersecting runway operation at Sydney airport now that we have a second parallel runway. That is pure bunkum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have lived with intersecting runway operations at Sydney airport for as long as anybody can remember. Major airports around the world, bigger than Sydney's Mascot airport, some of the biggest airports in the world&mdash;indeed, the biggest airport in the world&mdash;have intersecting runway operations as part of their normal runway operations. They manage to operate those safely, efficiently and effectively. The net consequence of closing the east-west runway has concentrated a great deal of noise over a substantial part of Sydney that never expected it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why people are fired up in Sydney. That is why they are arguing against the government. That is why they are making accusations that the government did not inform them adequately. That is why they are having demonstrations. As I was saying a moment ago, I expect that there will be more demonstrations because a report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> says that there are plans to expand the Mascot operations through the addition of a number of buildings to increase the capacity of Mascot airport in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not told us much about that, just as it has not told us much about the new control tower at Mascot airport. The new control tower was supposed to open before the New South Wales election. It was conveniently delayed until Easter. Due to some technical failure, which we have become used to when talking about operations managed by the Civil Aviation Authority, the control tower is still not in operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Buck Brooksbank, the acting chief executive officer of the Civil Aviation Authority, says that nobody can give a date for when the control tower will be in operation and therefore able to alleviate some of the problems that we have been told it will alleviate. So Sydneysiders will have to live with these problems for longer than they were told they would prior to the New South Wales election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Sydneysiders will be living with these problems for longer than this government is prepared to admit, because this government is relying heavily upon its so-called fast-tracking of the Badgerys Creek airport&mdash;the Sydney West airport, as it is called. The government says, `Do not worry, we'll solve these problems for you. Vote for us at the next election because we have got the formula to reduce the noise over Sydney by fast-tracking the construction of Badgerys Creek airport.' The only thing that is fast about Badgerys Creek airport is the talk. We are getting a lot of fast talking from the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and a lot of slow tracking on Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Years after this government promised that Badgerys Creek airport would be opened, we still have not seen anything happen out at Badgerys Creek. There has been a steady march of transport ministers since this government came into office in 1983. Over that time, various transport ministers or ministers for aviation have made specific predictions about the completion of Sydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek. The last minister before the current minister, Senator Bob Collins, made a specific commitment as to the completion date of Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. That date passed by long ago. Yet this government, the present minister and the Prime Minister are asking the people of Sydney to believe their current speculations about the opening of Sydney West airport within the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of its track record on Badgerys Creek airport, the government cannot be believed. I believe the only thing that is happening at Sydney West airport is some fast talking and not much action. We are going to find that the people of Sydney will be bothered by these noise problems for a lot longer than the government is prepared to admit. My colleague Senator Parer provided me with some information that was revealed by the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority in its report on aircraft noise. The Environment Protection Authority concluded that many suburbs, including Kurnell, Bundeena and Rozelle, were experiencing annoyingly high levels of aircraft noise, despite the claim in the noise management plan that they would not be affected. In one street the noise level exceeded 80 decibels 26 times an hour and the residents living in that street do not qualify for the insulation program, despite the Australian standard that noise levels in homes should not exceed 60 decibels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That points to the fact that the bill does not deal adequately with the problems of noise for many thousands of Sydneysiders. Even for those Sydneysiders who do qualify for soundproofing of their buildings, schools and homes, this will not resolve all the problems. There have been some 3,000 submissions to the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney. Many of the submissions, which were made by 3,000 residents, are very sceptical about the soundproofing program. For example, one of them said that the recommendation to soundproof buildings and schools is only a partial solution, and that Sydney's mild climate lends itself to outdoor living. What happens when people or children move outside? Do they have insulated space helmets?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not going to completely solve the problem of aircraft noise for Sydneysiders. At best, it will only partially solve the problem for some of the people who are affected by noise levels from Sydney airport and as a consequence of the second parallel runway being open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank my colleague the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) for pointing out to me the other day that there are some rather unusual discrepancies in the way in which the levy for particular aircraft is going to work. He makes the point that the levy actually penalises the quietest jets at the expense of not penalising the noisiest jets as much. For example, a BAe146 will have a levy that is the equivalent of $5.17 per passenger, whereas a 747-400 will have a levy of $3.67 per passenger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody who knows anything about aircraft will tell people that a BAe146 is probably the quietest commercial jet aircraft operating in and out of Sydney at the present time. If I were a resident of Sydney concerned about noise levels, I would want to ensure that the government was doing its utmost to encourage the use of the quietest possible aircraft, given that Sydney airport is going to be a reality for many years. Indeed, the levy on the quietest jet aircraft, that is, the BAe146, is the highest of all the jet passenger aircraft that operate into Sydney's airport. </PARA>

As I say, if I were a resident of Sydney with aircraft roaring over my head, I would want to be encouraging the use of the BAe146 by having either no levy imposed or at least the lightest levy per passenger imposed on that type of aircraft rather than the opposite, which is the way the government has done it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill reflects the failure of the government to adequately manage the air traffic noise over Sydney airport. There has been very poor planning in the way in which the government has been developing its air traffic noise management proposals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many concerns raised by Sydneysiders, which are not adequately dealt with in this legislation. The government's propaganda about fast-tracking Badgerys Creek does not fool too many people. Its propaganda about narrowing the flight paths and introducing heavy penalties for those people who breach those flight paths is not going to solve the problem. People know that pilots go where they are told to go. Air traffic control tells the pilots to take a particular heading and to follow a particular track. The trumpeting by the minister, late last year and early this year, of his method of solving the aircraft noise problems over Sydney by having heavy fines for pilots who do not adhere to those flight paths, is going to do very little indeed to solve the problems of aircraft noise resulting from the expansion of Sydney's Mascot airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an issue of considerable concern. My colleague in the Senate Senator Parer, our shadow minister for aviation, will be making very strong representations in the Senate on this issue. I know other members in this House will also be making representations to try to do their best to bring some honesty and openness into the way in which this government deals with the people of Sydney over the aircraft noise problem. I can tell the House&mdash;as would the honourable member for Watson, who represents many people in Sydney&mdash;that this problem is destroying the lives of people in Sydney. The noise is incredible. I have actually been to some of these places, where the aircraft noise rattles the houses. My mother-in-law lives out in Castle Hill. That might seem a long way from Sydney's airport. Yet, for the first time ever, aircraft are flying over her house and destroying the lifestyle of the people living out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem is affecting a very wide area of Sydney, previously never affected by aircraft noise. The people in those areas have a just argument; they bought or built their houses on the basis that they were not under a flight path. They paid prices for their houses that reflected the fact that those parts of Sydney were supposed to be quiet areas. Consequently, the value of their homes has been reduced. All Sydney's federal parliamentary representatives have to be very pro-active on this issue. I hope that they will be. They certainly should be, if they are to represent the interests of their constituents to the best of their abilities . </PARA>

I can tell members now that a lot of people are very sceptical about the way in which this government has been approaching the whole issue of airports in Sydney and at Badgerys Creek and the whole issue of noise pollution over the heads of hundreds of thousands of Sydneysiders. </PARA>

That information is in the EIS that the FAC put forward. For people to say, `Now that it has been built you have to go and reopen the east-west runway for continuous traffic,' is a duplicitous joke that these people are trying to inflict on the people of Sydney. </PARA>

Indeed, it has since been revealed that the Liberals even hired a PR firm to run their campaign for them. This is one of the most scurrilous episodes in the operation of the Greiner-Fahey government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also said publicly that the people in the Federal Airports Corporation are a disgrace. They have lied to the public and misled the government. It is shown again today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that the FAC is not telling people what its plans are. There has been more duplicity and dishonesty by officials in relation to Sydney airport than in any other exercise in government in the 16 years I have been in this House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC had the hide to say at one stage that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) ought to let the FAC bid to buy Sydney airport when the airport is privatised.

Fortunately, the minister decided that he is not going to let that scam occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition now say, `It's terrible. It's shocking.' The opposition say that, even though the opposition is part of the problem but not part of the solution. It is a sick joke. After all, it is people like the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who, all of a sudden, has discovered aircraft noise. He says, `Isn't it terrible? Share the pain. Open the east-west runway.' Of course, when we talked about this earlier&mdash;when the proposal was that the government should build the parallel runway and when the government put forward the idea that Badgerys Creek ought to be developed quickly as an alternate airport to Sydney airport&mdash;the member for Bennelong and his constituents did not like it. This is because, when we look at the studies of where air travellers come from in Sydney, we find a great little concentration of air travellers in the electorate of Bennelong. Travellers from this area do not want to spend a bit of time travelling out to the western suburbs of Sydney to catch their aeroplanes, and they say, `Oh, it's inconvenient to have to do that.' I say to them that there is no point in their saying that it is inconvenient to travel that far, just as there is no point in their saying now how inconvenient it is that the poor old real estate prices have fallen and that it is inconvenient to have the planes flying over their heads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, these people are part of the problem, never part of the solution. What we are hearing now is something which is an unfortunate latter-day conversion on the road to Sydney or Badgerys Creek, depending upon how people want to look at it. If only the opposition&mdash;and, indeed, the government&mdash;had been able to look at this a bit more carefully. If only members of parliament from all parties had not just been belly-aching and whingeing about how terrible it was that they had to spend 10 minutes circling Sydney airport on Friday afternoon on the way home from parliament, and how awful it was and how we had to get this parallel runway up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were conned by the FAC that that was going to solve their problem, and they were conned by the airlines. One of the great little hypocritical stories in this is that now we hear the bleatings from Qantas, our so-called wonderful national carrier. These are the people who never did any planning for what they did at Sydney airport, and all they want to do now is belly-ache about how terrible it is that the previous Liberal government gave Ansett all the land leases and that they do not have anything there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet they have the hide to say that if the government had done some earlier planning about Badgerys Creek then we would not have the problem at Sydney airport. Qantas did not do all that much planning, either. Qantas has not got any land, and its management is in the paper today saying they might have a plan to move their maintenance facility to Brisbane or to Melbourne because the government did not do something. It is the stupidity of the Qantas management in getting into bed with the Federal Airports Corporation and with Ansett in saying the solution to Sydney's airport needs was at Sydney airport with the parallel runway, rather than looking at what happened everywhere else in the world. Everywhere else, there are big airports out on the city rim and smaller airports close to the city, like Kingsford Smith is in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of this is that the lives of tens of thousands of people in Sydney have been destroyed, and they have been destroyed by politicians on both sides of this House who were short-sighted. They have been destroyed, in particular, by the duplicity and the lying and the dishonesty of the Federal Airports Corporation, the government's own GBE, which allowed these things to happen and did not inform ministers or the public of what it was up to. Its program was always to build everything it possibly could at Sydney airport; and it was aided and abetted by the airlines, which said that the last thing they wanted to do was to move out to Badgerys Creek. </PARA>

All the other belly-aching MPs from both sides would come back here on Tuesday mornings and tell me, `We had to queue up at Sydney airport again on Friday night. Isn't it terrible?' Bad luck.

I am truly of the belief that, if the Federal Airports Corporation had been open and had not concealed the truth about the effect this would have on the people of Sydney, no government would ever have built this monstrosity.

Of course, you cannot believe all that you read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, but on some of these issues it has been right.

That aside, the opposition is not going to oppose the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995 and the Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Bill 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a great deal of sympathy with what the member for Watson said in terms of some of the information that was given out regarding the effects of the opening of that third runway. This is but a very small way of trying to amend that particular situation. I want to give the honourable member for Watson some advice so that he can go in with his minister now and start getting things right for Badgerys Creek. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a major airport being on the edge of town, which Sydney West will be. The secret to the success of that particular airport will be the infrastructure, and the provision of fast and rapid transport to get in and out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the major airports being developed now around the world. The Denver international airport, which opened a few months ago, is about 52 miles out of the city and it has plans for a high speed rail link. More importantly, I suggest that the honourable member for Watson have a look at Stansted Airport in the UK which is coming on stream as London's No. 3 airport. It is interesting in that Stansted is an identical distance from the middle of London as Badgerys Creek is from the middle of Sydney. With the British Rail link that operates there, it is possible to get from Stansted to Liverpool Street Station, in the heart of London, in 42 minutes. Now, that is not a bad trip. Quite often, especially in the morning periods, it is almost impossible to get from Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport to the centre of the city in 42 minutes. The secret to it is that infrastructure: it has got to be high speed and it has probably got to be high speed rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was almost going to use an expression which would be politically unacceptable when saying that we can talk a lot about the development of Sydney West airport but, until such time as we get the infrastructure in place, we are not going to maximise the potential of that particular airport. There is no doubt that with the development of traffic coming into Australia, and into Sydney in particular, there will be a need for two airports. The reality is that about 62 per cent of the total air traffic in and out of Australia is going to use Sydney either for arrival or departure. With the expansion of airline services to Australia, and with things such as the Olympic Games coming up, there is no doubt that we will require those two facilities. It must be done properly this time so that, hopefully, we will never again see the situation that has developed in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular legislation is very much about Sydney airport. We heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) say in his second reading speech today that we have to have declared airports before these formulae for noise alleviation come into play. I would like to inform the government that there are a number of airports that will have to be declared in a hurry. If we are to look at the noise problems around Australia, may I suggest that the officials responsible have a very quick look at the approach path to Coolangatta. I am sure the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) will be talking about that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to expose what has been happening in terms of Brisbane airport. What the honourable member for Watson was saying about government advisers is really quite interesting. There has been quite a lobby group on the south side of Brisbane for many years now who complained about aircraft noise when the new international airport in Brisbane opened in 1988. Seven years later there are still problems. As we see in this bill, there is a specific formula for determining what constitutes a badly noise affected area that would then allow people and institutions to take advantage of the bill. The magic figure is 60 decibels which, in technical terms, applies to 25 ANEFs. This particular group in Brisbane has been advised by Dr R.V. Dubs, the general manager of planning and development in the Civil Aviation Authority, that, as far as it is concerned, it would appear that Brisbane does not have these problems and that there are not any areas in the flight paths that would qualify for this sort of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that there have been a number of studies done on noise exposure distribution in Brisbane, and it is quite interesting when the facts come to light. I would like to quote, as a couple of examples, studies that were done in April and June of last year in two very badly affected areas&mdash;namely, around the Tingalpa school and also at Cannon Hill. I would want to place particular emphasis on Cannon Hill because it is proposed to develop the area there that once contained the Brisbane abattoir by building something like 12,000 new dwellings. The Queensland state government and the Brisbane City Council seem to be pretty anxious to have 12,000 new dwellings put on that particular space. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the interesting thing about that particular location at Cannon Hill is that a noise monitor has been put nearby. In a particular period, from April to June last year, some very interesting figures came through. During that period there were 3,037 aircraft movements in that region. Of these 3,037 aircraft movements, no fewer than 2,857 of them registered above the 70 decibel mark&mdash;between 70 and 90 decibels. If the Queensland government is going to proceed with that housing development of 12,000 new dwellings, somebody is going to have a problem in terms of providing the insulation and the noise reduction facilities there. About 61.5 per cent of the traffic at that time actually broke the legal limit and, of course, while that is referring particularly to that new development site, Cannon Hill is one of those areas which are badly affected by aircraft noise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second study was done at the Tingalpa state school, and bear in mind the CAA says that there are no areas that actually qualify for any of this assistance under its formula. In that period, from April to June last year, at the Tingalpa state school there were 4,249 movements of which 2,447 were registered as being above 70 decibels, or 56.5 per cent of the total. At this stage, this legislation is designed strictly for Sydney, but the reality has to be faced that places such as the south side of Brisbane have some real problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, one of the reasons that the CAA says that there are no problems in Brisbane is that aeroplanes are supposed to follow their designated flight paths. The official CAA map is really quite interesting because it shows where those aircraft should go. In fact, there is a noise monitoring facility at Princess Street in Morningside and another one at Tingalpa. There are some on the north side. But it is true that it is not uncommon for aeroplanes approaching Brisbane, especially from the north, to be two or three kilometres away from their designated flight paths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very area where I live it is quite interesting because the southerly flight path is a couple of kilometres away from my home and I have watched those aircraft approach. There is a flight path that comes in from New Zealand over the Redland Bay beacon and I can watch that. They are the designated flight paths, but an awful lot of aeroplanes fly straight over the top of our place. That does not particularly worry me. I quite enjoy it, actually. I set up my monitor and I listen to what is happening in the Brisbane tower. I can tell honourable members that a heck of a lot can be learned about the operation of the Civil Aviation Authority by monitoring some of those conversations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, in a personal sense, I have got no vested interest in this. But the reality is that these aeroplanes do stray from their official flight paths. In terms of that area on the south side of Brisbane&mdash;through Balmoral Heights and Cannon Hill and down through Tingalpa to the Seven Hills area&mdash;people have a real problem. The government has duckshoved this for a number of years, and has denied that there is a problem there. My estimate is that we will probably see nothing whatsoever done about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned Coolangatta, and there are other airports around Australia which have these problems. I hope some people are not going to get their hopes up too much when they read that this legislation is in play, because this legislation provides only for jet aircraft, yet there are many airports that receive incredible amounts of noise from non-jet aircraft. The people of Moorabbin and surrounding places are not going to get any benefit from this particular legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could look at Archerfield, in Brisbane. Any member on the south side of Brisbane will talk about the phone calls he gets&mdash;at 4 o'clock in the morning, at home&mdash;from the residents of Salisbury or Oxley because the propeller driven freighters are going over at 4 o'clock in the morning and blasting everybody out of their beds. Those people are not going to get any relief from this particular legislation, because we are only covering jet aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), I get a bit cynical about this, because the passengers who are going to be hit more than anybody else are the poor devils flying on the BAe146, one of the quietest aircraft in the skies. Are honourable members aware that we are so good that Australia is the only country in the world that has any curfew on the BAe146 whatsoever? Australia is the only country in the world that has any restrictions on this. The BAe146 happily flies around freight services during all hours of the day and night in Europe, with no restrictions whatsoever. But we come in here and we slam every passenger on the BAe146 $5.17 per head, on average. I really wonder.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there are supposed to be provisions here to ensure that there is going to be no major profit made by the authorities from this particular operation. But I really wonder why that BAe146 crept in here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I would have thought that they might have been given a bit more encouragement than, say, the Boeing 727, which is still operated by Ansett. When the honourable member for Watson and I started talking about aircraft noise in Sydney, the real argument, to a very great extent, has been about the fact that the 727 is still operating over some of those areas. It is a very rowdy aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two aircraft that probably cause more concern than most&mdash;they certainly do on the south side of Brisbane&mdash;are the Fokker F28 and the Boeing 727, which are old aircraft. The F28, apparently, is going out of service. Ansett was suggesting that we were going to see the demise of the 727 from its fleet late last year. There are now suggestions that the 727 could be flying well into the next century. Unless they are hush-kitted, we are going to have some enormous problems there. But the fact that the BAe146 has got the big slam really makes me quite amused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real worry is that this particular legislation is not going to cover a number of other people around Australia who have some real difficulties in terms of aircraft noise. I would hope that the government would prove to be quite genuine in providing for the people of Sydney, who have got their own specific problems, and genuine in terms of the people who live in the flight path of the Coolangatta airport or on the south side of Brisbane. I hope the government will be genuine for the people at Archerfield, Moorabbin or Bankstown, and make sure that all those who are badly affected by aircraft noise do get some sort of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, let us hope that there is some honesty, and that the officials who are responsible for these things do not try to duckshove some of the noise readings and some of the formulas that they use. Let us make sure they get out there amongst the real people who are experiencing these noises. Let us make sure they put their monitoring services underneath the actual flight paths instead of the theoretical flight paths, and let us try to get some justice for the great number of people who are being very deeply affected by aircraft noise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995 is for an act to impose a levy on the landing of jet aircraft at certain airports. At the moment, this policy is directed at Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. The purpose of this levy is to attempt to introduce some financially based discipline on the use of Sydney Kingsford Smith airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the residents of the inner city and certain northern suburbs of Sydney are sorely punished by the operations of this airport. The opening of the third runway has not proved to be an improvement. The situation is now worse and residents of my electorate and those of Sydney, Grayndler and Bennelong demand that this parliament do something definite to ameliorate their suffering. Hopefully, this levy will go some way towards controlling the noise and take-off pattern of jet aircraft into and out of KSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two bills to deal with on this matter&mdash;the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995 and the Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Bill 1995&mdash;and I will consider these together. In connection with these bills, I would also like to comment on the woeful situation that has brought about the requirement for this levy. Given the financial commitment, both public and private, and the current standards of the infrastructure at Sydney airport, it is patently obvious that this facility will remain in operation for many years to come. I think that the calls to close Sydney airport at this stage are wide of the mark. It is also clear, given the above premise, that aircraft operations will affect a substantial number of Sydney residents and these residents require, on health and public amenity grounds, the insulation of premises, reduction of engine noise and rigorous control of the flight paths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reducing the rate of growth at Sydney airport, the government has no option but to press ahead with a second airport at Sydney West. Our tourism industry cannot be curtailed. It is our biggest export earner and the Sydney Olympics is staring us in the face. Knowing this, the government has committed substantial funds to the new airport. The May 1995 federal budget contained a commitment to provide $610 million additional funding for the accelerated development of Sydney West airport by 1999. This budget allocation means a total funding commitment by the government of $762 million for the site development and infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is excellent news but, again, I emphasise that, as of today, no concrete has been poured so, although Sydney West airport will provide some solace in the years ahead to my constituents, what about the immediate future of the next four years? As for the suffering of residents due to the current operation of Sydney airport, I do acknowledge the decision of the federal government to approve $183.4 million over the next 10 years aimed at reducing the impact of aircraft noise on residents living around Sydney airport. This program was announced as costing $183.4 million in November 1994, as estimated by the FAC consultants. Following the extension of the coverage of the program and more detailed costings, the estimated costs have now increased by $76.6 million to $260 million. The major reasons for the increase in these costs estimated by the FAC consultants are: additional buildings identified for treatment within the previously announced categories and assistant areas; outcome of more detailed assessment of work required, particularly for air-conditioning, structural reinforcement and electrical work in schools and colleges; an upward movement in external noise levels to more clearly reflect the actual measured aircraft noise and resultant upwards adjustment in the level of sound treatment required; cost estimates for preliminary design documentation; and the project management not included in the earlier estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government announced the immediate commencement of the schools installation program with completion targeted for the end of the first term of this year but the state, Catholic and other school administrations have subsequently expressed a preference for a staged approach to noise treatment so that the schools experience minimum disruption to educational activities. The eligible schools in my electorate of Lowe are Drummoyne public school and St Marks Catholic school in Drummoyne. Child-care facilities will also eventually be eligible. These will include Drummoyne Occasional Child Care Centre, College Street Child Care Centre, Drummoyne municipal preschool and Drummoyne Baptist preschool. The following churches and other places of worship will also eventually be eligible: Drummoyne Baptist Church, Drummoyne Presbyterian Church, St Marks Catholic Church and Drummoyne Uniting Church. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The noise amelioration measures are useful and timely and I think that much attention must be given to this question of noise as it is a major health question. The bills before us today are stated to be for the purpose of financing this noise amelioration. The financial impact statement contained in the general outline of the bills says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rate of levy to be prescribed under the legislation will be designed to recover the costs associated with noise amelioration works currently under way in Sydney, with a target collection rate of $32.2 million in the 1995/96 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that this is true. My electors and the residents of Sydney would be very disappointed and angry if moneys raised by these bills were to disappear into consolidated revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not very happy to have to call into question the honesty of public officials. However, the saga of this airport and the third runway and all the associated matters have brought about a situation where a lot of Sydney residents simply do not believe the word of any official associated with this matter. This is a sad situation, but the facts of the matter do give grounds for deep suspicion. We must ensure that these bills do not end up increasing the duplicity surrounding this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go on speaking on the various clauses of the bill, I want to put on the record the serious health and social issues associated with noise. Aircraft noise above a certain level is a public health risk and, since the opening of the third runway, the New South Wales health department has been collecting data on the use of medical resources by residents affected by the aircraft noise. More than 70,000 people in Sydney now live within the high noise contour area. Overseas studies have conclusively shown that aircraft noise is a serious cause of illness and the noise raises the stress level for the very young and the very old. Medical investigations in Sydney show that areas affected by high aircraft noise have a higher degree of arteriosclerosis, nephritis and nephrosis, and heart disease. Local general practitioners report a serious rise in insomnia, anxiety, high blood pressure and nerve ailments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's preferred option in dealing with this problem is embodied in these bills. Frankly, I doubt whether fines will work effectively. I strongly suspect that the new community consultative committee, established by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and chaired by Joe Riordan, will have to work very hard to monitor these prosecutions carefully, as well as the respective fines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills levy a payment on some jet aircraft landing at some prescribed airports. At the moment, it covers Sydney airport, but it is to be expanded with ministerial approval. The levy will represent approximately $3.40 per passenger in a jet aircraft at Sydney airport and it is intended that the levy rate will be adjusted in line with consumer price index movements. The aim will be to recover the costs associated with the program over a period of not more than 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clauses 5 and 6 detail the method of calculation of the levy and stipulate that the levy shall be the same at all airports where a levy is charged. Because of the complexities of aircraft ownership&mdash;leaseholds, rentings, borrowings and all the other legal words surrounding possession and use&mdash;clause 4 of the levy collection bill boasts that it has a comprehensive definition of operator and thus identifies the person who must pay the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 6 of part 2 tells us about identifying those airports that qualify for the levy. Subclause (6) identifies the concept of ANEF. The ANEF system of noise measurement appears to be a questionable and easily manipulated one. It operates only in Australia and has been used extensively by the Civil Aviation Authority over the years. The CAA is now to be abolished by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 8 in part 3 leaves the question of actually paying the levy to be settled by regulation. I would suggest that the government not delay in issuing these regulations. I know that bureaucracy is large and deliberate and that it is invariably bad to rush things. However, I would again urge the bureaucracy and the ministry to be aware that the general public in Sydney is extremely distrustful of government in this area of civil aviation. This is a bad situation and my desire is to see the government adopt policies and regulations that actually address the aviation problems and help restore that level of trust and confidence that must exist between the people and their government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 of the levy collection bill deals with the power to gather information relevant to collecting the levy. This legislation is needed; I hope that it works. I have pointed out a few problems and perhaps I am wrong, but the bottom line is that swift and sure remedial action is needed to solve the noise problem at Sydney Kingsford Smith airport and to rapidly advance the construction of Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
