<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>It has become apparent that existing Commonwealth law does not adequately protect persons attending federal courts and tribunals. Currently police and other officers responsible for the safety of such persons do not have adequate protective powers to ensure a secure environment, particularly in circumstances where weapons and even explosive devices may be simply concealed in the clothing of a person, or in personal effects such as brief cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that it would be proper to provide legislative powers to assist Commonwealth courts to maintain security and protect the safety of both court staff and persons attending proceedings. Comparable legislation was enacted in Victoria in 1980 and in Queensland in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Commonwealth courts have an inherent jurisdiction to control and protect persons in relation to proceedings, the scope is uncertain. Police have, for example, been unclear about their powers to assist in the removal of persons from Family Court premises. What powers are available to search persons entering a court for weapons? The Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971 currently includes a statutory offence of refusing to leave Commonwealth premises without reasonable excuse when directed by a person with power to give such directions. This offence has limited application with respect to persons who are parties to court or tribunal proceedings&mdash;and who may have a `reasonable excuse' to disregard such an order&mdash;and it does not provide for associated security powers, such as searching for, and the detention of, firearms, explosive devices and offensive weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislative provisions are required to empower police and other authorised officials to take action in situations which raise a threat to the security of federal courts and tribunals. The amendments to the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971 propose a scheme of protective security consistent with the electronic screening undertaken at the entrance to Parliament House and at airports but also allowing for `frisk' searches, in the nature of a `pat down' search. Such screening is designed to identify security risks, while associated powers allow authorised officers to direct persons to leave the premises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possession of weapons in the court environment constitutes a serious threat to the ability of courts to function as a public forum. This is most apparent with respect to the Family Court. The sad history of violence directed at Family Court judges and those involved in such proceedings is a constant reminder that security is an issue that should be taken seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the legislation is the result of concerns emanating from events in the Family Court, the amendments can be applied to all federal courts or tribunals by regulation. The powers provided in the act will not be available to all federal courts and tribunals as a matter of course. Only such powers as are considered necessary by responsible officials having regard to the circumstances faced by a federal court or tribunal in a particular location will be available. This means that the identification and management of security requirements will be initiated by the court or tribunal itself. Regulations will be made only at the request of the court or tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The security powers provided in the legislation will be exercised by authorised officers. This term is defined to include police officers as well as persons who are authorised by the Attorney-General or by courts empowered to administer their own affairs. This provision addresses the concern that police will have to be solely responsible for the implementation of various separate security regimes at diverse premises. By providing for the authorisation of court or security officers, responsible specifically for the security of particular sites, the police can be utilised more flexibly to deal only with serious breaches of security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Powers held by police and authorised officers may include requiring a person attending prescribed premises to provide his or her name, address, evidence of identity and a reason for being on the premises. The legislation makes it clear that a wish to attend the proceedings of the court is an acceptable reason, and access will be available unless the person has not complied with the security arrangements in place at that court or tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is sensitive to criticism that exercise of the powers will discourage members of the public from attending court cases and thus undermine the principle that justice should be dispensed in public. I reiterate that the government is concerned to preserve the open and public administration of justice, whilst at the same time providing adequate protection to those participating in that administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been fortunate that violent attacks upon our judicial system have been few and far between. Unfortunately, apart from the well-known incidents involving the Family Court, there have been occasions at the state and territory level where people have been injured or killed in court buildings. Furthermore, recent tragic events in Oklahoma City remind us of the fragility and vulnerability of our open society. Governments have a responsibility to take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety and security of those involved in our judicial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulations will be made to govern the management of information gathered about persons attending court in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988. The government is aware that persons attending courts will be concerned about the possible uses of the information so gathered, and the regulations will address these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Authorised officers are empowered to search persons by using screening devices&mdash;for example, devices similar to those which are commonly used at airports&mdash;and/or by using a frisk search, conducted by quickly running hands over the outer clothing. It is envisaged that the use of screening equipment will be employed in most cases. Frisk searches will only be undertaken by persons of the same sex. Persons may also be required to deposit personal effects reasonably capable of concealing a firearm, explosive substance or offensive weapon. This power may be utilised, for example, where the goods in question cannot be adequately searched or where the security requirements of a particular court or tribunal do not warrant the installation of electronic screening mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although authorised officers are empowered to direct persons in breach of any requirement to leave the premises, enforcement of these requests can be made only by the police, in accordance with conditions set out in section 22 of the act. This promotes flexibility in the enforcement of security regulations at a basic level, by allowing courts themselves to determine appropriate security responses. It also ensures the involvement of the police in any potentially serious situation, where the person concerned refuses a lawful direction not to enter, or to leave, the premises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four new offences have been created to assist with the enforcement of the provisions. It will be an offence to refuse or fail to give information, or to give false information, in response to a lawful request; to refuse or fail, without reasonable excuse, to submit to a required search or to deposit certain personal effects with an authorised officer; to refuse or fail to comply with a direction to leave court premises; or to bring any firearm, explosive substance or offensive weapon into prescribed premises without lawful excuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity has also been taken to make a number of minor amendments, including updating the penalty provisions of the act. The removal of gender specific language and the updating of property valuations throughout the act have also been completed. It is hoped that the amendments will bring about a significant improvement in the provision of security services to Commonwealth courts and tribunals. With such measures in place, both staff and persons attending prescribed premises will be more confident of their safety. The amendments will have no significant financial impact. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Amendment Bill 1995 will not be opposed by the opposition. In fact, we will facilitate its prompt passage. My speech might even be mercifully short. That does not mean that the bill will go without some criticism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend this comment of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who delivered the speech, because I do not think it was written by him, rather for him, but it was a somewhat disingenuous speech. In that sense, I refer to the opening paragraph, where it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has become apparent that existing Commonwealth law does not adequately protect persons attending federal courts or tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA>To read those words you would sense that the government had only just hit upon this issue of concern. You would think that, at the least, it would have said that it has been `long apparent'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister comes from Sydney, as I do, and is very much aware, as I am, of the way in which the Family Court is targeted&mdash;some years ago, quite tragically, people I have known, some of them for most of my life, were affected by those tragic events. When you understand, as I have been informed, that the government has only just agreed to introduce these measures, although they were accepted some three years ago, you will see why I have offered the comments that I have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, as I understand it, has been long sought by the judges of the Family Court. While we are not stinting in our support of the proposed legislation we will not let it pass without the criticism that it has been left for so long. I do not apologise for that one iota. In fact, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) seems to want to devote his time to dealing with the more topical issues. He has a warped sense of priorities, as my colleague the shadow minister, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said when the Attorney-General talked about the televising of court proceedings as a priority for the justice system, picking up the more nightmarish approaches taken in the United States of America. Perhaps it is a response to the desire of those trying to promote pay television and who need some additional way of boosting their ratings and revenues that the minister thinks that sort of issue ought to be pressed as a priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply make the point that this legislation, which has been so long coming, is designed to ensure that federal courts and tribunals will be able to determine their own security requirements and take appropriate action to protect the judges and the public who are appearing before them or who are simply wanting to watch the application of justice in our federal courts and tribunals. The powers that will be given through this legislation will enable regulations to be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill gives power to an authorised officer who can either be a constable or a person authorised by the Attorney-General or a person exercising the power on behalf of the court to deal with these matters. The bill allows the authorised officer to take certain action in relation to persons on court or tribunal premises if it is believed on reasonable grounds that it is necessary in the interests of security to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An authorised officer may require the person's name, address and reason for being on the premises. A sufficient reason, I understand, is that they want to watch the proceedings of the courts. That seems very much appropriate. One would not want to be closing courts. I will come back to that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also may enable an authorised officer to require a person to submit to a search to determine whether a firearm, explosive substance or offensive weapon is hidden in the person's clothing or personal effects. The authorised officer could also require a person to deposit personal effects capable of concealing objects or effects capable of being used to injure other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authorised officer may direct a person who fails to comply with any of those instructions to leave the premises or to direct a person to leave the premises if the person does not satisfy the authorised officer that he or she has a proper reason for being on the court premises. The bill makes it an offence for a person without lawful excuse while on court premises to have in their possession a firearm, an explosive substance or an offensive weapon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of issues in relation to these powers that should be noted. The bill specifically states that a person has reason for being on the premises if they wish to attend the proceedings of the court. An issue a little while ago in relation to the Family Court was whether it should be open. I sat on a parliamentary committee that addressed that question. It has always appeared important to me that if justice is to be seen to be done then the courts ought to be open. That also applies to Family Court proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not want salacious interest in these matters in reporting them, but people need to be able to see what is going on. There is always a risk that the activities of the courts can be misrepresented if the decision making process is undertaken in private. In fact, it seems to me that if the courts are not demonstrably open it is likely to create the circumstances in which the risks that we are trying to deal with will be more likely to arise. For that reason, I think it is important to address these issues in a balanced way, weighing up the importance of ensuring that courts are open and accessible. These particular initiatives need to be undertaken in such a way as not to deny accessibility or to be seen to deny accessibility to the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further issue that I think should be noted is that while failure to comply with the direction of an authorised officer is subject to a penalty, authorised officers will have no role in enforcing any refusal of entry to or removal from court premises. It will be left to police to enforce such matters. I think it is important that the court administration be separated from these enforcement questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, certain safeguards are built into the personal search power. Clothing searches must be undertaken by a person of the same sex as the person being searched. A person cannot be required to remove clothing for the purpose of the search. They seem reasonable constraints on the way in which this matter is addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One minor matter of concern to the opposition is the designation of an authorised person. The ability of the attorney to appoint an authorised officer is unfettered. It would seem that the intention is for the power to be used to appoint as authorised officers officials of courts and tribunals which do not have power to administer their own affairs. That intention should be clarified by the government and consideration should be given to adopting criteria for the exercise of the attorney's appointment power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this legislation has been long coming and should have been before the parliament at least three years ago when the government first addressed this matter. The bill will be facilitated through this chamber, having the support of the opposition. We wish it, in that sense, a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As is usual in this place, when the opposition finds no fault with legislation it will nevertheless spend a number of moments criticising the government or find some reason to be negative. This is what we expect from this current opposition, an opposition with no policies on anything. If we want a debate on any of these issues and we ask them, `How about putting up an alternative view, how about having a policy, or how about giving us a position of where you stand?', we get the sort of response we have had today: pure negativism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing positive coming out from those in the opposition. They have said that the government has been at fault for three years. I have not heard the opposition putting up a private member's bill and I have not heard the opposition berating the government for not putting the legislation up. It is a purely negative approach for the sake of being negative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is designed to protect our courts. It presents some problems in terms of civil liberties in that courts should be seen to be open and freely accessible to people generally. We have legislation here which will give to officers of the Australian Federal Police force and serving officers of state police forces the power to ask questions of people in a court building, as defined by the legislation, and, indeed, to search without warrant the body of a person in a court building when that officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that that person carries an offensive weapon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the definition of `offensive weapon' is a codification of the old common law definition of offensive weapon. It goes back to the days when I was a serving police officer. The old Police Offences Act of Victoria contained the expression `offensive weapon', the common law definition of which was determined by the courts. Generally, it was then held that an offensive weapon was an instrument which could be used for the purposes of attack. This definition very largely brings into codification form that old common law definition of an offensive weapon. I note that an offensive weapon does not have to be made for a particular criminal purpose or for an attacking purpose. It is anything which can be adapted for the purposes of offence or attack. It is a fairly broad definition of an offensive weapon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also say to the House that I have some personal interest in this legislation. One of my children last year was involved, as a serving police officer, in an incident at the Family Court of Melbourne which put her certainly at some physical risk at the time that event occurred. As a father, I do have a fair degree of personal interest in ensuring that police officers have appropriate and sufficient powers to act in circumstances in courts where there is a threat to people on the premises of that court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the definition of what can be used by police officers for the purpose of having a reasonable suspicion to search includes a firearm. The definition of firearm is, again, a very wide definition and is similar to other definitions of a firearm in state firearms acts. This legislation adds `ammunition for any such weapon'. It is interesting that ammunition alone is now brought within the broad scope of the definition of a firearm. That, to my way of thinking, is perhaps an enlargement on what was generally regarded as a firearm in most state legislation. I have no objection to that at all. Explosive substance is, again, fairly broadly defined. It includes any machinery which may be used to cause an explosion in or with an explosive substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, this legislation gives police officers a very wide discretionary power to search people in a court building or court premises, as defined. It does, as I have indicated, take away in some way the right of people to have free access to the courts. It is in some ways another invasion upon the privacy of individuals in a court building. Nevertheless, it is something which I think this parliament should accept and something which I believe is necessary because of the changing nature of our society and the risk of violence faced by those who serve in our judicial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note, as other speakers have noted, that in past years in Australia there have been some quite terrible incidents, in the Family Court in particular. People whose practice requires them to practise in the Family Court are well aware that emotions run very high in a number of matters which the Family Court has to deal with, particularly those that involve property and access to children in a relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, back in the early 1970s, when the Family Law Act 1975 was enacted and the old Matrimonial Causes Act went by the board, solicitors practised very widely in the Family Court and I recall vividly that, when there were attacks on judges of the Family Court, we found in the Melbourne Family Court private guards, rather than police officers, suddenly appearing. I will never forget looking at them and seeing that they had on them a most astonishing array of weapons. I wondered at that time, as a solicitor attending the Family Court, whether these people had been adequately or properly trained in the use of some of these firearms they were carrying. They had between them 9mm Brownings, 45s, .38 calibre Police Special Smith and Wessons&mdash;an astonishing array of firearms were being carried by people whose capacity to carry those weapons I wondered about, firstly, and I also wondered whether or not they should be carrying weapons such as those in a confined place like a Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It still worries me, frankly, when I see civilian contractors being hired and armed to protect public officials. I would much prefer to see professional officers properly trained if they are to carry firearms in public places. I know that a lot of lawyers, back in the early 1970s, wondered whether, if an incident occurred in the Family Court, these people would just blindly shoot off in all directions; and they also contemplated what sort of risk we all faced as practitioners with these untrained people carrying firearms in such a confined space. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years our situation has improved. I think the Family Court is now better structured in terms of security compared with the way it was structured in the 1970s when the attacks on judges first started&mdash;and at that time many practitioners felt very nervous about attending the Family Court, I can tell you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, I think this is very pleasing legislation. I note the point the opposition raises in terms of `authorised officer'&mdash;and in some senses I can agree with that. I would not like to see the Attorney-General authorising private contractors, without the proper training, to be in the Family Court. As I have indicated, I have always had worries with these people. I would hope that is neither the intention nor the case&mdash;that unskilled, unprofessionally trained people or private guards are the sorts of people which we will see in the Family Court carrying this wide variety of weaponry in a way which I did not like, anyway. It is important that we do provide proper protection for our judges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is quite a small piece of legislation; in fact, there is very little in it. I note that primarily clause 13E provides a number of matters which give powers to police officers. That includes, as I have mentioned, the power to search a person; the power to order a person to leave a court premises; and the power to satisfy an officer that there is a proper reason for the person to be on the court premises&mdash;and, of course, it is a proper reason statutorily defined. A desire to attend a court or to watch a court in process is an appropriate and proper reason for a person to be on court premises&mdash;and that is very important, that the right of people to have access to our courts is recognised. I note also that there is power for an authorised person to have an arrest power, without warrant, in circumstances where provisions of this bill will be breached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a bill which this parliament should support. I am pleased again that the opposition&mdash;despite its negative approach, as usual, and without policy or substance in its attack on the government&mdash;will allow this legislation a speedy passage. I hope the Senate also will allow this legislation a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Amendment Bill 1995 proposes amendments to the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971 to allow police and other authorised persons to take protective security measures on the premises of federal courts and tribunals. The application of the powers given by the bill to particular federal courts and tribunals will depend on their security needs and will be determined by regulations made under the bill when enacted. I seek to make only a few comments on the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that this bill was prompted by a request from the Chief Justice of the Family Court to the Attorney-General some three years ago. If that is correct, this bill is set in the context of the series of terrorist attacks to which the Family Court was subjected in 1984, which included bombings of the court's buildings. The question that needs to be asked, as the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has asked, is: why has it taken three years for the Attorney-General to respond to that request some 11 years after the events to which it relates?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Court bombings are not the only instances of violence on court premises. I can recall one notable example in 1975 when a man walked into the Alice Springs courthouse carrying a rifle and loosed off two shots&mdash;one of them hitting a solicitor, Mr Edward Skuse, in the back. He was participating in criminal proceedings before a judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. The person who fired the shots was a disaffected litigant who had been involved in civil proceedings before another court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Skuse's misfortune did not conclude there. He sued the Commonwealth for negligence in failing to take reasonable care for his safety while on lawful business within the court. He was unsuccessful in an action before the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. He then appealed to the full court of the Federal Court, which upheld the decision of the Supreme Court. The result was that he was not only seriously disabled but also burdened with court costs orders for the two proceedings. I recall that distinctly because, as President of the Law Council of Australia, I was involved in making representations to the then Attorney-General on behalf of Mr Skuse. I was seeking to have some of those costs, if not all of them, released and to have some contribution to Mr Skuse's costs, in bringing what was a perfectly reasonable action, paid as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very regrettable that security measures to protect people in courts are becoming increasingly necessary. It renders the court less accessible to those for whom it is a proper place of access. The courts become less a meeting place for resolving community disputes and more a forum for formal confrontation behind metal detection barriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important also to recognise in this context a need for maintaining the independence of the judiciary. This is not a highfalutin phrase; this is a constitutional right designed to protect the interests of the Australian people. Reform of the relationship of the judiciary and the executive government in recent years has seen increasing responsibility for court administration being given to the courts themselves. The nature of the independence of the judiciary is therefore, as practised, changing. Whether the statutory vesting of the administration of a court in the head of jurisdiction, as applies in the case of the Chief Justice of the Family Court and the Chief Justice of the Federal Court, is a good thing is open to very serious doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My personal view, which I have expressed publicly before, is that the administration of the court should be vested in all the members of the court who can make whatever administrative arrangements are appropriate, having regard to the geographic distribution of the members of the court across the country and the practice or non-practice of engaging in circuits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is wrong, in my view, for the administration to be vested solely in one person who is, in effect, in a position to dictate to other members of the court what happens in administration. What happens in administration significantly can affect the functioning of the court. This is perhaps not the occasion to discuss that issue in any detail, but I think it is important that it be borne in mind in any consideration of any legislation or proposed legislation affecting the administration of courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill gives security powers to persons who are described as authorised officers. An authorised officer is defined in the bill as a person who is either a member of the Australian Federal Police, or a state or territory police force, or a person authorised to exercise the powers under the bill. A person may be authorised for such purposes in one of two ways. On the one hand, he or she may be directly authorised by the Attorney-General. The bill lists no criteria on which the appointment is to be made, nor does it place any limits on the Attorney-General's power of appointment. On the other hand, in the case of a court with the power to administer its own affairs, such as the Federal Court and the Family Court, the authorised person may be authorised by a person exercising the administrative powers of that court on behalf of the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The powers given to an authorised officer may be exercised if the authorised officer believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary in the interest of security to do so. Those powers include the power to require a person's name, address and reason for being on the premises; to require a person to submit to a search for a firearm, explosive substance or offensive weapon; to direct a person who fails to comply with any of these requirements to leave the premises; and to direct a person to leave the premises if he or she does not satisfy the authorised officer that he or she has a proper reason for being on the premises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has already been noted by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), the bill specifically states that wishing to hear the proceedings of a court or tribunal constitutes a proper reason for entering or wishing to remain on the premises. The explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill explains that the purpose of this is to make it clear that federal courts and tribunals with security regimes in place are still open to the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is provided sounds laudable in theory. The practical effect, however, may be questioned. It could be that the power for an authorised officer to direct a person to leave the premises by reason of having no proper reason for being there could effectively be neutered. Upon being asked to explain one's reason for being on the court premises, one merely needs to state that one wishes to attend the proceedings in court. Then the bona fides of that has to be examined by the authorised officer in order to determine whether or not there is another reason. The provision appears, in that light, to have no practical effect beyond the purely symbolic purpose expressed in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The power of an authorised officer to conduct frisk searches has an unorthodox feature. In an attempt to limit the exercise of frisk search powers the bill provides that a frisk search may be made only by an authorised officer of the same sex as the person to be searched. The bill then provides that, if an authorised officer of that sex is not available, a search can be conducted by any other person of the same sex who is requested to do so by the authorised officer and agrees to do so. This, in my view, provides an avenue for possible abuse. The explanatory memorandum does not give a justification for this unusual power. Perhaps the minister might like to offer one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also grounds for concern expressed by the member for Berowra about the Attorney-General's unfettered power to appoint an authorised officer with the powers I have just described. It seems that the government's intention is that the Attorney-General appoint as authorised officers officials of courts and tribunals which do not have power to administer their own affairs. If that is the case, the government should make that clear in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, it would be appropriate for the bill to set out the criteria to be applied by the Attorney-General when making an appointment. Some of the issues relevant to that were addressed by the previous speaker.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to be made to the National Health Act 1953 are to enact the decision taken in the 1995 budget to raise the safety net which applies to general patients under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each year in excess of 700 temporary resident doctors and 700 occupational trainees enter the Australian medical work force. These overseas temporary doctors are issued with conditional visas which restrict them to work in only specific `areas of need'; that is, in specified public hospitals or underserviced rural and remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been conservatively estimated that at least 10 per cent of these doctors will be moonlighting to some extent. The term `moonlighting' refers to temporary resident doctors and occupational trainees performing services outside their `host' institution or specified area of need, usually billing against another doctor's provider number. This practice is in breach of the Health Insurance Act 1973 but is difficult to detect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1995 federal budget, it was announced that measures would be taken to reduce the number of temporary doctors moonlighting in the system. To achieve this, amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 are proposed. These amendments will enable the effective detection of moonlighting. Specifically, they will:</PARA>
<PARA>1.restrict temporary resident doctors' and occupational trainees' eligibility to participate in Medicare benefits by amending the definition of `medical practitioner';</PARA>
<PARA>2.amend the definition of `professional service' in order to prevent one doctor from providing a service on behalf of another doctor but not to prevent a nurse or allied health worker working under the supervision of doctors to do so; and</PARA>
<PARA>3.allow the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to provide the information necessary to enable the Health Insurance Commission to trace those temporary resident doctors and occupational trainees practising outside any conditions imposed on them and to enable those temporary resident doctors and occupational trainees who are in breach of their visa conditions to be identified to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>It is estimated that these measures will result in savings of $18.5 million over the next four years. The proposed amendments should have no impact on those medical practitioners who are complying with the provisions of the Health Insurance Act. The amendments will, however, ensure that no medical practitioner will be able to `hide' behind another medical practitioner, except for the purposes of legitimate training. In addition to achieving savings in Medicare outlays, these amendments will reinforce the objectives of the national medical work force strategy agreed by health ministers in 1992 to reduce the impact of overseas trained doctors on the Australian medical work force. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also provide that Medicare benefits are payable for diagnostic imaging services rendered by consultant physicians; amend provisions concerning the form of requests for diagnostic imaging services; and provide for improved arrangements for remote area exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973, which came into effect from 1 May 1991, implemented a formal mechanism for requesting diagnostic imaging services, specified activities which were deemed to be prohibited practices and other matters. This included a provision that Medicare benefits were not payable for a diagnostic imaging service unless the rendering medical practitioner had received a written request for the service from another medical practitioner or, for certain prescribed items, a written request from a dental practitioner, a chiropractor, a physiotherapist or a podiatrist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain exceptions and exemptions from the written request provisions were put in place and these included an exception that certain services rendered by a specialist practising in his or her specialty, following a written request, attracted Medicare benefits at a higher rate than would apply if the service was rendered by a practitioner who was not a specialist or who rendered the service outside his or her specialty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lower rate traditionally related to services which were seen as falling within the competence of general practitioners and included x-rays of the extremities, chest and abdomen. The higher rate related to the same services when rendered by specialist radiologists after the receipt of a written request. The existing provisions allow Medicare benefits to be payable at the higher rate when these services are rendered by any specialist while practising in his or her specialty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An exemption from the written request requirement is also granted where services are rendered by a specialist in the course of practising in his or her specialty&mdash;other than in diagnostic radiology&mdash;and where that specialist had determined that the service was necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exceptions and provisions did not refer specifically to consultant physicians who rendered a diagnostic imaging service in similar circumstances. Consultant physicians and specialists both possess the same qualifications and have undergone the same training. However, a consultant physician must conduct a wholly referred practice exclusively in their specialty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it was intended that consultant physicians be treated under the provisions in the same way as specialists, there is doubt that the wording of the provisions authorise the payment of Medicare benefits in those same circumstances to consultant physicians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To clarify the matter, the bill provides specifically for Medicare benefits to be payable to patients for diagnostic imaging services rendered by consultant physicians when rendered in the same circumstances by specialists, and provides that the Commonwealth will not recover payment of Medicare benefits paid to patients in respect of those services from 1 May 1991, the date from which the changes became operative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides that the form and content of written requests for diagnostic imaging services by dental practitioners, chiropractors, physiotherapists and podiatrists may be prescribed in the same way as those by medical practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill allows for remote area exemptions to be for a shorter term than the present fixed period of three years. It provides for exemptions to be granted from the date the application was received rather than from the date on which the exemption was granted, which could be some weeks after the practitioner applied for exemption due, for example, to a delay in making a decision because an application was being investigated. The provisions are designed to reduce inconvenience to patients who receive diagnostic imaging services provided by rural medical practitioners, such as practitioners just taking up practice, or locums at a practice for a few weeks. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PBS has for more than 40 years been providing the Australian community with access to necessary medications and enjoys international recognition for its success. However, with an ageing population and the development of new drugs, the costs of operating the PBS are increasing every year. In 1993-94, for example, the cost of the scheme increased to approximately $1.7 billion. This cost must be borne by the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PBS safety net, which was introduced in 1986 to help patients who require a lot of medication, will remain available. There will be no changes to the safety net arrangements for pensioners and other concessional beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For general patients, the safety net threshold will be increased from $407.60 in 1995 to $600 for the calendar year 1996, with this amount to be indexed for subsequent years in accordance with movements in the consumer price index. Once a general patient and members of the patient's family have this amount recorded on their prescription record form, pharmaceutical benefits will be available at the concessional rate of $2.60, indexed, per prescription for the remainder of the calendar year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) for his second reading speech, which he presented in his usual clear and precise manner&mdash;perhaps not quite as long this time. While having the greatest personal respect for the way the parliamentary secretary carries out his role, I cannot help but think that the person who should be here giving this speech is the Minister for Human Services and Health, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), who is actually the portfolio minister. Perhaps she has got other matters on her mind at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the only piece of human services and health legislation programmed for this session of parliament at this point of the sitting, and it could be one of the last items of health legislation this government puts through the parliament. It is the second omnibus portfolio bill for 1995. Before I proceed any further, let us cast our minds back to the fate of the first omnibus bill which was split on the floor of the Senate, with the government as a result leaving key legislative provisions unpassed before we rose for the winter recess. I understand the parliamentary secretary is involved in sorting out this self-inflicted morass, but I also understand alternative provisions were made for the most urgent provisions in the non-passed portion of the divided bill and one wonders just how urgent or necessary that legislation was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the present omnibus bill, I should say right now the coalition does not oppose the passage of its provisions although, when it comes to the changing of the pharmaceutical benefits system general safety net, we agree to its passage somewhat reluctantly, and we do so because it was a declared budget measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill raises three principal areas of concern: dealing with moonlighting by foreign doctors who are temporary residents of Australia; making changes to the requesting, delivery and reimbursement of certain diagnostic imaging practices; and changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme safety net. I will talk about diagnostic imaging first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the most straightforward of the three areas of change the government is making. I do not need to restate the parliamentary secretary's outline of these in his second reading speech. It is straightforward and it is set out in the bill in language reminiscent of the complicated and logic bending language of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Perhaps that is why it took two pages of closely typed text to explain it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have any problem with what is being proposed in the primary changes under this heading relating to the treatment of diagnostic imaging rendered by consultant physicians. The amendments simply recognise the true status of consultant physicians as specialists in their own right and, as such, reasonably entitled to treatment under the Health Insurance Act for diagnostic imaging purposes, as are any other specialists rendering service in their area of expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no difficulty with the changes to the remote area exemption arrangements so as to change the calculation of the date of commencement and allowing for the period of the exemption to be less than three years. As the parliamentary secretary said, this should reduce the degree of inconvenience for patients in rural and remote areas, particularly by allowing for continuity of access by such patients to diagnostic imaging services rendered by rural medical practitioners, particularly qualified locums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are talking about diagnostic imaging, this is an area where we seem to have had complete policy sclerosis. There have obviously been financial difficulties for the government in this area. Diagnostic imaging is increasing by 11 per cent per annum. There has been a 25 per cent increase in ultrasounds just in the last 12 months. There has to be a very large element of cost shifting from state to federal governments in this. One cannot simply blame radiologists and other diagnostic imagers, because if you look at the amount of photographic film that is coming into the country&mdash;we do not make any ourselves&mdash;it is pretty constant, yet the amount which the Commonwealth pays is going up and up. I am very surprised that we have not had the capacity to look at this element of cost shifting because it does threaten diagnostic imaging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response has been to commission a report by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. This report is not going to be released officially until November, I think. I understand that what this report proposes would be sufficient to potentially put out of business every ethical radiological practice in Australia. If we do not give radiological practices the capacity to cater adequately for depreciation and look adequately at new equipment, if we do not address the issues of self-referral, we will have bigger problems later on. From what I understand of the Deloitte report, I am disappointed by its lack of scope. I just hope that the government does not make policy decisions based on it alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the bill deals with moonlighting by overseas trained doctors. This, of course, would give legal effect to some of the government's budget announcements in this area. I would suggest this has some bipartisan support. The amendments in this bill provide for the closing of current loopholes which allow temporary resident doctors and occupational trainees to provide, as registered medical practitioners, medical or other allied services, in breach of their visa registration conditions, on behalf of another practitioner. That is a pretty complicated way of saying that many trainees are funding part of their time in Australia by moonlighting on Medicare. Clearly, that should be closed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also tightens the Health Insurance Act's treatment of these doctors and trainees so that their conditional registration as service providers can be monitored more effectively and variations from these conditions more readily detected. I note the bill's provision for internal and Administrative Appeals Tribunal review of related decisions, and making it easier for the exchange of relevant immigration and provider information between the Health Insurance Commission and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the parliamentary secretary points out, more than 700 temporary resident doctors and 700 occupational trainees enter the Australian medical work force each year. This represents a very significant supplement to the domestic medical work force. These practitioners are confined nominally by their visas to specific areas of need, which are specified public hospitals and underserviced rural or remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear that in discussing these matters the coalition has no objection in principle to the concept of areas of need provided that no suitable practitioner can be obtained to fill a position. If you travel around rural Australia, you often hear praise of skilled and dedicated overseas trained professionals filling the all too often very visible breaches in the ranks of rural general and specialist practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, therefore, we have no difficulties with the proposals in this bill and we do not oppose them. They set out to redress particular problems and abuses. What we need to bear in mind is that these measures are just part of a much greater problem in shaping the medical work force as a whole and the general practice work force in particular. These amendments, admittedly, are not put forward as part of a strategic solution to the problems of medical work force planning, distribution and retention, but they do highlight an area of utter helplessness in coming to grips with the problems of the national medical work force and a serious maldistribution of medical practitioners, particularly general practitioners and obstetricians outside capital cities. It is an area which the present government, despite noises that we hear from time to time, has shown a lamentable lack of desire to tackle&mdash;despite Doherty, despite various resolutions of Australian health ministers' conferences and despite recent reports, such as the one by Professor Baume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area of medical work force is utterly frustrating. We still have a lamentable entry of female practitioners, who make up over half of medical graduates now, into some specialities. It is not that there is any discrimination; it may be that the training requirements are so utterly unfriendly to women that some specialties still have only 15 per cent of female trainees going through them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have specialties that think they can set lengths of training that are unparalleled anywhere else in the world and that say this is just a look at issues of quality. Again, this will affect women particularly hard. In surgery today, the minimum length of training is eight years, before you go overseas and before you come back and put up your shingle. It is all very well to have the gold standard for training, but specialty colleges should have some cognisance of what they are doing to their trainees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the utterly unacceptable situation where certain colleges might find it appropriate to fail a majority of trainees in any one year. That to me says something about the colleges' training, not the trainees, because these people are some of the brightest and best in the country. If they are going to fail over half of their trainees, it does invite someone at a later stage to seriously question the training that they are giving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last part is changes to the PBS safety net. I note in the parliamentary secretary's speech that we had two pages on each of the preceding two topics and only one page on the changes to the PBS. This is understandable because they are utterly unjustifiable. They are more controversial than the other two areas. As we all know, the budget raised the safety net threshold from $400 to $600. Labor justified this by saying it would not hurt health care card holders, whose more generous safety net was left untouched by the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that what we are looking at here is just another savings measure, looking to save $100 million over the next four years. That is all very well, but I think this measure is a quick fix, it is ill thought out and I do not think it is particularly well developed. Like the problem in dealing with overseas trained doctors, it is piecemeal, it is ad hoc and it is a response to a much more deep-seated problem that the government has not been able to come to grips with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me elaborate. We pointed out at the time of the budget that this represents savings without any particular equity. While the health care card holders' safety net is unaffected, and that may affect a very large proportion of PBS users, a measure like this will hit a large number of invisible poor. It hits people not well off or not with even comfortable incomes, for instance, who have a chronic illness, a terminal illness, who have heavy, ongoing and continuing reliance on pharmaceuticals but who do not pass health care card safety net tests. This would include many self-funded retirees and people on relatively low fixed incomes who have to manage a tight budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also includes your typical battlers&mdash;young families on a single or modest income or joint incomes who are struggling to make ends meet. Those families have kids. Those families have kids with child illnesses&mdash;asthma and chronic illnesses. Anyone with kids knows how often you are at the doctor. Another $200 a year on top could make a lot of difference to these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the need to contain rising costs in the PBS, as in other areas of Commonwealth expenditure, is understandable. But I think a serious misjudgment was made in introducing this particular measure in this particular way because, with the way it is targeted, the budget proposal enacted in this bill actually strikes at the very person Labor in 1986 claimed to have tried to help when it introduced the PBS safety net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people most directly penalised by the measure are those who are not well off financially but dependent on their own resources for support in a tight situation. That Labor wants to dismantle its safety net speaks volumes about just how out of touch it is with the lives of ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does not do anything to address or acknowledge any of the deeper problems. In addressing this bill, as you would expect, I consulted with industry, professional and consumer groups. I was struck by the accord between all three groups on the response to this piece of legislation. I was particularly struck by the opinion of one expert who, when asked his opinion of these measures, said, `It is cost cutting without policy justification.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A general view, which will no doubt interest and alarm those opposite who have trust in the ability of their leaders, is that Labor is simply failing to come to grips with why PBS costs are growing at the rate they are. These measures will do nothing for the way in which society consumes pharmaceuticals. These measures will not evaluate or modify doctors' prescribing behaviour or pharmacists' dispensing practices. These measures will not focus on our own expectations of medical treatment and the widespread faith in modern medicine and drugs which are reflected in the expectations that many of us have when we visit the doctor. What is generally needed in the PBS is greater efficiency and greater foresight. These measures offer none of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not see the changes to the PBS safety net as a budget measure as particularly constituting a broken promise. We therefore will not reject the legislation, but we can still condemn it. For this reason, on behalf of the coalition, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Labor government for the ad hoc and piecemeal measures contained in this Bill, particularly the harsh changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme general safety net, which will strike at Australians with chronic illnesses, Australians on low incomes with young families and retired Australians on fixed incomes".</PARA>
<PARA>This bill is something of a curate's egg: parts are sensible, particularly those measures on medical immigration and diagnostic images; but parts are all but indigestible, particularly the changes to the PBS. At a deeper level, this bill represents much that is wrong with this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than pose any solution or any way of tackling intractable problems&mdash;the medical work force and increasing costs in diagnostic images are both demonstrated here&mdash;rather than looking at any long-term solutions, `Let's have a stopgap bandaid.' These measures may be sensible in the short term but there is no innovation; there is no thinking in these areas at all. This legislation characterises the failings of a government that has long lost any sense of intellectual rigour in this area: `These are intractable problems; let's hope they will go away.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995, I express my appreciation for the fact that the opposition will support the bill and not oppose the measures contained in it. I also express my concern at some of the criticisms that have been made by the shadow minister for health, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), in his presentation. The opposition thinks it is a clever little tactic to move its amendment&mdash;which, of course, the government will oppose&mdash;but, before I move to some of the clauses of the legislation before the House today, I will respond to some of the criticisms made by the member for Chisholm in his comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Chisholm outlined that he felt that some of the measures were ad hoc and short-sighted and that they were not part of an overall program, particularly in relation to the medical work force issues and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It is interesting that he is always prepared to make these criticisms and attacks upon the government and to claim how we do not know what we are doing and that we are acting in an ad hoc way, but at no time did I hear one suggestion made by him about what his party would do if they were in charge of health and how they would fix these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is once more an example of the opposition being quick to criticise but having no alternative strategy in place. It is once more an example of the policy free zone that we have coming from the opposition. They can jump on the bandwagon and be quick to criticise, but they have not done any hard work in developing alternative strategies or policies. This House would be very interested to hear what the opposition would suggest as ways of fixing the medical work force issues, which are very strong and important issues that we do need to tackle and for which the government does have a comprehensive plan in place to address. It is of some concern to me that once more the opposition is prepared to attack without any alternative strategy being articulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Chisholm outlined his concern about the growth in costs of radiology to Medicare and the cost of diagnostic imaging. What he failed to tell the House was that four years ago this government brought forward a legislative package that would have addressed the blow-out in radiology costs to the government and to Medicare and the opposition blocked that package in the Senate. If anybody is going to be responsible for the blow-out in costs to Medicare and to the taxpayers of this country for radiology and diagnostic imaging it is the opposition for the way in which they acted irresponsibly in the Senate four years ago. They are now coming back and criticising us because there is this blow-out which they are directly responsible for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it needs to be made quite clear to the House that the government is seeking to address the costs of radiology. We are working with the industry on that matter and we are developing packages to try to contain the costs to taxpayers of an ever increasing usage of radiology and diagnostic imaging services. The opposition needs to act a bit more responsibly in this place and support the government in those initiatives rather than criticising the government for the fact that these costs are blowing out. Yet the opposition is blocking every measure that we try to put in place that would provide a reasonable limitation. Those are just a couple of the comments I would like to make in response to the criticisms that the member for Chisholm made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three main measures in this bill. One refers to the medical work force&mdash;the access of temporary resident doctors and overseas trained doctors to work and the limitations on where they can operate. The amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 are sought in order to allow the Health Insurance Commission to police and enforce more effectively arrangements relating to temporary resident doctors and occupational trainees. The situation has occurred where some medical practitioners are breaching the conditions of their visas by not containing themselves and their work to the areas of need that they were initially allocated to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a considerable shortage of medical practitioners in rural and remote areas. The government, with the support of the opposition, has organised a program of temporary visas for medical practitioners to work in those areas to deliver services to those communities in need. However, the terms and conditions of those visas are that those doctors are supposed to remain in those areas. That is why they have been allowed into the country to work. They are supposed to stay in those areas and some doctors have been breaching that. This amendment will ensure that does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments are also designed to prevent the number of doctors `moonlighting' in the system. The term `moonlighting' means that doctors are using other doctors' Medicare numbers to practise and are billing patient services against another doctors' provider number. These amendments will ensure that the health department is able to act more speedily in ensuring that those practices are stamped out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The diagnostic imaging clause in the bill is to improve the operation of the diagnostic imaging section of the bill to include opportunities for consultant physicians to recommend diagnostic imaging services. Consultant physicians were excluded from previous amendments to the Health Insurance Act. We are now correcting that error by including them in the system. That will provide greater equity and fairness for consumers and for providers. It reflects the commitment the government has made in this budget to better health outcomes for all Australians in the delivery of these important services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That amendment and the amendment relating to pharmaceutical benefits are two important measures that are contained in the 1995-96 federal budget. There are a number of other important measures contained in the budget that build upon the government's achievements in health care for all Australians. One important measure also contained in the budget is the increase in funding for general practice grants. These have been increased from $71 million in 1994-95 to over $200 million in 1995-96. These are very important grants which improve the delivery of general practice services for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real effort on the part of the government to address concerns about the medical work force. We are aware that there is a massive imbalance in the allocation of medical practitioners around this country. Australians living in rural and remote areas and even some provincial city areas do not get the same access to medical services as people in capital cities and large metropolitan areas have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have put in place a number of programs such as the rural incentives program, which is part of the general practice reform strategy. We have allocated $15 million this year to that program to provide greater incentives for general practitioners to operate in rural and remote areas. We have also included in our medical training programs a rural medicine component, which is designed to give medical practitioners specific skills in the treatment of medical conditions they are going to face when they work in rural and remote areas. We are providing a major program to address these issues and we are working in close consultation with the AMA and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners to deliver these services to rural and remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real understanding within this Labor government of the need to improve access to medical services for people in rural and remote areas. We do have a comprehensive program in place. We are working closely with the medical industry to ensure that that program is achievable and does achieve our aim, which is better access and better equity in the system for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I reject most strenuously the criticisms by the opposition spokesperson on health, the member for Chisholm, which he made in his comments. He said that the measure relating to temporary resident doctors was just an ad hoc measure that was not part of a comprehensive program. There is a very clear, comprehensive program in place which the medical profession supports and which this government has had going now for at least two years and which it will continue to support and expand over the coming years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the measure in the bill relating to pharmaceutical benefits, the shadow minister again outlined criticisms of the measure&mdash;he said that it was unfair and unreasonable&mdash;without ever outlining what this government has done in the area of pharmaceutical benefits, which provides a very important service to all Australians. He failed to outline that in the 1993-94 financial year this government committed $1.7 billion in funds towards the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. That is $1.7 billion of taxpayers' funds that have gone to support those Australians who are in need of pharmaceutical support. That is a commitment by this government to providing a fair, equitable and accessible scheme for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia and Australians benefit from one of the best and most comprehensive pharmaceutical benefits schemes in the world. We are far more generous in our allocation of support through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme than almost any other country&mdash;particularly countries in the Western world. We have had significant growth in the costs to the taxpayers of this country for that scheme. Any responsible government from time to time needs to look at the costs that these schemes are imposing on the taxpayers and review what measures it has in place. That is what is included in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are unhappy that these things have to happen and that we have to slightly increase the cost to ordinary taxpayers for their pharmaceutical benefits. But we also have to be responsible to the whole nation, the budget and the general population in looking at the cost of medical services&mdash;and pharmaceutical benefits as a component of that&mdash;to the taxpayers. Therefore, this measure in this financial year will reduce the allocation that we make to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by about $10 million. We will still be expending, therefore, over $1.7 billion on pharmaceutical benefits support to all Australians this year. But we are reducing that slightly by about $10 million. That is being done by expanding the safety net arrangements by increasing that benefit from $400 to $600. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has already been outlined, low income families, low income people and people who hold health care concession cards are not impacted by this change. Their safety net arrangements have not been affected and will not be changed. This is a responsible measure by a government which has been responsible to all taxpayers in this country. It is designed to make some minor savings in the overall costs of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as concerns the delivery of medical services to this country, the three measures&mdash;diagnostic imaging, temporary resident doctors and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme changes&mdash;are minor in the total scheme of things. But they are important amendments, and they deserve the support of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a number of interests in the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995, not the least of which is that my own portfolio responsibility deals with veterans' affairs. For the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) to suggest that the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme safety net arrangements are in any way minor is incorrect. They might be minor in the context of $120,000 million worth of government expenditure, they might be minor in the context of $100,000 million of government debt, but they are not minor when you are a person suffering prostate cancer and you find that you have to increase your personal annual outlays by 50 per cent&mdash;from $400 to $600 a year&mdash;before government assistance is available. That is not minor; in fact, it is an extreme disadvantage, an imposition on those sorts of people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Unfortunately, the PBS, as we know it&mdash;the pharmaceutical benefits scheme&mdash;does not even cover some of the drugs that are available for people with things like prostate cancer, and veterans are finding this a severe problem. There are some measures, which I welcome, that have assisted them in obtaining overall assistance in that regard. But where people are confronted with having to buy drugs regularly that, firstly, are sometimes in the PBS but which they need in largish quantities at $15&mdash;or whatever the figure now is&mdash;a prescription or, secondly, where they are obliged to buy items that are still outside the PBS, adding $200 to their annual outlay can create severe difficulty for them. I hope the member for Moreton understands that, whilst $10 million is not much money when we throw figures around in this place, $200 is a lot of money to some people. I just make that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I welcome with another hat on&mdash;that is, representing a rural electorate&mdash;that under diagnostic imaging the government has decided to make the exemption rules a little easier where the application of the general ordering and benefit rules would cause physical and financial hardship to patients in the designated remote areas. I welcome that initiative. Quite clearly, when people in those areas need diagnostic imaging and the processes are too difficult and cause hardship, we should naturally relax them, and that is apparently what is being done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that, in a similar situation, changes to travel entitlement in remote areas are creating difficulty for some veterans suffering post-traumatic stress disorder where they have been told to reposition their acquisition of these services to a new psychiatrist. Whilst that would be fine if you were having some general medical problem which just required treatment by a doctor and an appropriately qualified doctor were within the area or closer to where you lived than the one you had been in the habit of using, I see no problem with asking them to visit a doctor who is closer, to reduce the cost of travel concessions. But, when people have had two or three years of treatment by a psychiatrist and they are suddenly told they have to use one closer, the circumstances are different. I make that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that there is no minister in the House with any responsibility in this area, because we do get opportunities to put these cases and to put the logic of the difference between someone getting services for a bad back or something like that and someone who has built up confidence in a psychiatrist and is then told to go and find another one who is closer. I just find that different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made representations in writing, and I wanted to take the opportunity to mention that today in light of the reference on this issue to remote area people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to address the issue that is also covered in this legislation of control over foreign medical practitioners and trainees. Whilst the coalition supports the government's initiative, I think it does require some consideration, because I represent an electorate where people are still experiencing grave difficulty in attracting Australian trained doctors to what are quite lucrative practices. It is not as though they go out there and have to run around on a pushbike and cannot feed the kids; they are quite lucrative practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just the other day I had to seek on behalf of the shire of Dalwallinu a direction from the state minister of health that their district is classified as an area of special need. We apparently have 3,000 too many doctors in Australia and none of them is prepared to go out and service these areas that are a couple of hours drive from the city of Perth. These areas have excellent social facilities and sporting facilities and a wonderful community, and our doctors will not go there. These people are constantly being obliged to advertise overseas and go through what will now be an even more restrictive process just to get themselves a medical practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In support of this legislation, the other problem is that so many of those medical practitioners see this as just a stepping stone to sitting out a term of penance in the bush so that they can jump down to the population concentrations of Australia and get on the Medicare gravy train. If anybody wants to tell me it is not a Medicare gravy train for general practitioners, let me quote the figures: 63 per cent of your outlays go to general practitioners while your hospital system is in crisis. I have never been able to work out why a system had to be developed that gives persons like us in this room a free visit to a general practitioner which probably costs two rounds of drinks when in fact we have all these restrictions on what people can be paid in terms of their hospitalisation, which can be a really severe financial burden to most people in the community. </PARA>

The reality is&mdash;and I want to make this point again&mdash;that we support the effort to control this thing until something is done that encourages doctors to go to rural areas. In my state the local government people have put together a foundation at great cost to local communities. I think the foundation might be in the order of $3 million.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to touch on that in a further point. The other day I commenced receiving submissions from bulk-billing doctors that they are not getting their money on time. Again, if the minister were sitting here, she might be interested in this. Bulk-billing doctors are apparently entitled to an 11-day turnaround on payments. Because of the reduced payment, they need to get their money up-front or fairly early simply because they have to pay their staff, their rent and that type of thing. With only one client&mdash;namely, Medicare, or the health commission&mdash;they have been promised by legislation that they will get an 11-day turnaround on their claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received advice that these claims are more likely to be paid within four or five weeks.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 will allow the Health Insurance Commission to better police and more effectively endorse arrangements relating to temporary resident doctors, commonly known as TRDs, and occupational trainees, OTs. Amendments are proposed to the Health Insurance Act 1973 which relate to requirements for the payment of Medicare benefits for diagnostic imaging services. These amendments are designed to ensure that Medicare benefits are payable for diagnostic imaging services rendered by consultant physicians to provide for the form of requests for diagnostic imaging services and to provide for improved arrangements for remote area exemptions. As I said, the last amendments are to be made to the National Health Act 1953 to change the safety net arrangements which apply currently to general patients under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first issue is that of changes relating to temporary resident doctors and occupational trainees. Members of this place and, more importantly, the general public should be aware that temporary resident doctors and occupational trainees are currently allowed to enter this country on temporary visas which entitle them to work in public hospitals or in areas of need, such as underserviced rural and remote areas throughout Australia. In my area of Franklin in Tasmania we certainly have some of these rural and remote areas, not necessarily in mainland terms but certainly in distance and isolation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the 1995-96 budget, measures were announced aimed at reducing the number of temporary doctors moonlighting in the system. The term moonlighting refers to those temporary doctors performing services outside their host institution or area of need, usually billing against another doctor's provider number. It is a bit like using someone else's plastic card and having them pick up the bill. Moonlighting doctors breach their visa conditions and also their conditions of registration. Under the current provisions of the act, these TRDs and OTs providing medical services in breach of their visa and registration conditions are able to escape detection by providing services quaintly described as `on behalf of another practitioner'. In such circumstances, the bill for those services is rendered under the name of the doctor on whose behalf the service was rendered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To achieve a reduction in this practice and to enable the effective detection of those practising this moonlighting, the amendments proposed in this bill will, firstly, restrict the eligibility of temporary resident doctors and occupational trainees to participate in medicare benefits by amending the definition of medical practitioner; secondly, amend the definition of professional service in order to prevent one doctor from providing a service on behalf of another doctor but not to prevent a nurse or allied health worker working under the supervision of doctors; and, thirdly, and I think quite importantly, allow the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to provide the information necessary to enable the Health Insurance Commission to trace those temporary resident doctors and occupational trainees practising outside any condition imposed on them. I think the general public in Australia would think that is fair and reasonable. It will also enable those temporary resident doctors and occupational trainees who are in breach of their visa conditions to be more easily identified to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from forcing those who are flouting the law to be more easily identified and dealt with, there is an obvious cost benefit to the Australian taxpayer&mdash;not an insubstantial sum&mdash;with estimated savings over the next four years of approximately $18.5 million. That is an amount which could, I think, be easily spent on expanding some of the medical services that are currently in need of additional resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments should have no impact on those medical practitioners who are doing the right thing. Here we are really only talking about 10 per cent of these people, a really small number. As you can see, those 10 per cent are costing the Australian taxpayer quite a considerable amount of money and are not complying with the provisions of the Health Insurance Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will, however, ensure that no medical practitioner will be able to hide behind any other practitioner, except for the purpose of legitimate training. As well as providing savings in Medicare outlays, a worthy objective by itself, these amounts will reinforce the objective stated by Commonwealth and state health ministers to reduce the impact of overseas trained doctors on the medical work force here in Australia. The previous speaker spoke about some of the problems associated with that. This, in itself, is surely another worthy objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area of amendments proposed by this bill relates to the somewhat sensitive area of diagnostic imaging services. These amendments are designed to ensure that Medicare benefits are payable for diagnostic imaging services rendered by consultant physicians to provide for the form of request for these services and, as I said earlier, to provide for improved arrangements for remote area exemptions. As honourable members should know, amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 which came into effect in May 1991 set in place a formal mechanism for the requesting of diagnostic imaging services and specified activities which were deemed to be prohibitive practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that legislation, certain exemptions and exceptions from the written request provisions were put in place. These included an exception that certain services rendered by a specialist practising in his or her specialty following a written request attracted Medicare benefits at a higher rate than would normally apply if the service was rendered by a practitioner who was not a specialist or who rendered the service outside his or her own specialty. The exceptions and provisions did not refer specifically to consultant physicians who rendered a diagnostic imaging service in similar circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consultant physicians and specialists both possess the same qualifications and have undergone the same training. However, a consultant physician must conduct a wholly referred practice exclusively in their specialty. To clarify this matter, the bill provides specifically for Medicare benefits to be payable to patients for diagnostic imaging services rendered by consulting physicians when rendered in the same circumstances by specialists, and provides that the Commonwealth will not recover payments of Medicare benefits paid to patients in respect of those services from 1 May 1991, the date from which those changes became operative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that the form and content of written requests for diagnostic imaging services by dental practitioners, chiropractors, physiotherapists and podiatrists may be prescribed in the same way as those by medical practitioners.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for remote area exemptions to be for a shorter term than the current three-year period. The provisions are designed to reduce patient inconvenience for those who receive these services provided by rural medical practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last aspect of this bill relates probably to the most controversial part&mdash;that is, changes to the safety net threshold relating to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Gladly, in my mind, there will be no changes to the safety net arrangements for pensioners and other concessional beneficiaries. I think this is, and should be, taken for granted. However, in all honesty, I am really concerned that by increasing the safety net threshold for general patients to $600 in 1996 we are going to place a real strain on many low wage earners and families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate there are huge areas of broadacre public housing where families are just entering the work force, in many cases after long periods of unemployment. Tasmania has the highest unemployment rate in Australia. We have these people, as I say, entering the work force. They are living in areas where there is inadequate housing, which I am sure relates specifically to many of their medical problems. They have inadequate health services. By placing this additional burden on them, when in many cases they have chronic health problems, especially some of the young children, we will place a real additional burden on those families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, more than any other government, has endeavoured to ensure that there is a real safety net under the social justice strategy. Over the last 12 or 13 years in which we have been in government we have assiduously endeavoured to ensure that very few families fall through this safety net. But I can give dozens of examples in areas very close to my electorate office at Bridgewater. In some of the rural and remote areas in the Huon and Channel, where there are real difficulties in the provision of health services, there is inadequate housing and there are very few services to enable families to function as a family should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting this additional strain on them causes me grave concern. These people are struggling to pay their power bills, to pay their housing commission rents and to feed and clothe their children, despite all the things that we as a federal government are doing. The state government is giving them a hard time and is not providing the services adequately to enable these people to function as middle-class families in better off areas in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) to monitor this aspect of the change in the legislation. I know we are looking after pensioners and other concession beneficiaries&mdash;and that is great; so it should be&mdash;but many of these families, for the first time in two or three generations, are getting back into the work force through many of the Department of Employment, Education and Training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really need to monitor this and have a close linkage between members of parliament and service organisations in the electorate so that when families are placed in jeopardy we have some structure in place. I know it is fine to say the figure is $600 but, to many, finding that additional $200 is going to be a hell of a burden. As the federal Labor member for Franklin, I can assure the minister that I will be in constant touch with my electorate to monitor that additional stress. Two hundred dollars does not sound like much, but with all the other additional strains and stresses on these families I think I should put the minister on notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those few words, I would like to conclude my comments on this bill. When it comes to 10 per cent of OTs and TRDs rorting the system and we can get $18 million back, and when it comes to changes to the diagnostic servicing provisions as well, that is all fine&mdash;and so it should be&mdash;but the safety net arrangements are a bit of a concern. I welcome this opportunity to alert my constituents to these three changes to the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. I finally remind the minister that we need to closely monitor this whole aspect. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate in the debate on the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. This omnibus bill gives effect to several of the government's budget announcements. The primary effect of the bill involves the tightening of immigration and other controls over the movement and operations of temporary resident doctors and the drawing back of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme safety net from $400 to $600 per year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most temporary resident doctors and occupational trainees are salaried staff members in public hospitals, and some foreign doctors accept temporary medical registration to provide services in designated areas of need&mdash;usually underserviced rural and remote areas. Visa regulations control the extent to which practitioners can practise. A problem does exist when the doctors under these provisions moonlight outside of these conditions. Therefore, this bill will close current loopholes which allow medical practitioners to breach their visa regulations. The opposition has no problems with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also tighten the definition of `medical practitioner' and provide for easier exchange of information between the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Health Insurance Commission. The tight restrictions on the operations of medical practitioners with temporary residency is the result of the national oversupply of medical practitioners, particularly general practitioners. However, the national oversupply obscures the fact that there are actually severe shortages of general practitioners in rural and remote areas&mdash;a subject that has been discussed widely in this House and documented through the national media but remains unaddressed. These are areas where it is difficult to attract and retain GPs and where the current area of need arrangements for conditional registration of overseas trained doctors are very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other primary measure is the change in the pharmaceutical benefits safety net, raising the threshold for total personal contributions to pharmaceutical costs from $400 to $600. This is a savings measure without any consideration of equity. Those who are hit hardest are people with illnesses who do not qualify for the health care card, including self-funded retirees and young families with children who are subject to the usual range of childhood illnesses. This cynical measure strikes at the very people the safety net was introduced to protect. This measure will hurt people who are not financially well off but who are dependent on their own resources for a living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this hypocrisy by the government is representative of its approach to health issues generally, particularly the provision of health services in rural and remote areas. The great rural and remote areas, where so much of the wealth of the nation is created, are forgotten by the Labor Party. Certainly, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) fails to even address the problems associated with health provision in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The piecemeal approach of the measures in this bill strikes me as particularly offensive given the diabolical state of our public health system and the appalling scarcity of health services in rural areas. I have only to draw on the example of my federal electoral of Maranoa in Queensland to demonstrate the situation and the scarcity of health services in rural and remote communities at my back door. I will make sure today in my contribution that the concerns of my constituents, which are reflected in many rural and remote parts, are given some time in the debate on this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know many ordinary Australians share these concerns as they hear almost daily of the deteriorating standards of public health in this country and the ongoing exodus of subscribers from private health insurance. That is an issue the federal health minister still fails to address. Almost weekly we see in the national media figures representing a continuing decline in the number of people taking out private health insurance. It strikes me as incomprehensible that a matter of such paramount significance and of such great necessity as the provision of adequate health services could be handled with such incompetence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not attempt to attribute specific blame for the horror stories which regularly emerge from the casualty facilities and operating theatres of our public hospitals. That is for the Commonwealth and state governments to thrash out. However, I do blame the Commonwealth for its complete lack of leadership with regard to the development of a sustainable system of health care provision. Its blind faith in the public hospital system and its ability to cope with an ever growing proportion of the population in the public health system is staggering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the dismissive manner in which it has treated the providers of private health care has been most unbecoming of a national government that should be showing leadership. The sooner the beleaguered Minister for Human Services and Health acknowledges the enormous problems in the public health system, accepts its shortcomings and supports those who engage the private health system, the better the health care of all Australians will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year the tragic story of a Brisbane man who died after a seven-hour wait in the Brisbane emergency unit painted a bleak picture of the crisis in the public hospitals of this nation. The Queensland government argued at the time that the man's death was totally unpredictable. However, the fact remains that a seven-hour wait is unacceptable for any condition and could hardly be conducive to any sort of recovery. When you consider it was in the casualty area, a seven-hour wait by any standards is an unacceptable delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The man's death prompted an outraged response from three senior Queensland doctors who told of critically ill people being left unsupervised, ward and theatre closures, surgery waiting lists and severe overcrowding. One doctor told of the case of a 75-year-old woman, suicidal with pain, who had been waiting for a hip replacement. After finally being admitted to hospital and premedicated, she awoke to find that the operation had been postponed. Those are examples of urban communities. While urban residents are frustrated by the shortages of services, rural residents cope with an absence of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Department of Human Services and Health statistics, at least 100 communities throughout Australia have not got a GP or enough general purpose practitioners. The Rural Doctors Association put this figure a lot higher. I have a great deal of regard for the Rural Doctors Association because the doctors who work out there in rural Australia are trying to cope with an overtaxed health system and a lack of access to services. The Rural Doctors Association is a very credible organisation and the minister would do well to listen to its concerns in this area. You could only compare the figure of 100 communities throughout Australia who do not have a GP or who do not have enough GPs with figures from a Third World nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shortage of specialists in rural areas is even more acute. It is not surprising that the study done by the Australian National University's National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health found that rural dwellers are disadvantaged when it comes to health services and that the federal government spends significantly less on rural patients than urban patients. The report advocated a greater allocation of money and effort to rural health. This is the Australian National University's National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, not the opposition. I think independent research like that is good reading for the minister for health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was found that rural dwellers were much more likely to become sick and die earlier and that rural women were 90 per cent more likely to die from influenza and pneumonia than women in the city. Other causes of death which have increased markedly in rural people over city residents are heart disease, stroke, respiratory problems, general injury, poisoning and urinary infections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report explained that, compared with urban dwellers, rural families experienced greater socioeconomic disadvantage, had more risk factors for disease and suffered greater ill health. These problems can largely be attributed to the scarcity of medical services, facilities and personnel in rural areas and the enormous distances which people must travel to access what facilities are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst people in remote areas have great problems at times in accessing these services, I have enormous respect for the great work of the Royal Flying Doctor Service network throughout this country. It is a network that deserves the support of the federal government and of this parliament. Any more resources that could be put forward to the Royal Flying Doctor Service could only enhance access to health services for those people living in remote Australia, where the Royal Flying Doctor Service operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great organisation. It is funded by the federal government, state government and major contributions through fundraising efforts of the local community. I commend the work they do and salute the people who work in the Royal Flying Doctor Service, whether it be the doctors, the nurses or the pilots. They are often called out at short notice in the middle of the night to fly into a remote cattle station and have to land on a bush airstrip lit up by motor vehicle headlights as an indication of where the airstrip is. The skill of the pilots and the determination and dedication of the people who work for the Royal Flying Doctor Service deserves the highest commendation of all Australians. They do provide an enormous service to these people where services are very thin and, in many areas, otherwise non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not unusual to hear of rural people opting for radical surgery rather than engaging in a more appropriate treatment which would keep them in a major city for a month or more. The reality is that there is no sick leave for the farmers and many rural small business people. There is very little compassion and comfort when you are 2,000 kilometres away from the comfort of home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of mental health facilities is another area in which rural dwellers suffer unacceptable levels of hardship. The Burdekin report on mental health revealed astonishing situations where mental care patients are afforded no dignity, little comfort and haphazard treatment. Fortunately, the release of the Burdekin report has had an effect and has forced action. My electorate of Maranoa, virtually unserved by mental health workers only a couple of years ago, now has access to permanent psychiatric and community based workers. However, their time and resources are stretched to the brink, trying to cover an area three times the size of the state of Victoria. Such is the land mass of the electorate of Maranoa, which I represent here in federal parliament. That obviously presents enormous problems for workers in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pressure faced by rural families as a result of the drought, small business closures and the lack of work opportunities demands and requires appropriate services and personnel. The New South Wales Far West Mental Health Team is an excellent example of what can be achieved by sufficiently dedicated governments and communities. The team travels regularly to a population of 33,000 spread over an area of 150,000 square kilometres. Team members actively work on melding into the local communities and breaking the traditional barriers to seeking mental health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are two sides to the problem. While the federal government has been somewhat reluctant to find funding for the provision of rural health services, it is clear that there are some disadvantages to rural practice which money simply cannot overcome. For example, a country posting is regarded as an unproductive career move for a budding young GP and the end of a career for a specialist. There is a sense of professional isolation associated with rural practice and little opportunity for career developments and diversification. The difficulty in attracting locum services exacerbates this problem for rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the rural incentive scheme has been a worthwhile contribution from the federal government, it still remains to be seen if the financial incentives being offered actually compensate for the perceived loss of opportunity which rural services appear to mean for health workers. However, it is at best a short-term solution and not one which tackles the historical problem of attracting specialist personnel to rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural health support education and training program provides a vehicle for the government to investigate ways in which rural services can be appreciated and recognised as a genuine and worthy career choice. It disturbs me, however, that the reports sponsored by the rural health support education and training program are bordering on the ridiculously repetitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, a grant under this scheme, grant No. 36, provides funding to the University of Queensland to develop an education and training program for physiotherapy, social work, occupational therapy and speech therapy professionals in rural and remote areas. Similarly, grant No. 38 provides funding to the Health Department of Western Australia to pilot an alternative physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy service to seven rural shires in the central wheat belt region and to use multiskilled allied health assistants in communities which do not have access to other than minimal visiting services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, similarly, a number of programs which target the development of a rural based undergraduate training program, the creation of rural practice manuals and the sourcing of locum services. Even more astounding is a grant provided to the Postgraduate Medical Education Committee in Queensland to achieve agreement between, and commitment from, both the Rural Doctors Association of Australia and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners on the form of a funding application to be submitted to the RHSET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that my time remaining is short. However, I urge the minister to look at the problems associated with the provision of and access to adequate health services in rural and remote Australia; it still remains an area of chronic underservicing. Whilst ever that situation remains&mdash;the failure of government to provide adequate services in rural and remote areas of Australia&mdash;we will continue to see a population drift away from those areas. One of the basic fundamentals of any society is good quality access to health services. That is not yet available in rural Australia; much of it is not far above the status of a Third World country service. I urge the minister to look at this issue more seriously. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again today I am pleased to speak in this chamber on another bill in relation to the human services and health portfolio: the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. In the last couple of years, I have spoken on a number of bills in relation to health issues. I believe that there have been many excellent enhancements and changes made to what is already an excellent health system&mdash;Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare is the fairest and most equitable health system that Australia has ever had. It is the envy of many countries around the world&mdash;including the United States. Medicare enjoys enormous popularity in the community. I think one survey showed that 85 per cent of Australians support Medicare. That is something which is not lost on members of this House, including members opposite&mdash;as is quite obvious from their more revised statements about what they will or will not do with Medicare if they ever get elected to government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as good and important as Medicare is, we can always improve it; we can always look at ways of improving the system. There are huge challenges in the Medicare system. The member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) has just pointed out one of them: the need to get better access and equity in health services to rural and remote areas. That is clearly one of a number of challenges that we have with the Medicare system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another obvious challenge is the fact that costs do blow out. The costs of medical benefit schedule items alone are now about $5 1/2 billion a year and are still going up by between five to 10 per cent a year. That is a reduction on what was happening a few years ago, but it is still obviously more than is desirable. There are many reasons for that, and I have spoken about those reasons in this House before. It is to this government's great credit that we have been taking on those challenges, particularly in the last couple of years. The current Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has played a very positive role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, there are a lot of challenges in the health area. There are a lot of exciting and innovative projects coming forward which will reduce costs and at the same time provide better access and equity to health services around Australia. Some of those are reflected in the bill that we are talking about today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is attracting a bit of attention from various people at the moment&mdash;particularly from the opposition, who have not got much else to do other than throw mud at people, and from people in Western Australia, to divert attention from their own problems. All I can say is that, in the last 15 months or so, since the current minister has been there, we have had some wonderful improvements brought forward in the health portfolio, and I believe there are more to come. I think that is very encouraging because, although Medicare is an excellent system&mdash;as I said, it is the envy of most countries in the world&mdash;there is a bit more work to be done to make sure that it is as equitable as it can be without blowing the revenue out too much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three main issues in this bill: first, the amendments to the Health Insurance Act, which will bring about more effective arrangements relating to temporary medical doctors and occupational trainees; second, the proposed amendments to the Health Insurance Act which will deal with diagnostic imaging services, and I will come back to them in a minute; and, third, the budget announcements in relation to the safety net for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Health Insurance Act will allow the Health Insurance Commission to more effectively police or enforce the arrangements in place relating to temporary resident doctors and occupational trainees. Temporary resident doctors and occupational trainees are currently allowed to enter Australia on temporary visas which entitle them to work in public hospitals or in areas of need, such as the underserviced rural and remote areas that the member for Maranoa was talking about before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of this year's federal budget, measures were announced that were aimed at reducing the number of temporary doctors moonlighting in the system. The term `moonlighting' refers to those temporary doctors performing services outside their host institution or area of need; that is, outside the public hospital that they are supposed to work in or outside their designated area&mdash;for example, a designated remote and rural area. In doing this, they are quite often billing against another doctor's provider number. The moonlighting doctors thus breach their visa conditions, the Health Insurance Act and their conditions of registration. It is estimated that of the temporary resident doctors or occupational trainees at least 10 per cent are moonlighting to some extent. Under the Health Insurance Act, there is not much we can do about that at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with moonlighting is that it is exacerbated by the fact that these TRDs, temporary resident doctors, and the occupational trainees either have access to medical provider numbers in their own right or can use another doctor's provider number to bill private services, despite the conditions being placed on their visa and/or their registration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Health Insurance Act allows Medicare benefits to be paid for professional services rendered by, or on behalf of, a medical practitioner. There is currently little to prevent these TRDs or OTs from either leaving the area to which they were assigned or engaging in private practice, regardless of the conditions imposed on the individual visa and/or registration, which specifies that the services are not to be provided outside the public sector. So, in order to address the problem, the changes in this bill are proposed to prevent temporary doctors from being able to breach their visa or registration conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of doctors, particularly doctors coming from overseas, I am currently involved in an inquiry into migrant access and equity being conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, chaired by the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris). One of the most contentious issues arising from the inquiry is the recognition of overseas qualifications of migrants, mainly people with non-English-speaking backgrounds. A particularly contentious issue, and one that keeps coming up, is the issue of the recognition of overseas doctors. It seems that doctors, unless they come from the United Kingdom or from Australia, of course, are put through all sorts of hoops before they can practise in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise only too well that we have a situation where there is an oversupply of doctors or, more specifically, an oversupply of general practitioners in major capital cities. Of course, as we have heard, there is not an oversupply in the country areas; nor is there an oversupply in some specialties, because of the closed shop arrangements that the medical profession seems to be able to maintain, although this government is trying to do something about that. It is one thing to say that there is an oversupply of doctors, but it is another thing entirely to be seen to be discriminating against doctors, or anybody else for that matter, on the grounds that they were born overseas or that their qualifications are from a university overseas rather than from an Australian university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a fairly complex problem and one that the community affairs committee will be dealing with in its report on this migrant access and equity inquiry. The inquiry involves state health departments, which have the role of registering medical practitioners. It also involves the Australian Medical Council, decisions arising from health ministers conferences and the medical profession itself, which obviously seems to want to take every opportunity to restrict access, particularly to areas of specialist practice. We know of some of the notorious closed shop arrangements that exist in some of the specialties and I think that also applies in the case of some overseas doctors. So it is certainly an issue that, on the face of it, is inequitable and one which I hope the government can respond to satisfactorily after the committee reports on its inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue arising in this bill is diagnostic imaging services. There were previous amendments on diagnostic imaging legislation earlier in this parliament. As I mentioned before, one of the challenges with Medicare is to ensure appropriate access to the appropriate services for everybody and, at the same time, to keep costs down. I do not have the exact figure with me, but Medicare benefits in the schedule are still going up by up to 10 per cent per annum. But, more specifically, the cost of diagnostic imaging services is still going up by something like 13 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obviously the area, along with pathology, of rapid growth in our fee-for-service health system. While you have a fee-for-service system, and while you are trying to provide access and equity and a comprehensive universal health system at the same time, there are obviously financial pressures. The government recognises that and that is why we have had these amendments relating to diagnostic imaging&mdash;an area which obviously is subject to great advances in technology and an area where obviously there is a temptation and, in fact, a reality that doctors will use new technology and use, I guess, the demand for services to maximise their incomes. But, at the same time, in fairness, there is also an expectation by patients that they should be entitled to access to services that will provide them with more comprehensive health. So it is a balance that the government has to strike in consultation with the profession and the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is an issue that is fairly serious, as I have been saying in various capacities for about 10 or 15 years now. The issue of the inappropriate use of Medicare through either medical fraud or excessive servicing, particularly in these areas of radiology and diagnostic imaging as well as pathology, is a serious issue which the government has, over the last few years, been trying to come to grips with. I guess there is still a way to go. In relation to these measures in the legislation and in the previous amendments that went through earlier this year and that were effective from 1 May 1991&mdash;that was another lot of amendments that went through&mdash;I believe we are heading in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a couple of weeks ago I went out to Tuggeranong and spoke to one of the senior officers of the Health Insurance Commission. I was quite impressed with what I saw and heard there, having been critical in the past in this chamber of the Health Insurance Commission. Honourable members might recall that the commission took over from the department of health the responsibility for surveillance of medical fraud and overservicing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 an Auditor-General's report was fairly scathing of the efforts of the Health Insurance Commission during the previous seven years. I am pleased to say that since that report there has been a more positive response, which has been assisted greatly&mdash;this is acknowledged by the officers of the commission&mdash;by the efforts of this government with two particular pieces of legislation that were passed in the term of this parliament. I believe better results will be shown over time, over the next 12 months or so, in the areas of both fraud and inappropriate servicing. The commission will be able to demonstrate that it is making headway and is reducing costs to Medicare, which is so important from a revenue and equity point of view. I think this government has made quite significant progress, as has the Health Insurance Commission, in the last two or three years in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, Medicare is a fine system. It is supported by the Australian community, but there is only so much money to go around. With costs still increasing every year, it is important that we take every possible opportunity to reduce costs in an equitable and fair way while at the same time ensuring that the issues raised of equity and access in rural and remote areas, in mental health, in Aboriginal health and in other areas are taken care of as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, I commend this bill to the House. It is one of a number that have been presented to this House in the last two or three years that I have had the pleasure to speak on. We can only continue to make Medicare even better. I do not think we will ever see any government of any persuasion do away with Medicare. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. I certainly endorse the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland), in relation to the fact that Medicare has the overwhelming support of the Australian community. Having finally faced up to that fact, it would appear that the opposition is belatedly prepared to support Medicare. But how far that support will go I dare say we will get down to in the election campaign. One of the issues I will raise later in my speech is that I do not really know what the opposition health policy is. I do not think anybody else knows&mdash;but more of that later down the track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not have the luxury, unfortunately, to pay absolute close attention to the contribution from the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), whom I usually listen to blow by blow because his contributions are so riveting. He raised the issue of allegations made by some doctors in Western Australia in relation to bulk-billing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand from consulting on this matter that two or three months ago six doctors in Western Australia experienced some delays in payments when they were bulk-billing. This problem arose because the doctors did not fill out the forms correctly and therefore the scanner was not able to process them. There has been direct consultation with those doctors and the manager at the Health Insurance Commission. The scan lens is being replaced to improve its capability. These doctors have experienced no delays in payments since that time. There are further continuing consultations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again the member for O'Connor, a great one for outrageous allegations in this place, is out of touch and should get his facts correct. I dare say that, if that is the best we can hope for in terms of health policy from the opposition, the Australian community will be badly serviced indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other contribution I did not have an opportunity to attend to was that by the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), but I dare say I did not miss a great deal. What he probably talked about is the lack of doctors in remote and rural areas. That is an area of some concern to all members in rural and regional areas, and of course it is of concern to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part and parcel of a number of initiatives of which the matters in this bill form part, we should comment on the shortage of doctors in rural areas&mdash;which is something that is raised with me as I happen to represent 114,000 square kilometres of central Queensland, where there are very small communities. There has been a lot of concern in the run-up to the recent state election and a reorganisation of health services in my area. There was an awful lot of scaremongering happening and concern in the communities. I believe that the state government in Queensland is moving to ensure that we do have effective health service delivery in rural and regional Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I was at Wowan, a very small community in my electorate. With the assistance of Commonwealth government money, we have implemented a multipurpose health centre which has visiting services from doctors from hospitals in slightly larger communities. That is making a significant contribution to basic health care for the constituents of this very tiny town. I believe it is providing the facility for old people to be cared for and stay in the community in which they live and to bring in other allied services. It is also providing confidence to that community that they can access not only medical services but allied health services. This is the kind of opportunity that the Commonwealth and states working together can provide in rural and remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of factors which affect recruitment and retention of doctors in rural areas and they are not just about financial incentives. In central Queensland the financial incentives for medical practitioners to come and work in rural communities are very high. What stops doctors coming are other factors such as professional and family support and appropriate training and relief. The general practice strategy, which includes initiatives to address these factors, such as the GP rural incentives program, which we allocated over $15 million to in 1994-95, and rural loadings with the better practice program, are all attempting to support the allocation of doctors into rural and regional areas and to maintain them there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the national rural health strategy endorsed by the Australian health ministers in 1994 provides an agreed national framework for improving access to and the quality of health services for people in rural Australia, which includes recruitment and retention, as I said, of the rural medical work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government is aware of these issues and is working with state governments across the board. Part of what we are doing in this bill is to address some of these issues. The Commonwealth government's commitment to public hospital care in this country has been very real since it came into office in 1983. The Commonwealth hospitals funding grant has increased steadily in real terms from 1988-89 when the first Medicare agreements came into effect. There was a significant Commonwealth funding boost of 11 per cent in real terms in 1993-94. In the 1995-96 budget estimates the Commonwealth is providing the states with in excess of $4 billion to provide effective public hospital care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is a challenge to the states to maintain the standard and expansion of public hospital care for the community. That is something that I believe has not been picked up by the states. It amounts effectively to cost shifting back to the Commonwealth. We are currently negotiating with the states on a range of issues, including targets for waiting lists, outpatient services, accident and emergency and throughput, and attempting to address the issue of waiting lists in relation to actually rewarding hospitals for attending to patient need. Any waiting list does need to prioritise in terms of the clinical needs of the people on the waiting lists and, therefore, organising services, including specialist facilities, to make sure that those needs are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly in my area of Central Queensland one of the things that is stopping the throughput on the waiting list for surgery is the lack of anaesthetists in our region, and I am aware that the state government is putting funding into that area. But I was talking with doctors at the Rockhampton base hospital and Dr Bape Snr did clarify that the surgeons are available; it is the anaesthetists that are not. That issue is controlled by the college. So there are a number of issues. We have to explain those concerns to our communities. I have a number of constituents in the mining towns in my electorate who have to move to get some of these services. Even a regional hospital is three or four hours drive away from their communities. If they are told they cannot get that service for 12 to 18 months, of course that is going to concern and worry them. The Commonwealth government has a major commitment to address this waiting list issue, but it is going to need a great deal of cooperation from the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particular issue in the bill is the restrictions on overseas doctors. In my area of Central Queensland, we are very fortunate to have some excellently qualified overseas trained doctors. I am sure it has taken a bit of cultural shift for residents of CQ to accept this, but we have some excellent doctors who have come to live in our country for all the benefits and the freedoms that our country provides. They are making a magnificent contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the issue in the bill is that 10 per cent of overseas trained doctors are moonlighting on the system, and that is actually costing the government a significant amount of money. We expect to save on this tightening up of the use of Medicare numbers a significant amount of funds&mdash;about $18 million over the next four years. That is not in any way going to impede the excellent work done by the majority of doctors working within the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, it needs to be remembered that, for each additional full-time medical practitioner entering the medical work force, the net cost generated to the medical benefits scheme is in the order of $176,000 a year. That needs to be understood by the community, by the universities and by the medical community. A number of doctors write to me on a regular basis complaining about the medical system, how they are not able to make a decent living and so on, but the fact of the matter is that without the medical benefits scheme and Medicare, in which we effectively subsidise their income quite dramatically, many of them would not be making an income at all. We need to remedy this maldistribution and make sure that we have doctors where they are needed. As I said earlier, that is very much in regional and rural Australia, and we are moving to deal with this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that I want to raise is that there are many criticisms of the public health system. I had occasion recently to be, as it were, a customer of my own system once removed. I had a visitor from Victoria staying with me and she was unfortunate enough to suffer an epileptic seizure. The local ambulance service was brilliant and she was up at the Rockhampton base hospital very quickly. They did not know that she had anything to do with me, so it was not because I am the federal member that my very good friend from Victoria got this service. What pleased me was how expeditiously her case was treated. All the staff&mdash;the residents, the nursing staff and everybody who treated her&mdash;treated her with a great deal of courtesy, professionalism and consideration and I was very proud that our public health system worked so well for the benefit of our patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not had the opportunity to write to the director of medical services at this point but I certainly hope to pay tribute and send him&mdash;and the new director, Jeanette Young&mdash;a copy of this speech. There are always criticisms, because we live in a country in which the community expects the highest standard of health care. If we compare ourselves with many other countries, the Medicare system, which is one of the great contributions from the federal Labor government over the last 13 years, has enabled all people, no matter what their situation, to access medical services when they need them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly remember, as a young social worker in Victoria, having to go cap in hand to the business manager of the Alfred hospital, begging and pleading that a person's medical bill be shelved because there was no way that this person could pay for that care. We cannot provide&mdash;and I do not think any community is ever able to provide&mdash;a 100 per cent immediate response to every situation, because at the end of the day a country can only provide the health services that it can afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other things we have been doing is putting a lot of funding into preventive health care so that we make sure that people improve their own health status. I guess smoking is a classic example&mdash;smoking, diet and exercise. I believe we have a great deal to be proud of with our health care. The arrangements in this bill in relation to how our temporary resident doctors and our overseas trained doctors use the system are in line with making sure that all aspects of the health care system are accountable, because at the end of the day taxpayers want to know that their funds are being used equitably and justifiably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike what is happening in some states, in Queensland the Labor government that has just been re-elected has made a commitment, through the new minister, Peter Beattie, to upgrade infrastructure&mdash;which, of course, ran down sadly under the former government&mdash;and improve access for all Queenslanders to the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My friend from Victoria was so impressed with her treatment, she said, `If this had happened to me in Victoria, I guarantee that I would have been lying on a trolley in a corridor for several hours, not taken straight into accident and emergency and treated immediately.' As I say, by the time I got there, which was within about 20 minutes, she was receiving all the care, attention and tests that she required, and all with a great deal of courtesy, consideration and sensitivity. I believe that at a national level the Commonwealth government is doing what it needs to do. It is a great challenge for the states to pick up the ball and run with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to find out a bit more from the opposition than some out-of-date allegations from the member for O'Connor. What is the opposition's health care policy? All we seem to have heard from them is that they are not going to slash into Medicare. The opposition have had 2 1/2 years and we still do not know what they are going to do. I believe the Australian community wants to know what they are and are not going to do to Medicare and what they are going to do about private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day it is the responsibility of government to make sure that all members of the community have access to the services they need, that the most needy and urgent cases receive the most prompt attention and that we increase, where we can, access to health care for all Australians. That is what this government has done consistently over its period in government. In comparison with many other countries, we have a very proud record. I pay tribute to Minister Lawrence because she has done a great deal in her portfolio to put forward a number of our reforms. It is very heartening to see that the private health insurance system is responding to the reform agenda that will come into place on 1 October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health insurance sector is moving to lift its game, to provide services, and that is the only way that people will have confidence in the private health insurance system. People have voted with their feet for good reason. If it is not cost beneficial to the consumer, why would you stay in it? The minister has put forward a package of reforms that will allow the private health insurance sector to offer a marketable product, and that reform requires both the private hospital system and the private specialists to come on board and work together. If they want to have a product that people want to purchase, then they are all going to have to lift their game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, it is the Commonwealth's responsibility to make sure that the public health system works to its optimal level. That is what we are doing and will continue to do. I want to reassure the people of Australia that the only way they can be assured of an excellent health system is to vote Labor at the next general election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments to the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 are welcomed. They are minor in the overall scheme of the health system, but they are quite pertinent particularly with regard to temporary registered doctors and occupational trainees. In an earlier speech, the member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) referred to a current parliamentary inquiry of which the matter of overseas training and recognition has become a quite major part. I do not wish to traverse too much of the ground of that inquiry, but it would be inappropriate not to refer to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question we have as a country is always one of balance&mdash;balancing our needs, our resources and our capacities. Governments, both federal and state, have addressed that question with regard to the quantity of medical practitioners and oversupply. A recent case found that it was discriminatory for overseas trained doctors to have a quota imposed on them in terms of their seeking recognition in Australia, and understandably so&mdash;I can understand that being a point. Certainly, witnesses in our inquiry took very strong exception to the fact that a particular group in the Australian community is being discriminated against in that form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There does appear to be some overt agreement from both sides of politics to the idea that allowing overseas doctors unlimited access to Australia causes apprehension. At the same time as we are looking at reducing the number of people who are graduating from our medical faculties, it would seem quite unreasonable to expect those graduates to compete with people trained overseas without our giving thought to the quantity. That issue will be around for some time to come, and it will need to be thought through much more carefully so that whatever we do does not discriminate but applies equally to all people in Australia, or to all with permanent residency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How we interpret our quotas, how we interpret our point score, how we apply immigration standards and what procedures we have need a lot more thought than simply saying, once again, that in Australia we will limit the number who sit for an exam. I am not surprised at that verdict, but we need to look very carefully at the implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments indicate the level of the problem as well. In Australia, people are here on a temporary basis, either as occupational trainees or as temporary registered doctors; they are not here as part of the Australian permanent residency or the Australian community but are visiting for particular purposes. They are able to use short-term registration and our particular system to work in a much broader way. This, therefore, impacts on the rest of the medical field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one hand, it is quite unfair for us to limit the number of graduates we are having; it is equally unfair, and perhaps wrong, to impose quotas on a particular group in sitting for exams. In amongst all of that, part of the reason for the exacerbation of the problem is the fact that we have people working in the field who are not supposed to be working in it. These amendments will prohibit those people using Medicare provider numbers in a way they were not intended to be used. That practice has not been appropriate, it was not legal&mdash;it was against the law&mdash;but it has been difficult to pin down and isolate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three different groups&mdash;existing doctors, those who wish to practice medicine but who cannot become doctors because of a quota system, and those who wish to come here as doctors&mdash;are competing. At the same time, we have had people here on a legitimate basis in a temporary form but acting in a way that was against the law because our procedures were not clearly defined enough. In a sense, it comes back to the fact that we have to think things through to the nth degree to prevent people abusing a system or avoiding responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So many of our amendments in this place are attempts to block not so much loopholes but situations you could not imagine would arise. You could not imagine that a temporary doctor would use the Medicare provider number of another doctor with that doctor's agreement. It is against the rules; it is against the law. It would seem unnecessary for us to have to pin down how they could do that or why they are doing that. The fact that we have to do it constantly as a community is a bit disturbing. But we have to tie up everything with red tape and pin it down in precise terms because, if we do not, someone will misuse the system. That is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this poses the wider community question of what we do about the supply of doctors and that must be examined by governments at federal and state level. The fact that the opposition is supporting these amendments is indicative that this is not a matter of controversy in itself but it may lead to controversy in the years ahead unless we can establish some methodology, particularly when people with overseas qualifications come to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been disturbed to uncover to some degree the processes by which doctors and many other professionals are registered in Australia. The processes appear to be tortuous and incredibly complex and, in themselves, discriminatory. We have had some interesting examples, such as that of a specialist from Germany who was head-hunted by a university in Queensland and offered a job teaching Australian doctors while he himself could not practise. He is good enough to teach our doctors but, apparently, not good enough to work with them. That kind of inconsistency is ironic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accreditation process, which seems to combine colleges, universities and government recognition through medical tribunals or boards, appears to be neither rational nor logical. You really start to wonder in the new world of GATT whether what we have is really a very complex and sophisticated trade prohibition system. It applies not only to doctors. The situation appears to be similar for engineers, architects and other professionals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments focus on not only the supply of doctors but also the fact that we need to keep modifying, refining and further narrowing our laws to make sure that previously unthought of ways of abusing the system are prevented. One of the disappointing parts of my experience as a parliamentarian is the fact that we spend a lot of our time doing things that should not need to be done. This practice is against the law and these measures should not be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that we have had to come up with these amendments to prevent something that is illegal in the first place is a poor reflection on the medical community. I urge the medical community to look to that and to stop this perception coming through&mdash;while not on a regular basis it is not on an occasional basis either&mdash;that if there is a loophole available to the profession, the profession will use it. The profession needs to come out very strongly in support of these kinds of changes to make sure that they are seen to be putting some professional responsibility on their members to observe the laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is similar, in a way, to the question of the definition of consultants and specialists. We now have to more accurately define physicians who, effectively, always were and always have been specialists. They have a postgraduate qualification. They belong to a college of some form or other, whether it is the college of physicians or whatever. They are, by their nature, postgraduates practising specialist medicine. The fact that we have to define that further is indicative of a system in which one would have thought the normal meaning of words is applicable. I suspect lawyers and others come into play, who then redefine these words for us so that we have to come back and legislate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the depressing aspects of this debate&mdash;and it has happened now on a number occasions when I have spoken about health legislation, which is usually introduced by my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), who does an able job in that way&mdash;is that I remember making some remarks a few months back about the preponderance of some of our members of parliament from the far western state to use these amendments to health legislation to personally vilify and attack the minister responsible for that portfolio. That has occurred again today. It does them no credit and it certainly does this House no credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all stand by and watch with some disturbance huge amounts of taxpayers' money from Western Australia&mdash;a supposedly poor state&mdash;being squandered in this way. Whenever we are over there talking to Western Australians, we are constantly being told how they are underprovided for and how they need more money and more resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had hearings in Western Australia last week and have had public hearings there on other matters, particularly in the social policy area. I have been harassed by Western Australian ministers at these inquiries as to how the Commonwealth does not give them enough money for their needs and so on. To find them squandering it on the kinds of political witch-hunts they have had while at the same time lecturing and heckling us is more than galling. Watching that earlier today seems to reinforce the cynicism so many of us have about the bona fides of those on the other side from the far west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are a small but important part of the health portfolio. Those portfolio responsibilities are being carried out without a diminution of any form at all. I think the snide remarks by the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), at the very start of the debate, somehow suggesting that it was normal for the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to move these amendments, is, as he knows, not just churlish but also wrong because it has not been the case at all in this session of parliament. Certainly since Dr Lawrence has been the minister she has not moved amendments of this nature. He knows that. It might sound good and it might look good to a person who does not know. That is playing games which, in so many ways, demeans not only his position but also the position of those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that these amendments are not being opposed indicates that in some areas those on both sides of the chamber agree. Unlike some of my colleagues, I am quite pleased that the Liberal and National parties do not produce policies. I happen to think that is very good. Six months ago there was a fair amount of sympathy for, if you like, the bleakness of their position. They were regarded generally as a bunch of losers with one more loss coming. Because of that, the public at large lowered their expectations and were very supportive and helpful to the stage of saying, `Don't get policies. We don't mind. It is good tactics, good politics.' That was the case up until about one month ago. I suspect the Queensland election was probably the turning point before which the absence of policies was seen to be a virtue. That virtue was quite comforting for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my point of view, whilst ever those opposite see that as a virtue and keep seeing that as a virtue from now on, they have not realised that for at least the last month, if not longer, the community at large is finding it a bit more difficult to accept a party without any policies as an alternative government. It might have been a good stunt for a while back in April and May, but what was a good stunt then is now becoming a handicap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that by the time they realise that is the case and by the time they get around to producing policies, it will be too late. That virtue, which is now fading and will be reversed in another month or so, will be a massive handicap. Any policy to come out after that will be seen to be too little too late and will attract the kind of cynicism that their initial stance had. </PARA>

It makes it a bit hard to have a debate when we have this ephemeral, phantom fog from those opposite. They do not actually have a position.

In government, especially in times of difficulty with respect to the overall total budget of the Commonwealth, difficult decisions have to be taken.

I am in a position to say that I have had the matter checked out by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and can give an undertaking that the government will monitor the impact and report back to the House in due course if the impact is in some way negative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with some of the arguments that were raised. In particular, I want to thank the opposition for its encouragement and support on the moonlighting issue. Obviously, all of us here are concerned with this issue; we want to ensure that, when certain overseas doctors are given a privilege, as this is&mdash;that is, to practise under certain conditions, either in certain specified hospitals or in certain remote or rural areas, and to be given that privilege because they are being admitted not into the general Australian medical system but only specifically to perform these tasks&mdash;that they are aware that we expect them to perform those tasks and not abuse that privilege. In that sense, therefore, it is very important that we do have these new provisions, and I am pleased that everyone in this chamber who spoke today appreciates and accepts that point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is moving in some directions on this, as I will explain in a minute. But, in relation to the comments made by the member for O'Connor that somehow this matter had something to do with the absence of a co-payment in the Medicare schedule, that really is stretching credulity. What I think he was suggesting was that somehow, because doctors in the cities are able to get access to the Medicare system, that was the reason they were not interested in going to work in country areas. I think that is a big, tortured sort of argument. I am not sure what the point of it is, as doctors in the country are also able to draw Medicare. Therefore, I do not understand the suggestion that the availability of free medical services in the cities somehow counts against doctors working in the countryside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that we have a problem, a complex problem. It concerns the expectations of doctors about support services, their lifestyles and families&mdash;such as the education of their children, et cetera. There is a whole range of issues as to why doctors feel restrained about going to country areas and why they are not as willing to go to the countryside as they are to the cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the apparent suggestions on this point actually do not work so, unless we concentrate our minds on trying to find a solution that makes sense in sociological terms on this, we will not resolve it. I can say on behalf of myself and the minister that we are open to any suggestion from any member who thinks they have ways and means in which they may be able to confront and deal with this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One suggestion has been that we reserve Medicare numbers for specific regions&mdash;that is, a doctor be asked to work only in a particular area, for example, a rural area or a remote area&mdash;and that people should not be able to claim the Medicare levy unless they actually work in that area. That proposal has some attractions but again has difficulties, including possible constitutional difficulties, in relation to the requirement that doctors not be conscripted. With every approach on this matter there are problems. All I am saying is that I welcome members making suggestions, and I am happy to take them up and look into them further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that what we have to do is create more of a culture of incentives for doctors to work in country and remote areas&mdash;and that is probably a profitable way to think about it&mdash;and perhaps further discussions ought to be held with the states and with local authorities about ways and means in which we can progress that incentives approach. Again, we are conscious that this is a problem, and we want to resolve it. I just want to reassure the House about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of the debate, some general issues were raised about pharmaceuticals&mdash;issues about the general costs of pharmaceuticals and about why some pharmaceuticals are restricted and others are not. We have canvassed these issues before in this House, but I repeat that the government has put into place a number of pieces of legislation to try to deal with this issue&mdash;in particular, the equivalence principle which was put forward, where doctors and chemists can now make available quite quickly alternative equivalent drugs that are on the PBS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where some doctors are prescribing a drug which is not on the PBS when they know there is an equivalent drug on the PBS. We have tried to point out to the AMA and others that the doctors should, especially in cases where they are dealing with poor people who cannot afford to have a drug that is not on the PBS, be prescribing the PBS drug when it is equivalent. Some of them are not doing this. We have put into place a new regime now which makes it much easier for pharmacists to substitute a drug which is equivalent in cases where the doctor simply prescribes a drug that is not on the PBS system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have tried to deal with that, but everyone has to understand that the costs of the PBS system are increasing all the time and that we, as a nation, have to take control of this issue. We cannot allow for an indefinite and huge blow-out of the cost of pharmaceuticals. We have to have some controls in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be interested to hear&mdash;because I know that the opposition from time to time raise this issue and say that something ought to be done&mdash;what suggestions they have as to how we can have both controls on the blow-out of the costs of the pharmaceutical system and also&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general revenue assistance to the states and territories for the 1995-96 financial year, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers Conference of 11 April 1995. The April 1995 Premiers Conference was held in conjunction with the Council of Australian Governments meeting which agreed to a program for the implementation of the national competition policy and related reforms and to an associated set of financial arrangements. The central elements of the national competition policy were incorporated in the Competition Policy Reform Act 1995, which received royal assent on 20 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994. The existing act currently covers the provision of general revenue assistance for 1994-95 only, with interim arrangements for continuing payments to a maximum of six months. The bill extends the provision of the existing act for a further 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general revenue assistance for the states and the territories to be appropriated by the bill is estimated to be almost $15.7 billion, or around 12.7 per cent of estimated Commonwealth budget outlays in 1995-96. Accordingly, these payments constitute a significant element of the Commonwealth budget and, in combination with the Loan Council allocations for borrowings by all levels of government agreed to at the April 1995 Loan Council meeting, have an important bearing on the spending and borrowing of the public sector as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995 Premiers Conference reaffirmed the continuation of the real per capita guarantee for the indexation of financial assistance grants to the states and territories in 1995-96. The real per capita guarantee was made to the states at the 1994 Premiers Conference for the three-year period to 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments held in conjunction with the 1995 Premiers Conference the Commonwealth agreed to extend the guarantee to 1997-98 and thereafter on a rolling three-year basis. The provision of the rolling three-year real per capita guarantee reflected the Commonwealth's desire to foster cooperative Commonwealth-state relations, which would, in turn, offer a sound basis for working together to progress micro-economic reform. The Commonwealth recognised that this would best be achieved through provision of a degree of certainty for the states about the level of funding they could expect from the Commonwealth over the medium term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major part of the assistance provided under this bill is the provision to each state and territory of a share of the pool of financial assistance grants, which is estimated to be around $14.9 billion in 1995-96. The 1995 Premiers Conference agreed that the distribution of this assistance should be in accordance with the per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on general revenue grant relativities: 1995 update</EMPHASIS> and estimates of state and territory populations as at 31 December 1995 as determined by the Australian Statistician. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill authorises the payment of special revenue assistance to the states in 1995-96, estimated at $437 million. Of this amount, $412 million relates to payments to New South Wales and Victoria under the guarantee arrangements associated with the Medicare agreements. The Commonwealth will fund $58.9 million of these payments and the residual will be funded from the financial assistance grants pool. The remaining special revenue assistance relates to pool-funded special revenue assistance for the territories. The Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory will receive $15 million and $10 million respectively in order to ease their transition to state-like funding levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Capital Territory will also receive $49.1 million in the form of Commonwealth funded transitional allowances and special fiscal needs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995-96 the government will provide an estimated $369 million in identified arterial road grants to the states and territories. In accordance with the agreement reached at the 1995 Premiers Conference, in each of 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98, one-third of identified road grants will be cumulatively distributed on the basis of the Commonwealth Grants Commission's relativities which underlie the distribution of financial assistance grants. Thus, in 1997-98 identified road grants will be fully distributed on the basis of the relativities underlying financial assistance grants. Until then, that part of identified road grants not distributed on the basis of the Commonwealth Grants Commission's relativities will continue to be distributed on the basis of the 1994-95 shares.

<PARA>Last evening in the old Parliament House we received a splendid speech by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Jeff Kennett, talking about the inadequacies of the workings of our federal system under the current Labor government. I think it is important right at the outset to make a distinction between the attitude that this Labor government has to the concept of federalism, which is coercive federalism, and the difference we as a coalition have to a cooperative, working federalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth while remembering that when Mr Hawke was the Prime Minister he was engaged in discussions with the premiers about having some reforms made to the workings of the federal system. Indeed, Mr Keating used that as part of his methods of undermining the then Prime Minister to usurp the power that was then Mr Hawke's. So Mr Keating is very much on the record as a centralist, a man who does not want to see power sharing, which is inherent in a working federalism, but indeed wants to dictate the terms upon which money is spent when it is allocated by bills such as this to the states to take their share of revenue raised by way of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of the most intriguing phrases, captivating phrases, in the federalism debate are vertical fiscal imbalance and horizontal fiscal equalisation. Catchcries, I said. The first means that the federal government raises the money which state governments need to spend. The second means that there is an agreement in place which allows those states which are richer and more prosperous to have some of the money that would otherwise come to them shared with what had become known as mendicant states&mdash;states that need additional finance, they say, in order to provide services which are equal with those provided in the larger states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a philosophical point of view, our commitment to federalism I think is best expressed in words of someone like Daniel J. Elizar, a federalist who has been working on federalist theory and I think expresses it well. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federalism is a way of linking individuals, groups and polities in a lasting but limited union in such a way as to provide for the energetic pursuit of common ends whilst maintaining the respective integrity of all parties.</PARA>
<PARA>And:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The means to accommodate the desires of people to preserve the intimacy of small societies and the growing necessity for larger combinations to mobilise the utilisation of common resources in a more efficient way.</PARA>
<PARA>The question is: does this bill in fact address any of the problems that are inherent in the way the government treats our states? The answer is a resounding no. I think it is important to look at the realities of the way in which the Commonwealth has in fact increased its own purpose grants at the expense of the states, which once again are squeezed and have to fall back on their own tax base, which is always one which has drawbacks for the economy of the whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the most salient points. Firstly, the total level of general revenue assistance is estimated to total $15.074 billion in 1994-95 and $15.713 billion in 1995-96. In nominal terms, this represents an increase of 4.2 per cent on the previous year. But in real terms there would be no increase at all if inflation runs at three per cent and the population increases about 1.2 per cent. It is important to note that the Commonwealth has raised its own purpose outlays from $81.988 billion in 1993-94 to $88.092 billion in 1994-95. That is an increase of $6.1 billion, representing a nominal increase of seven per cent. If the 1993-94 figure is adjusted for inflation in 1994-95 of 4.5, the own purpose outlays of the Commonwealth increased in real terms by 2.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The past decade has witnessed a dramatic decline in the payments by the Commonwealth to the state and territory governments. The Commonwealth government's own purpose outlays, as a proportion of total budget outlays, have increased by 11 per cent, rising from 66.8 per cent in 1983-84 to 74.2 per cent in 1995-96&mdash;an increase of very large proportions indeed. This is contrasted by a 22 per cent fall in the total payments to the states and territories as a proportion of Commonwealth government budget outlays, falling from 33.1 per cent to an estimated 25.6 per cent for the same period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the vertical fiscal imbalance between the states and the Commonwealth is being enhanced by the abuse of section 96&mdash;tied grants. From 1983-84 to the present day, the level of tied grants has increased by over 37 per cent, from the figure of 38.8 per cent in 1983-84 to an estimated 53.3 per cent in 1995-96. It will be seen that Commonwealth taxation revenue is projected to increase from $105.304 billion in 1994-95 to $119.261 billion in 1995-96, registering an increase of $13.957 billion. In other words, the Commonwealth is going to get $14 billion extra. On the other hand, the net grants to the states are projected to increase from $30.322 billion in 1994-95 to $31.701 billion in 1995-96, registering an increase of a paltry $1.379 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am giving the exact figures because I think it is important to know that again and again since this government took office it has pressured and squeezed the states and taken more and more of the net proceeds that come to it by way of taxation and spent them to make more and more Australians dependent on the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional revenue of $13.959 billion is to be raised by the Commonwealth but, as I said, only $1.379 billion, or 9.8 per cent, will be passed on to the states by way of net grants. It will also be seen that the increase in gross grants of $1.586 billion is made up of increases in tied grants of just over $1 billion and untied grants of a mere $555 million. Thus, approximately 65 per cent of the increase in grants to the states is made up of tied grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the way that that operates in practical terms. Let us look at HACC funding. HACC funding over the years has been a very good example of the way the federal government tries to direct states in the way they shall spend the money allocated to them. Very often the federal government works a pea and thimble trick. It makes an announcement to the Australian people at large saying, `We are going to make $X million available to state governments to spend on additional HACC funding.' But the tag line is that it can only be made available if the states match it dollar for dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funny thing though, the state governments have already made their forward budgeting arrangements and that means that, if they are to match that grant dollar for dollar, in order to get the extra money they have to cut funding in some other way. So, by tying the grants, the federal government is able to direct policy that is decided upon by the state governments. We have state governments because they are closer to the people. They are not bunkered down here in Canberra trying to second-guess what the needs of a state are, determined to exercise centralist control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the Commonwealth is tightening its central control over the states by diminishing their ability to raise revenue and, at the same time, removing the flexibility the states require to organise their own affairs, having regard to local conditions in the spirit of true federalism, by increasing tied grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, if we take a look at the states grants bill, what we are seeing is a bill that provides for general revenue assistance to the states and territories for 1995-96, for an estimated payment to the states and territories, of $15.6 billion for 1995-96. Specifically, the bill amends the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994 to give effect to agreements made at the Premiers Conference on 11 April 1995 regarding the provision of general revenue assistance for the states and territories in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An additional schedule to the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994 is provided. There is an adoption of the per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its report on general revenue grant relativities of the 1995 update to determine the 1995-96 distribution of the pool of financial assistance grants and hospital funding grants. The bill also provides for the amendment of the States Grants (General Purposes) Act to allow for the implementation of the decision of the Premiers Conference so that the method of distributing the arterial road grants level will increase in line with the consumer price index and population growth, in the same manner as financial assistance grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial assistance grants are those grants which are used by state and territory governments for whatever purposes the recipient states choose. They are not attributed to a particular function and give no special revenue assistance; they are, therefore, called `untied grants'. Currently, the main form of general revenue assistance is through financial assistance grants, as estimated in the figures I quoted before. The distribution of FAGs&mdash;as they are colloquially known among the states&mdash;reflects a decision of the Premiers Conference that it should be based on the states' populations as at 31 December each year and per capita relativities assessed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to the category of special revenue assistance grants. These are once-off general revenue assistance, provided by the Commonwealth to a state which is suffering particular budgetary distress from any of a variety of causes, including the adoption of new relativity tables. This assistance is meant to supplement the basic general revenue assistance provided to the state in the form of financial assistance grants. Examples of special revenue assistance grants include Medicare guarantee payments, special and transitional allowances for the ACT and one-off special revenue assistance amounts for various states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the 1995 Premiers Conference, it was agreed that special revenue totalling $486 million would be provided to selected states for the current financial year. The Medicare guarantee payments, which form part of the specific revenue assistance grants, form a part of this grant. It was decided at the 1995 Premiers Conference that New South Wales and Victoria would receive Medicare guarantee payments of $181 million for New South Wales and $230 million for Victoria. However, the Commonwealth will only add an additional sum to the overall pool, previously made available, of $58.9 million. The remaining parts of the grants are deducted from the financial assistance grants pool. Again, you see a pea and thimble trick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come to the important questions of identified road grants and the manner in which arterial road grants are to be treated from now on. There was agreement that those grants would be untied. There was agreement that they would remain identified for a period of three years, then would become part of the general assistance grants and would no longer be identified. So, by agreement, the state governments have indeed managed to untie some of the federal government's oversight of the way in which they administer their states. Now it is up to the people in the various states to make sure those state governments are accountable for the ways in which those grant monies are allocated to roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the overall and most important aspect of this bill is that, yet again, we see the government taking the greedy share and the states being squeezed. We see that there is a figure&mdash;which, no doubt, will be quoted by the government&mdash;naming an increase of 4.2 per cent on the previous year. But the real bottom line is very simple: the amount of tax collected by the Commonwealth government has increased, and the Commonwealth government will keep the greater share and not allow the states to benefit from productivity of the people who live in those states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In every instance, there is a centralist, doctrinaire approach from this Labor, collectivist Commonwealth government, as opposed to a government that is interested in seeing a cooperative federal system. Last night, in his address, Jeff Kennett highlighted many of the aspects that need to be addressed in our federal system to make it a cooperative system&mdash;such as we will introduce&mdash;as distinct from the coercive one that is in place under a Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My starting point is to question several aspects of the Grants Commission's charter and methodology. My reference point is the social justice goal of greater locational and regional equity in Australia. The quality of life for many Australians depends more on where they live than on how much they earn. Lifestyle and location have a fundamental impact on the capability of individuals to acquire new economic and social skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Postcodes determine lifestyles and life chances, far more than technology: identify someone's postcode and a fair estimate can be made of his or her educational background and prospects for satisfying work.</PARA>
<PARA>The internationalisation of the Australian economy has, in many respects, aggravated this trend. The restructuring of urban form and settlement now lags well behind the pace of capital movement and economic restructuring in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clearest example of this process has been the decline of employment opportunities in public housing estates in outer metropolitan areas. Their original purpose and access to blue-collar, tariff-protected work in the manufacturing sector has been broken down by changes in the nature of work and economic competition. While in the 1950s in Australia 80 per cent of public housing households had one or more persons in work, this proportion has now fallen to 15 per cent. The correlation between cheap suburban housing and the lowest paid and skilled parts of the labour force has always been strong in our major cities. A major policy task for government is to devise new interventions by which communities can cope with the demands of an internationalised economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, Barry Jones's link between postcodes and life chances is a little more complex: increasingly, material benefits and lifestyles are being determined by a person's contribution to internationally exposed production processes. High incomes bring with them access to high cost housing areas and also a high propensity for outsourcing household consumption. In this fashion, high skill and high productivity labour markets and locations enjoy a cycle of high income, high consumption and high employment. By contrast, low skill and low productivity labour markets and locations are locked into a cycle of low consumption and low employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the double jeopardy affecting areas like central western Sydney and the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne: postcodes and people with poor access to internationally competitive industries and employment and, consequently, low incomes, low consumption and inadequate generation of jobs in the non-traded sector. For policy makers, this represents a deficiency in aggregate demand and the necessity for new forms of government intervention on the demand side of the labour market. For Keynesians, demand management and pump priming are finding new relevance on a regional scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effectively, the link between urban planning and economic planning in Australia has been broken. Governments can no longer plan patterns of urban and regional settlement fixed against predictable movements in investment and employment. The age old demand for `better planning' in itself can no longer narrow the gap between location and economic and social opportunities. Quite simply, only government and more government intervention can close the gap; not intervention to reregulate and replan industry, but intervention to re-equip and reskill disadvantaged individuals so that they can more effectively meet the demands of a post-industrial society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These issues fundamentally challenge the charter and rationale by which Commonwealth grants are distributed to the states and territories. State boundaries&mdash;lines drawn in at Whitehall during the reign of Queen Victoria&mdash;have shown themselves to be an irrelevant guide to locational inequality in Australia in the 1990s. The states and territories are an industrial age institution, well suited to an era of fixed capital and relatively immobile populations. In the 1990s, economic space and activity have shifted to a national and international level. The notion of separate state and territory economies, no matter what the member for Mackellar thinks, has long since passed and only lingers now for the sake of statistical convenience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key interaction with the new economic space, national and international, comes through local and regional labour markets. This represents a dichotomy in the work of modern government: how, on the one hand, to modify national policies and form international alliances to cope with rapid movements in international capital and, on the other hand, to equip local and regional labour markets with new sources of competitive advantage. It is self-evident that state based systems of funding are not the best and most efficient means for achieving either goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This highlights two basic dilemmas in the functions of modern politics: the disjuncture between, first, fixed structures of government and increasingly dynamic processes of economic and social change; and, second, the local nature of politics, yet capital movements on an international scale. Reformers in Australia have no choice but to accept the fixed structure of our federal system of government. No-one can envisage a majority of electors in each state voting to abolish their state, as required by the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task for reformers, therefore, is to improve the processes and outcomes of the federal system. This may not be as difficult as people on our side of the House and our side of politics have long assumed. The Australian Labor Party, at least since the advent of Whitlam's leadership in the 1960s, has argued for the regionalisation of basic services. Virtually without public comment or recognition, not even by the member for Mackellar, regions have become a feature of state administrative arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia now has a form of regional government, albeit under the control of state governments. This can be seen in the range of state services administered by regional authorities, in school education, electricity and water distribution, public housing, health management, economic development boards, road funding and the police. In one of the striking ironies of Australian politics, the advocates of states rights are actually running their states on a regional basis&mdash;and that includes Jeffrey Kennett. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most states have embraced the managerial style of government based on corporatisation and other private sector principles. Mainstream political issues of growth and resource distribution have fallen off their agenda. State governments have taken on the role of clearing houses for service delivery at a regional level. Just as much, states rights have declined as a political force. With improvements in transport and communications, Australia is now a more compact and secure society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stock in trade of conservative politics since federation&mdash;particularly from West Australians&mdash;exploiting fears about Australia's isolation and the tyranny of distance through issues such as protectionism, White Australia, the communist bogey, monarchism and states rights has just about exhausted itself. This leaves open an emerging agenda for national standards of access and regional equity. It also creates an opportunity for more reasonable federal-state relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government can have confidence in state administrations if the delivery of services is regionalised and federal grants are linked to goals for service universality and affordability, locational equity and output based performance measures. Advances in information technology and output measurement now mean that the federal government does not need to physically provide a service to determine its public impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the means, for instance, by which the Commonwealth-state housing agreement is presently being renegotiated, with a focus on minimum standards, output targets and a federal role in monitoring performance. This approach also featured in the 1994 ALP National Conference decision to develop benchmarks in key areas of social policy such as housing, health and education. It also offers inspiration for finalising COAG's agenda for the integration of health and child-care service delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Our federal system would be much more effective if the Commonwealth took responsibility for economic institutions and national infrastructure, with the states transferring their powers in industrial relations, business regulation, consumer affairs and ports. Just as much, the states and their local government authorities should be encouraged to administer the delivery of human services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to specific flaws in the methodology of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. In particular, I refer you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and honourable members to the outstanding report on horizontal fiscal equalisation prepared by the heads of Treasury's working party to the 1994 Premiers Conference. At the conclusion of my remarks I will be seeking leave to include two tables from that report which demonstrate the impact of fiscal equalisation in Australia in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Grants Commission, of course, is concerned with equalising the capacity of state governments to provide state-like services, taking into account each state's own revenue raising capacity. The working party report identified five basic problems with the commission's methodology. First, fiscal equalisation is about capacity to provide services, not actual provision. No account can be taken of the efficiency or inefficiency of each state government in service delivery. In some cases, inefficiency runs down capacity and it is very difficult for the commission to avoid the distribution of grants which in practice reward inefficiency. In 1993, the Centre for Policy Studies estimated that moving to a system of revenue equalisation would increase national GDP by about 0.22 per cent, while moving to equal per capita assessment would increase GDP by 0.23 per cent&mdash;an aggregated gain in national output of approximately $2 billion per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second methodology flaw identified in the report is the way in which revenue raising capacity is based on what each state could raise by applying the average of all states tax policies. Given the complexities of tax policy and revenue raising goals, a system of averaging is obviously quite crude and can produce perverse outcomes. I noted earlier that the member for Mackellar was talking about the financial position of the states and complaining about the degree of federal financial assistance. I think it is very important in this debate and in response to those remarks to note that many of the financial difficulties of the states are the result of their own discretionary tax decisions, decisions they have made as sovereign governments, as a tier of government, to run down their own tax base. For instance, in my own state of New South Wales the abolition of payroll tax exemptions would raise an additional $500 million, but the government there, by its own choice, its own discretion, has decided to offer that amount to business for employment purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states do have at their disposal means by which they can improve their own revenue base. I will also seek leave to incorporate a table which outlines the degree of tax discounting in each of the six states and two territories. This shows the way in which the states have made discretionary decisions to run down their revenue base. Of course, in their complaints and those of the member for Mackellar we never hear about the extra federal responsibilities which are in fact now saving the states money: the funding for TAFE and labour market training, the responsibilities the federal government has picked up in child care, in housing, for recurrent funding and new capital stock, in the provision of infrastructure tax bonds, which enable the states to transfer much of their infrastructure expenditure to the private sector. We also never hear about the way in which state governments are actively cost shifting in the health sector, pushing additional costs onto the federal budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third flaw in methodology concerns some of the commission's judgments, because by their very nature they are quite subjective. For instance, there is the difficulty the commission has in differentiating between policy and non-policy factors that affect the fiscal capacity of the states. Another instance is that the cost disability assessment from diseconomies of scale in state administration, in the absence of quality data, relies heavily on the commission's own subjective judgments, and this results in the redistribution of general revenue grants of around $440 million each year away from New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland in favour of other states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth flaw concerns time lags in the collection of data and the adjustment of relativities. This means that each year's grants do not necessarily reflect each year's circumstances. With an increasingly dynamic economy and set of social changes, it should be a real concern that the time lag in the development of the data and application of the relativities can reflect conditions that applied between two and six years ago. The time lag is quite substantial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth flaw that the working party report identified is that the commission only assesses the recurrent expenditures of the states. Capital expenditures are not considered, nor are commercial operations, promotional activities or the circumstances of local government in each state. So this is very much horizontal fiscal equalisation based on partial criteria. Also omitted in the assessment are the private infrastructure partnerships the state governments are now engaging in, and these projects, of course, push costs onto consumers rather than state taxpayers. The people, be they consumers or taxpayers, are still paying. Yet this method of moving basic state functions such as roads and electricity generation into the private sector is not being accounted for by the Grants Commission. It should be included in their assessment. It is not surprising that there was no allowance for these private and public partnerships when the Grants Commission was established back in 1933. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the answer that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) provided to my question on notice. He answered on 28 March 1995 in relation to those private infrastructure projects and I think there remains a very strong argument to have those issues assessed actively by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to some of the objections that I would raise to the methodology of the commission. My primary objection, and I mentioned this earlier, is that the current criteria reflect a poor means of distributing funds to address the real source of locational inequality in Australia. State based funding cannot effectively, and certainly not in the first instance, address inequities in Australia that by their nature are local and regional. Grants Commission per capita relativities suggest effectively that public needs in Hobart and Darwin are two to six times greater than those in Campbelltown, in my electorate, or in Blacktown in the electorate of the member for Chifley (Mr Price) in western Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional assessment would allow urban areas to be compared against urban areas, and country areas to be compared against country areas. It would be comparing apples with apples instead of the situation we have now where, under the Grants Commission methodology, people in an urban area can benefit disproportionately by virtue of the fact that they live in a smaller, more dispersed state area. State based funding is not relevant to addressing those levels of inequity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote from an excellent article Pru Anderson wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in March last year where she pointed out that the current system of funding feeds political bunfights. She wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people of Wollongong enjoy nothing like the facilities that equalisation has built in Perth. If state boundaries were redrawn to put Bourke into a state of its own then Western Australian taxpayers would be paying out to the people of outback New South Wales. At the same time, equalisation can offer no guarantees to the people of Broome that more of the subsidy spent in Perth will be coming their way. There is no check on the internal state distribution of equalised funding so there is no way of knowing that it is even spent on those services deemed to be most in need.</PARA>
<PARA>My last point is the very worrying development of competitive federalism and the discounting down of state budget positions. This is a new form of protectionism in Australia whereby each of the states competes for investment. They provide direct subsidies. They might do it by pricing or taxing, which I referred to earlier. They might do it through local preference tenders at a cost to their budget. The results are running down state budgets alarmingly and providing less financial capacity for the core services of the state tier of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be noted, and you would appreciate this, Mr Deputy Speaker, that capital is footloose by its very nature in our internationalised economy. The most desperate states, those with the highest rates of unem-</PARA>
<PARA>ployment, will place the largest bids for the investment. This happened recently when Westpac, in the decision to locate its data processing centre, was offered a $30 million subsidy by the South Australian government, and this for a company which is returning multibillion dollar profits. What need does Westpac have, courtesy of the taxpayers in South Australia or any other part of the country, to receive a $30 million subsidy when its profit level is so high?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States this process of competitive federalism is known as smokestack-chasing. Experience there has indicated that the firms move on from one state to another when they are offered an even bigger public subsidy. There was a celebrated case in the United States in 1993 when a Mercedes-Benz plant was up for grabs. Thirty-five states offered 100 different sites. Alabama was the `successful' state as it offered an incentives package estimated at $300 million&mdash;$200,000 for each of the 1,500 expected jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now note that one of the poachers has turned gamekeeper. Mr Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, is suggesting that COAG should draw up rules to prevent this sort of tax discounting&mdash;competitive federalism that damages the public interest. The best idea is to use the Grants Commission to force the states to be more realistic in this process. If they can afford these subsidies then they can afford to lose grants by an equivalent amount. I also want to urge that reform upon the Treasurer in the next review of Commonwealth Grants Commission methodology. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak very briefly on the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1995 and, in particular, the amendment moved by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994 provides financial assistance to states and territories through the provision of grants. It goes without saying that the Commonwealth has a dominant position in the relationship between the two, given that it has greater revenue raising capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I would like to talk on is section 15 of the States Grants (General Purposes) Act. Unfortunately, the government has not seen the light and has refused to repeal this section. This section states that, where a state government has introduced freedom of choice at its universities&mdash;that is, has provided for voluntary membership of student unions&mdash;and a student union has lost membership as a result of this, the federal government will compensate the union with the amount it has lost, with those funds coming from grants to the relevant state. This means that significant amounts of money which would normally go towards the state's essential services will go to student unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funding given to the student unions is determined under the Commonwealth Higher Education Funding Act. As of 4 July 1995, payments to student unions in Western Australia totalled $4,365,062. This was the sum of payments made to Curtin University, the University of Western Australia and Murdoch University. At that date, the Edith Cowan University had requested $1,154,017, of which a quarter had been paid, with the remainder to be paid in the weeks following. So we have around $5 1/2 million being denied Western Australians and redirected to student unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It goes without saying that, in years gone by, student unions have been actively opposed to the coalition. In 1990, they attacked the coalition at every campus in Western Australia and, I imagine, at most other campuses in the nation. During the 1993 election, they again attacked the coalition at every campus in WA and, I imagine, at most campuses throughout the nation. While I do not oppose their right to exercise their political voice and I, in fact, welcome political debate, I am opposed to the funding of them by the taxpayers at the cost of the states, particularly when the states have been given a mandate to legislate for voluntary membership of student unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a massive political audience on university campuses, and this section is a lucrative pay-off to the student unions for the active support that they give the Labor Party. To go back in time, during the 1993 Western Australian election it was coalition policy to introduce voluntary student unionism. The Labor Party opposed this, as did the student unions, which is their right. But, after the student unions supported the Labor Party, it is outrageous that they have been paid off to the tune of $5 1/2 million taxpayer dollars for their support of the Labor Party, and that Western Australia's essential services are denied their essential funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It borders on lawful corruption that the government can introduce legislation to make payments to organisations for the political support they offer, with the funding for the payment coming from states the federal government is politically opposed to. With voluntary student unionism, student unions would be forced to represent their student membership, to maintain its support, or lose it. It is the same with political parties: they must be representative to attract members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the infrastructure behind the student unions, accrued over the years of compulsory membership, they have the facilities, the capability, the know-how and the population to operate successfully and effectively with voluntary membership. Regrettably, this government has taken the Big Brother attitude and is penalising the states for legislating for the mandate they were given. This government would rather penalise the population of the states by depriving them of funding for essential services and diverting that money into pay-offs to the student unions than let democracy take its course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the amendment of the honourable member for Mackellar and urge the government to reconsider its position on section 15. Western Australia needs the $5 1/2 million for essential services, and it is an affront to democracy that the government is riding roughshod over the states by introducing legislation to try to coerce the states into acceding to its philosophical viewpoint, despite the people giving the states a mandate to introduce their legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is typical of the government to adopt this tactic, and it is an outrageous abuse of taxpayers who need the money to improve our roads, to reduce hospital waiting lists and to address the issue of law and order. As long as this section is in place and the government is denying Western Australia the money to do those things, no Labor Party supporter can ever condemn the Western Australian government for not giving more money to those very essential areas. We do have problems with crime, roads and health but the federal Labor government is ignoring these problems by making political pay-offs to its supporters with taxpayers' money which should be going to essential services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time the government found the moral fortitude to repeal section 15, which would force student guilds to earn their members, allow state governments to implement their mandates and, finally, allow the states to spend much needed money on more essential services than student politics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill that is before us is to arrange the provision of general revenue assistance to the states and territories for the 1995-96 financial year. The bill basically goes along with the decision that was made at the Premiers Conference with the heads of government this year. The Commonwealth's commitment to maintain real per capita guarantee of financial assistance while tightening the fiscal policy to help increase the national saving underscores the commitment to Commonwealth-state relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Premiers Conference the states asked for a guarantee of funding to 1997-98 and after that on a three-year rolling basis. This was agreed to, and of course that gives opportunities for the states to forward plan in the area of infrastructure, particularly roads, which I wanted to touch on today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grants in this bill were changed in 1994 to reflect population changes throughout the country. In overall terms, this means that the grants that were distributed on an historical needs basis are now being changed to a per capita basis. In 1995-96, one-third of the grants will be allocated on the new population basis and two-thirds in the old way. In 1996-97, two-thirds will be allocated on a population basis and one-third on the historical needs basis. In 1997-98, the new method of allocation will be completely phased into the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is a need to recognise that for the smaller states with smaller populations&mdash;such as the state that I represent&mdash;some inequities would be created if that system based on population growth were wholeheartedly embraced. A great deal of growth is occurring at present in the northern part of the east coast of Australia, and there is not much growth in some of the southern states, especially in Tasmania. Because we would have been disadvantaged, the Premiers Conference agreed to continue to distribute local government road funding on the basis of the historical share rather than having it absorbed into local government assistance grants and distributed on a per capita basis. Some equality is maintained for the smaller states with the smaller populations by this method of historical share local government road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative to this would have cost Tasmania dearly and would have been particularly detrimental to rural and remote communities, such as many of the ones that I represent in the seat of Lyons. My electorate has thousands of kilometres of roads linking major towns outside the electorate but has only small population centres. If there were any moves to a per capita distribution, it would mean that small councils would be struggling to keep the roads open, let alone maintained, Then, of course, the national highway is funded separately and completely by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently my interest in roads has been heightened, and it is on this area that I wish now to concentrate a few of my comments. I was involved at the start of this parliament, when I came into the parliament, with the report that was brought down by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Driving the road dollar further</EMPHASIS>. It was very good to pick up on the work that the previous committee had done and to be a part of looking at the finalisation of that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was difficult in parts for the previous committee to pull together the hard information of how well money was being spent on roads. We tend to look at how much money is allocated and how much is spent rather than how well it is spent throughout the state systems. I looked around Tasmania and have asked this same question that was being asked by the committee at that time. Although our allocation has been kept in real terms, I do believe that there has been a lot of waste in road construction in the state. The road network is vital to the local and to the national economy. Without decent roads, many communities might as well forget about trying to get the tourist dollar or trying to relocate a niche industry so as to gain another industry in their area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the examples of inefficient planning can be seen in the federal roads system as well. I have recently done a survey of residents in the Westbury-Hagley area, where I believe that the state government had made an unreasonable assessment of an extension for the national highway. The residents basically came back with what I believe makes a most logical line in the marginal adjustment to the local needs in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be a practice in the state in road making to make decisions about purchasing properties and areas that possibly will be needed for road making well before there is a final approval by the two ministers. I think this is a waste of effort and can cause a great deal of confusion and a great deal of waste. There is a need to have planning two or three years out which actually pulls together which direction the highway is going and what planning should be done. It should be agreed to two or three years out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some areas, the national highway funding may only be putting money in a few people's pockets. There seems to be little accountability by the state, nor do performance indicators play a part in the ongoing planning. I believe we need to lift the game on the performance indicators in terms of what we are actually achieving by building more roads and better roads. Just what are we doing? We need to get performance indicators in place so that we can make judgments about that. We could also make judgments about which states are performing better than others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The road to nowhere is a road that is being built to assist the election chances of one of the Liberal state candidates in the north-west. It is a road that joins Smithton to the Pieman River. It is very nice if you want a one-way trip to nowhere, or maybe it is the beginning of a link road to Melbourne&mdash;that is, if there were another ice age! The great township of Balfour, with a population in the holiday periods of about four, is the only town that will benefit from such a highway, and yet I understand that the state government has allocated another $3.5 million to it next financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are mayors in my electorate who are crying out for road funding for their infrastructures. They have been passed over and pushed aside, because this is the strategic area that the state government wants to concentrate on. Allocating funds to building passing lanes on the Tasman Highway or upgrading the Marlborough Highway to allow tourist traffic an alternative route would be far more appropriate than allocating funds to a road to nowhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are lots more examples of the lack of planning and silly allocation of funding in Tasmania by the state road authority. The small community of Levendale has 22 kilometres of unsealed road. This is a community that has been forgotten. The road has never been sealed. People have to drive past the school, the churches and the community hall on a corrugated gravel road which should have been upgraded over the last 10 to 15 years&mdash;but it hasn't been. There does not seem to be any way of convincing the present Minister of Transport and Works in the state to get in behind this community and give it a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lake Highway in the central highlands has also failed to gain the recognition that it deserves. The townships of Bothwell, Deloraine and New Norfolk would gain greatly from some expenditure on this road. Parts of the edges are breaking away and the road has about 35 kilometres of unsealed surface. This area has a growing population that lives in the highlands and the township of Miena and its surrounds. There are also the thousands of visitors who come into this area during the trout season in Tasmania. All this seems to be taking second place to other considerations in roads planning in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to touch on another area that I have been considerably concerned about in relation to road structure and road infrastructure in Tasmania, and that is signage. The signage seems to be sometimes placed in the wrong place. It seems to add to the dangers of transport and travelling in Tasmania. Sometimes the signs are, I believe, placed too late for cars to see. The alternatives are not there. There does not seem to be any acknowledgment that road paving and signage on the road pavement itself can add to the slowing up of some of the traffic as it comes close to country towns or starts to enter the outskirts of those areas. In relation to turn-offs, arrows do not seem to be put on roundabouts. There seems to be just a total lack of coordination or a standard that should be met by the state authority in putting signage in an area so that it meets a certain quality and standard that I am sure should be part of the overall planning of road making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the township of Perth, where my electorate office is, the constant difficulties of getting the schoolchildren across the road have led to a running battle to have an upgraded system to assist the parents and the lady on the crossing. This needs urgent attention. There has been some indication that there will be some attention given to it, but that has not been forthcoming as yet and there has been no indication of when a decision will be made. At Longford there is a roundabout which has claimed many lives. I know the local council there writes to the state minister for roads every time there is another death or major accident, asking for something to be done. The minister has failed to respond to the roundabout at Illawarra Road and Longford. Though there has been some indication that there may be something happening, it has failed to eventuate as yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new rolling funding over three years gives an opportunity to look in the state areas at strategic planning, to look at why we are building roads, at what quality we are building them and at how they fit into the strategic planning of our local and state government and our economic development. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Driving the road dollar further</EMPHASIS> certainly gives us an opportunity and if we read that report we would find there are areas in it that we should certainly be pursuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research and development into road making certainly needs to be looked at. I believe there is a lack of R&amp;D. I believe there are certainly modern ways and new ways of looking at road building and that we are certainly not at world best practice level in Australia. I believe we can lift our game in that area a great deal, as we can in bridge building. I know that the University of Launceston has been doing some work on behalf of the Municipal Association in Tasmania, looking at bridge building using wooden pylons and wooden poles instead of total concrete bridges. There is a situation developing in Tasmania on bridge construction and bridge maintenance in the local municipalities that will need to be addressed some time in the future. They will certainly not be able to meet their obligations on all these bridges, in my opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bridges were passed back to all the local municipalities in Tasmania in the last round of council amalgamations by the state government, with small amounts of money for the municipalities to take them over. The municipalities have taken them over, but with their current rate bases. In my electorate there are some with enormous amounts of infrastructure in bridges and in roads which will find a great deal of difficulty in meeting their obligations to their ratepayers if they do not get some further assistance in maintaining their bridges, putting new surfaces on them and upgrading them generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have an opportunity with this new round of funding to be more innovative, use new skills and get into our planning for strategic regions for building roads. That is why we should be looking further and longer. I believe there should be greater accountability and performance indicators developed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to enter this debate on the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1995. As honourable members would be aware, this bill covers three main areas: firstly, the financial assistance grants; secondly, the special revenue assistance grants; and, thirdly, the identified road grants. As the former speaker, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), has been talking about roads, I might just pick up on roads. I will point out the fact that his concern and complaints about the lack of funding for roads and not really getting on with the job comes back to this federal government. In 1983, when this federal Labor Party came into power, 62 per cent of all road fuel excise was going back to roads. Now we find that only eight per cent is going back to roads. The effect of that is that $5 billion has been syphoned from the motorists of Australia away from road building.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Lyons comes in here saying that the roads are in a terrible state in his electorate in Tasmania in certain areas, but where is the real problem? Where are most taxes raised in Australia? Right here by the federal government. What has the federal Labor Party done over the last 13 years? It has taken the money away from roads. It means there would have been an extra $150 million going into roads in Tasmania if the same level of fuel excise was being returned to roads in Tasmania as it was when the last coalition government was in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is a classic example of the federal government, coming up to the next election, blaming state governments for infrastructure in our community which cannot be afforded. Why? Because the financial assistance grants and the other grants given by the Commonwealth to the states are being cut. That is one of the fundamental problems in Australia at this stage. Grants which go to the states for housing, education, hospitals and roads have been cut. The federal government is saying that everyone has to pull in their belts to get things back in order, but at the same time as they have been telling the states&mdash;and the states have been doing it&mdash;the federal government has been spending more and more money and raising more and more taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to continue talking about roads because the member for Lyons said there is a road building program down the west coast of Tasmania which he regards as the road to nowhere. Let me inform the House that it is a road between very important communities in Tasmania, such as the Smithton community in the north-west of Tasmania. He mentioned the township of Balfour, which he said would have a population of only four in the high tourist season. That may be true, but that is not the main town. It has nothing to do with it, really. It goes between Smithton and Zeehan. These towns have a population of about 5,000 and 2,000. The road will enable Tasmanians, and people who visit Tasmania, to drive right around Tasmania for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the road is through; all that has to be done now is for the gravel to be put on top of it and a couple of bridges put in, one across the Donaldson River and one across another minor river. The punt which goes across the Pieman River is actually being transported either today or tomorrow. It will be one of the most beautiful scenic trips for tourists in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last week I visited one of the tourist accommodation areas in Smithton and talked about this. The operator said, `I already have for the first year 250 busloads, with an average of 40 tourists each, who are ready to come once the road is open.' Labor members are saying, for their own political purposes, that this is a road to nowhere. It is being sought after by hundreds of tourists, if not thousands. So this road will be of great benefit to the tourist industry throughout the state. It goes through some of the most magnificent scenery in Tasmania. I am sure people will really enjoy it when they travel down that road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come back to the main aspect of this funding bill. What we find, as I said, is that overall the Commonwealth government is squeezing the states. This is the essence of what the federal Labor Party has been about&mdash;taking money away from the states, making the states look like they have got no capacity to govern: bring in a republic, do away with state governments, and centralise all power and decision making in Canberra. That is what our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) really wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill indicates how financially there has been a centralising of power. There have been many other pieces of legislation that have come through this parliament which show how in social legislation this government has tried to centralise the power and the decision making here in Canberra. Of course, they even resort to international agreements to take the power away from Australian people in many of these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the financial centralising of power, let me just illustrate the facts. The total level of general revenue assistance is estimated to be $15.04 billion in 1994-95 and $15.713 billion in 1995-96. This is about a 4.2 per cent increase on the previous year. That is for the states. In real terms there is no increase, if you take into account inflation of three per cent and, say, a population increase of around 1.2 per cent&mdash;which are the basic facts. There has been no real increase in state revenue funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the Commonwealth has done. It has raised its own purpose outlays from $81.988 billion in 1993-94 to $88.092 in 1994-95. What does this represent? It represents a nominal increase of seven per cent. If you adjust it for inflation and so on you get a real increase of 2.5 per cent. Here we have it, starting to come out very clearly in billions of dollars, in effect. It only sounds a small amount&mdash;a 2.5 per cent real increase&mdash;but in actual fact it is a $6.1 billion increase in federal funding. But the states, which have to provide for our schools, for the social infrastructure and fabric of this country, do not get any real increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet you will see, coming up to this federal campaign, the federal members of the Labor Party going back to their electorates and saying, `Isn't it terrible, having terrible roads in this state. What is the state government doing about it?' In actual fact, the federal government has ripped $5 billion of fuel excise money out of road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then they will say, `Isn't it terrible. State governments have to cut back on their teachers and funding for schools. The parents are being forced to financially support the schools because the state governments will not fund them.' The fact is that the federal Labor Party is not giving substantial grants to the states to fund their responsibilities and to fund them adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past decade, we have seen a dramatic decline in the payments by the Commonwealth to the state and territory governments. The Commonwealth government's own purpose outlays, as a proportion of the total state and federal budget outlays, have increased by 11 per cent. The federal government's own purpose outlays have increased by 11 per cent, from about 66.8 per cent in 1983-84 to 74 per cent now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage, the actual government outlays in Australia were proportioned two to one&mdash;two by the Commonwealth and one by the states. If you look at the proportion of funding for our government outlays throughout Australia now, it is actually three to one&mdash;the Commonwealth has three parts and the state governments have one part. When you have a look at the one-quarter of expenditure that this measly federal government allows to the state governments in Australia to spend, what does it do? It ties their hands and says, `Yes, this is state government funding, but you can only do this with it.' The government ties the states' hands. It has increasingly done that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is centralising the decision making power back into Canberra. It is cutting the states' funding and complaining to the Australian people that their hospitals are being run down and their schools are being run down because these terrible state governments are cutting the number of public servants, cutting the number of teachers, cutting the number of nurses and cutting the amount of funding to roads. It all comes back to this federal government, which is trying to do away with Australian people in regional Australia and with people in the states having some power over their own lives. I find it such hypocrisy for some of the Labor Party members in here today to complain about what state governments have not been doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that this federal government has no interest in regional Australia. If it did have an interest in regional Australia, it would be allowing people to make decisions at a closer community level. The first level of that is the state governments. It would be funding them; it would be providing them with enough financial assistance to run their schools effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One ought to ask: where has the money been syphoned away to? Where has this $5 billion of fuel excise that should be going into road infrastructure in this nation been going to? Think of the number of employment opportunities there would be if this federal government, under our Prime Minister Keating, put $5 billion extra dollars into infrastructure in our roads. I wonder how many lives would be saved on the Pacific Highway in New South Wales, the lack of funding for which we have heard several members complain about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time our national highway was duplicated right around this country. If the fuel excise was going into that, even at the level of 60 per cent&mdash;which it was when this government took over&mdash;and not the eight per cent that is now going in, we probably would have duplicated highways around Australia. And some of those smaller communities would have bitumen roads out to their communities. The federal member for Lyons spoke a moment ago about a community that does not have that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why hasn't it had it? Because his government will not provide the funding so that the state governments can build the roads. It is an absolute disgrace for the government to be in here complaining about what some of the state governments are doing when, for 10 years, it has been cutting back funding, making it impossible for states to get on with their constitutional responsibilities and do it effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, we see the influence of the federal government on tied grants. Not only does it give the state governments less money and no real increases, when it does give them money it says, `You are going to do A, B, C and D with it or you won't get it.' We saw this authoritarian, dictatorial approach in the Labor Party preselection for Batman. That was the latest example of the Prime Minister's authoritarian approach being stamped on everybody. It is stamped on state governments by taking money away from them. They come to Canberra and are made to beg, as though they were begging for food&mdash;and the Prime Minister loves it. </PARA>

It had to be Martin Ferguson. Oh, no, don't listen to the local people; don't listen to their wishes. We have the Prime Minister stamping his authority and that of the federal government over the wishes and desires of the people of a local community. And we see that authoritarian and out-of-touch government continuing to push its views in such an arrogant way on ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill indicates the lack of desire and lack of interest of this federal government in ensuring that the states and, therefore, individuals and families have adequate funding for social and road infrastructure, which is the role of state governments. Gradually, by stealth, the federal government has been reducing the amount of money able to be spent by state governments while it enhances its own image among the people through its spending largesse at the national level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is no regard to our overseas debt. State governments have to pull in their belts but the federal government can go on a spending spree, putting it on the bankcard, selling off the Commonwealth Bank and other assets. It has not applied to itself the principles it expects state governments to apply. Many state governments over the last two or three years have done excellent jobs in trying to balance their budgets and rein in overspending, their already meagre budgets reduced because of lack of financial assistance through grants from the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill really summarises the nature of this government. It is penny pinching just so it has an extra amount to spend at the federal level while state governments carry the brunt of the people's resentment of governments. Here we see in stark terms the way in which the government has reduced funding for basic infrastructure needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the passage of this bill, but it is very clear that there is continuing financial mismanagement of Commonwealth-state relations. It does not matter how much the government wants to talk about a republic; it is not going to change the way in which Australia should be administered. If this government really wants to provide Australia with a vision, a sense of purpose and a sense of destiny for the future, then it ought to take a good hard look at the concept of dealing honestly with state premiers and the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA>Those elements are hidden away in this bill. It needs to be drawn to the attention of the general public that members of the opposition certainly do not agree with some of the actions of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate has been very broad ranging and has certainly covered a lot of areas. The previous two speakers, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) and the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles)&mdash;ironically, they are both from Tasmania&mdash;highlighted the issue of road funding. How much funding the Commonwealth provides to the states and local government in order to maintain the nation's road network in comparison with the amount of money that is collected from the road users of Australia by the Commonwealth&mdash;which amounts to almost $10 billion&mdash;is a very sore point throughout the nation. A very small percentage of the amount collected from road users is actually allocated to roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that the member for Braddon raised in his contribution, which the government and this parliament need to address, relates to where the balance of the money that is being soaked up by the tax man at the petrol bowser is being spent by the Commonwealth. This is all part of the broader debate on state grants from the Commonwealth and Commonwealth-state relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those issues are really what we are discussing in this debate on the State Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1995. Obviously, the purpose of this bill is to provide for general revenue assistance to the states and territories for 1995-96. As a result of the Commonwealth's dominant position in raising revenue through income tax, the provision of financial assistance to the states and territories through grants is an important element in the financial relationship between governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill gives effect to certain arrangements agreed to at the Premiers Conference in April 1995. One of the decisions agreed to at that conference was the adoption of the per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its report. The Commonwealth Grants Commission calculates the relativity factor by asking what level of expenditure would be required to provide a standard level of service, assuming average levels of efficiency in delivery and administration. This is a very important element in the overall equation of how untied grants are provided&mdash;that is what we are discussing here today&mdash;as opposed to how special purpose payments or tied grants are provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in this bill there is special revenue assistance of $15 million to the Australian Capital Territory and $10 million to the Northern Territory as a transitional arrangement in getting them up to speed with the other states. It is interesting to note the power that the Commonwealth has as far as raising revenue and the distribution of that revenue back through the federal system is concerned. We still have that in this nation; it started back in the early parts of this century. I suppose the constitution and the federal system that evolved were a compromise because at that stage the states were coming together to form a Commonwealth, to form a federal system, and they compromised in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been noted from different observers over the years that there are get-out clauses within the constitution which have allowed the development of practices that are detrimental to our overall advancement. These have allowed the Commonwealth to enjoy overriding powers that are not always applied for the national benefit but simply to pursue political ends. On that, the Commonwealth exploits, for all it is worth, its financial relations with the states. In a 1962 lecture about problems of management in a federation, which is basically what we are debating today&mdash;the problems of financial management in the federation of Australia&mdash;Sir Robert Menzies noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The constitution gave the Commonwealth power over taxation but not so as to discriminate between states or parts of states. However, the Commonwealth finds the capacity to give discriminating help to individual states via section 96 which allows it to grant financial assistance to any state on such terms and conditions as the parliament thinks fit.</PARA>
<PARA>Who controls the parliament?  The government of the day because it has the numbers in the parliament. Menzies commented in that 1962 lecture:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now a perceived view that the Commonwealth is unrestricted as to the terms and conditions it imposes.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing, I believe, has changed since then. The government of the day is unrestricted as to how it can direct the funds through to the states. We have seen growth in special purpose payments, in tied grants, which the Commonwealth or the government of the day issues&mdash;a little later on I will highlight that&mdash;with the amount of money which is being distributed to different sources throughout the states via special purpose payments rather than untied grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the bill for a minute, according to the EM the arrangements established by this bill provide for an estimated payment to the states and territories of $15.6 billion in 1995-96. That is by way of untied grants. That is via three areas&mdash;financial assistance grants, special revenue assistance grants and identified road grants. As I said, a number of previous speakers have spent a considerable amount of time talking about the roads grants. There is a lack of funding emanating from the Commonwealth through different means, whether to the states or local government. In the Commonwealth's budget there is a discrepancy between the amount of money that is being spent on roads compared with the amount of money that is being collected from road users throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I got the bill and the explanatory memorandum to have a look at how the figures are established. I think one of the earlier speakers alluded to the vertical fiscal equalisation program and a horizontal program as well and the means by which these figures are arrived at. In relation to the arterial roads grant, the bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"10(1) Subject to this Act, each State is to be paid, by way of financial assistance, in relation to the grant year commencing on 1 July 1994, an amount set out in Schedule 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"(2) Subject to this Act, each State is to be paid, by way of financial assistance, in relation to a grant year, other than the grant year commencing on 1 July 1994, an amount worked out in accordance with the applicable Schedule.".</PARA>
<PARA>The applicable schedule is in the EM&mdash;schedule 2. Section 10 of the bill, arterial roads grants, provides that each state is entitled to additional funding by way of arterial roads grants, as specified in the schedule. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 10 of the Act provides that each State is entitled to additional funding by way of arterial roads grants as specified in the schedule. In 1994-95 these were fixed amounts for each State. As of 1 July 1995, these amounts are to be indexed in line with the growth in FAGs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to Section 10 specify that while each State in 1994-95 is entitled to the fixed amount as specified in Schedule 1, the 1995-96 entitlement will be fixed by the formula specified in Schedule 2.</PARA>
<PARA>That is rather interesting in itself. The amounts of arterial roads grants payable to the states under subsection 10(2) are to be worked out using the formula. The formula is the base amount, times the index factor, times the population factor, times one-third, times the adjusted state population divided by the adjusted total population, plus the base amount, times the index factor, times the population factor, times two-thirds, times the historic share. Joe Average out in the street would not have a hope in Hades of understanding those calculations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the base amounts that are worked off at the start of that equation. For New South Wales, it is $158 million-odd, for Victoria it is $207 million-odd and for Queensland it is $38 million-odd. The financial assistance grants are calculated in relation to the grant year, an amount worked out using the formula: the base amount, times the index factor, times the population factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Good as that is in the work the bureaucrats and the department have done to try to balance things out across Australia, if you look at what is being paid compared with what was paid in real terms, you see that the total level of general revenue assistance is estimated to total $15 billion-odd in 1994-95 and $15.7 billion-odd in 1995-96. In nominal terms, this represents an increase of 4.2 per cent on previous years. In real terms, there would be no increase if inflation runs at three per cent and the population increase is 1.2 per cent. There is no real increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be noted that the Commonwealth has raised its own purpose outlays from $81.988 billion in 1993-94 to $88.092 billion in 1994-95. This is an increase of $6.1 billion, representing a nominal increase of seven per cent. If the 1993-94 figure is adjusted for inflation in 1994-95 at 4.5 per cent, the own purpose outlays of the Commonwealth increase by 2.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The past decade has witnessed a dramatic decline in the payments by the Commonwealth to the state and territory governments. Commonwealth government own purpose outlays as a proportion of total budget outlays have increased by 11 per cent, rising from 66.8 per cent in 1983-84 when the current government came to power to 74.2 per cent in 1995-96. This is contrasted by a fall of 22 per cent in total payments to the states and territories as a proportion of Commonwealth budget outlays from 33.1 per cent to an estimated 25.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1983-84 to the present day, the level of tied grants has increased by over 37 per cent&mdash;those are the specific purpose payments&mdash;from 38 per cent in 1983-84 to 53.3 per cent in 1995-96. The Commonwealth taxation revenue is projected to increase from $105.3 billion in 1994-95 to $119 billion in 1995-96, registering an increase of $13.9 billion. On the other hand, the total of net grants to the states is projected to increase from $30.3 billion in 1994-95 to only $31.7 billion in 1995-96, registering an increase of only $1.3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question should be asked: is this fiscal equalisation? Thus, of the additional taxation revenue of $13.9 billion being collected by the Commonwealth in 1995-96, only $1.37 billion, or 9.8 per cent, will be passed on to the states by way of net grants. It will also be seen that the increase in gross grants of $1.58 billion is made up of increases of tied grants of a little over $1 billion and of untied grants of only half a billion dollars&mdash;that is, $555 million. Thus, approximately 65 per cent of the increase in grants to the states is made up of tied grants, of special purpose payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the states are in the hapless position of finding that their ability to raise their own taxation revenue has been undermined by the massive increase in Commonwealth taxation, which stands at an increase of $13.9 billion, and they have received only an additional 9.8 per cent of that by way of grants, of which 65 per cent are tied. That is, with 65 per cent of those grants, that amount of money, the states are being told exactly what they are allowed to do. Thus, the Commonwealth is tightening its central control over the states by diminishing the states' ability to raise revenue and, at the same time, removing the flexibility that they require and desire in order to organise their own affairs whilst having regard to local conditions&mdash;and this is being done in the spirit of true federalism by increasing tied grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It stands that the states' ability to raise taxes is becoming more and more dysfunctional because of the fact that the Commonwealth is increasing taxes at such a rapid rate and only remitting a smaller percentage of that back to the states. What the Commonwealth is remitting back to the states is going back to them in increasing percentages as specific purpose payments or tied grants. It is interesting to note a comment by the Premier of Tasmania. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The justification for specific purpose payments is that the Commonwealth considers that, unless states are told where to spend their money, they will not have appropriate regard for national priorities. However, in reality, specific purpose payments themselves contribute little to this objective because specific purpose payments agreements rarely clearly articulate the objectives of the program and the desired outcomes for the payments. They have the effect of directing expenditure usually to specific groups or specific interests.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that SPPs, through the states, tend to cloud the issue; they are not achieving the outcomes for which they are intended. In this day and age of micro-economic reform and with the Commonwealth desperately trying to get more efficiency and a more efficient outcome from the taxpayers' dollars that it spends, there seems to be a greater focus on outputs through special purpose payments rather than on outcomes&mdash;that is, this money is being audited and ticked off as it is being spent, but it is not being audited as to the true outcomes and real benefits which are being received by the community from this funding that is being spent in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great question there as to whether the government is heading in the right direction in increasing the revenue to the states at a far more rapid rate through tied grants rather than untied grants&mdash;and I come back to my earlier point on road funding and the larger question of the activity of the Commonwealth in the federal structure of Australia. I know that in Australia we do not have constitutional recognition of local government. But part of that federal structure surely is local government, as well as state governments, as well as the Commonwealth. There should be a sharing of responsibilities. There should be a sharing of the taxes that are collected from the very dominant position that the Commonwealth holds. I agree that there are particular areas for specific purpose payments where outcomes are being achieved greatly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those areas that was recorded in a report of the Auditor-General from the Australian National Audit Office was, in 1992, the local capital works program. There the Auditor-General found that less than one per cent of that specific purpose payment to local government was absorbed in administrative costs. Yet, on the other hand, in another SPP in the home and community care program&mdash;which is one of those areas where the responsibilities completely cross over between states and the Commonwealth&mdash;it has been found that in excess of 16 per cent of the funding or the grant which has been made available from the Commonwealth in that particular specific purpose payment is being absorbed for administrative costs. They are the areas that the Commonwealth has to try to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to that point I made in the earlier part of my contribution this afternoon: it is all about the taxpayers' dollars being spent efficiently and effectively and not being controlled entirely by the Commonwealth for what sometimes can be argued as political means. There should be a clear delineation of responsibilities between the Commonwealth, the states and local government and there should be a fair and equitable distribution of the revenue raised through taxation by the Commonwealth between the Commonwealth, the states and local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, under the current government, there is not a fair and equitable distribution of the taxes raised in Australia. More and more we are seeing a greater emphasis, particularly with funding to the states, on tied grants through specific purpose payments from the Commonwealth. Sixty-five per cent of the funding to the states is coming from the Commonwealth. </PARA>

We are talking about the way in which the federal government allocates the country's taxes&mdash;that is, the money of hardworking Australians&mdash;to the states. As a Western Australian representative and as a Liberal committed to federalist democracy, I stand committed to restoring to the states the ability to make their own spending decisions and to be accountable to them. I know that this is a very central theme which our leader recently spoke on and supports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has never had the courage of its centralist convictions to go to the owners of our federal constitution, the people of Australia, and ask them to transfer powers from the states to the federal government. Instead, it slakes its budgetary problems and tightens the centralist screws by treating grants to the states as a form of discretionary spending. Clearly that is wrong, in my view. If it wants to take that course of action, it seems quite clear to me that it should put that proposal to the Australian people and let them make the decision as to whether they want to be totally controlled by a government centred here in Canberra. </PARA>

We all know that the former Prime Minister had a strong commitment to improving the federalist system and delivering to the states a much fairer system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only need to have a look at some of the facts. On an international comparison with other federations&mdash;dating from 1986, but still valid&mdash;the Australian states raise 40 per cent of their own revenue needs, while the Commonwealth raises 130 per cent. In Canada and Germany, the provinces and Lander raise 90 per cent of their revenue and the national government raises 100 per cent. In simple terms, both levels of government in these federations are substantially responsible for raising the money they spend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one of the weaknesses of our constitution that no satisfactory division of revenues has existed since 1910. This does not, however, absolve any federal government from the responsibility to pursue an equitable solution. A level of government responsible for 41 per cent of all public spending in Australia has access to only 24 per cent of the revenue. This is the stark truth behind the esoteric term `vertical fiscal imbalance'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has actively worsened this situation. Over the last decade payments to the states by the Commonwealth have fallen by 13 per cent in real per capita terms. The general purpose outlays of the Commonwealth, however, have risen by 17 per cent in real per capita terms over the same period. The states have been made to pay for Commonwealth aggrandisement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I remind the House, however, that when the states lose revenue it means far more than an embarrassment to state governments and it means far more than the problems they then have to try to solve. It means that the people of those states&mdash;the same people we represent&mdash;pay for the revenue shortfalls by loss of services and higher fees and charges that hit their pockets and the CPI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government has long forgotten that it is merely the trustee of income tax and excise revenues paid by Australians and that it is not giving to the states its own bounty. It is merely the trustee of this money. The states have responded to the challenge by increasing their own revenue sources from 39 per cent in 1982-83 to 49 per cent a decade later. There is, of course, a limit to the amount by which these revenue sources can increase further without damaging state economies and inflicting hardship on more Australians who see their five minutes of economic sunshine fading fast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth of tied grants under this government again has been a matter of deliberate policy. As a proportion of total payments to the states, they have risen from 44 per cent in the first year of this ALP government, 1983-84, to 54.8 per cent today. Tied grants mean that one of the two levels of elected constitutional government in Australia can spend revenue only in accordance with the wishes of the other. Tied grants mean that more public servants at the Commonwealth level are employed in the task of second-guessing and manipulating the actions of their colleagues at state level. In other words, it is maximum interference in the work of the elected governments of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1990 the previous Prime Minister agreed on a major review of service and fiscal reform in the federation. At a Special Premiers Conference in Brisbane, at a time when the ALP held government in every state except New South Wales, a communique agreed upon the need to reduce vertical fiscal imbalance, to develop a tax sharing proposal that would provide the states with a predictable revenue stream and to review the roles of both levels of government and the duplication of the bureaucracies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This initiative was deliberately undermined by the then prime ministerial aspirant Paul Keating, who publicly invoked the atavistic, destructive centralist instincts of the ALP to damage his predecessor. Again, these were decisions made for short-term political expediency&mdash;not the long-term welfare of the citizens of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1991 at the formation of the Council of Australian Governments, again dominated by state ALP governments, a proposal was put forward that the states become accountable for an identifiable component of personal income tax, set at 6c in the dollar for three years and collected by the ATO under a continuing single tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Revenue and budget neutrality would have been assured. After three years consultation, mechanisms would have been set in place for changes to tax rates and thresholds. Any responsible federal government would have at the very least sat down and discussed these proposals. Our imperial Prime Minister, however, totally rejected them out of hand. Once again, sometimes I think he thinks this is a game. Again the game was played for short-term political advantage&mdash;not for the long-term benefit of the people that occupy and live in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, not only Western Australians but all Australians can take heart from the commitment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) on 6 June that a coalition government will allocate a fixed percentage of tax revenue to the states and will wind back the proportion of disbursements taking the form of tied grants so that the states will be able to decide their own priorities and stand accountable for them by the people of those states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government of Western Australia established a constitutional committee with a wide ranging membership to examine the operation of our federal system. Its report was made public in January. The message that the committee received in its consultation was that the financial autonomy of the states must be increased. To quote Professor R.E. Ewin:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If each State raised its own income tax (along with other taxes) to pay for such responsibilities as education and hospitals, then it would no longer be under the financial control of the Federal Government and would have good reason to behave responsibly in expenditure. It would be more directly answerable to its electorate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the people who vote for the state government representatives&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">who would see exactly what they were paying for, rather than seeing what some far-off government in Canberra collected from all the people in Australia and then redistributed as it saw fit.</PARA>
<PARA>Without being prescriptive, the WA constitutional committee made a number of positive suggestions involving either the redistribution of tax powers to the states or giving them a share in Commonwealth revenue bases. One of the points that were made specifically in that committee report was creating space in the income tax base would retain the ATO as the common collection agency, comparable income tax assessment acts in the state and a single tax return identifying state and Commonwealth liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point the report made was, alternatively, the states could be given a guaranteed share of the sales tax base. The third point the constitutional committee recommended was that `a great deal can be achieved without any alteration to the constitution'. Negotiated agreements within the Commonwealth and the states could restore to the states a proper degree of financial autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not endorsing these or any other proposals for federal-state financial reform. What I do say, however, most strongly is that a responsible Commonwealth government would consider these, along with other constructive suggestions, aimed at nothing more or less than the principle that both levels of government should be responsible for raising the money they spend. It is about fiscal responsibility, commonsense and, ultimately, real democracy. None of these aspirations appear to be valued by this blinkered and centralist Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go back for a moment to the Commonwealth's own spending. It must be noted that the Commonwealth has raised its</PARA>
<PARA>own purpose outlays from $89.9 billion in 1993-94 to $88 billion in 1994-95. This is an increase of $6.1 billion, representing a nominal increase of seven per cent. If the 1993-94 figure is adjusted for inflation in 1994-95 of 4.5 per cent, the own purpose outlays of the Commonwealth increased by 2.5 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The past decade has witnessed a dramatic decline in the payments by the Commonwealth to the state and territory governments. The Commonwealth government's own purpose outlays as a proportion of total budget outlays have increased by 11 per cent, rising from 66.8 per cent in 1983-84 to 74.2 per cent in 1995-96. This is contrasted by a 22 per cent fall in the total payments to the states and territories as a proportion of Commonwealth budget outlays, falling from 33.1 per cent to an estimated 25.6 per cent for the same period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. Like so many of the decisions made by this government, the main criterion of its decision making is too often not taking into account the interests of the nation's citizens but rather to engage in political manoeuvres for short-term expediency. That does not augur well for good government in this country. The ultimate test of any policy should be whether or not it best serves the interests of the people of this nation. Clearly, in relation to the government's policy on state grants, this is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has become incredibly out of touch with the electorate. That has been evident by some of the Prime Minister's public statements of late&mdash;that this is as good as it ever gets, that this is the best it has been in 20 years and, to small business people, `If you can't make it in this climate, you'd better get out and go and get yourself a PAYE job,' in a marketplace that already has a vacancy of some 800,000 jobs. The government has shown itself to be completely out of touch. I suggest that it is so greedy and grasping for power that it endeavours to trivialise and marginalise the advocacy for a return to the federal system. This does not serve the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there is enormous cynicism out there in the electorate because people feel so dislocated and so removed from the process of government in this day and age. We can only increase that cynicism by developing a policy of centralist government, which is the theme of this ALP government&mdash;to centralise government here in Canberra and to remove the people even more from the process of government&mdash;all for the power and the greed that that can deliver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a strong advocate for strengthening and improving the federal system of government, as is our leader, in the interests of better management and management of people who are much closer to the problems than any centralist government can ever be. I think that the government ought to have taken heed of some of those discussions in Brisbane several years ago where the former Prime Minister himself advocated a much fairer and better organised system to address the difficulties that are being experienced by the state governments in their funding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Page for his question and inform the House that last week I released a very comprehensive report that indicates what has been achieved in the first year of Working Nation. Significant achievements have indeed been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the first year of Working Nation, 385,000 jobs have been created. That is more than 1,000 jobs a day, every day. The long-term unemployed numbers in the period have come down 20 per cent, compared to 11 per cent for total unemployment. The labour market programs have maintained and in some cases increased outcomes, despite the fact that clearly we are having to deal with more difficult clients, and we are getting many more long-term unemployed into traineeships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have indicated that it is my intention to finetune certain aspects of Working Nation to reflect what employers and businesses are saying that they want by way of changes. But, as impressive as the first year has been, we have got to go further, and that is why Working Nation was not a one-year commitment but a four-year commitment, and funded accordingly. That is why the emphasis in terms of the change to the training agenda and the commitment to working with regions and responding to their requirements will see, in the coming years, not just more jobs but better and more secure jobs, because what we are about is equipping the work force, industry and development in this country for more sustained economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition, of course, says that Working Nation has been a flop. Some flop! The fact is that Working Nation is working, has worked to date and will continue to work. But do not take just my word for that. Let us have a look at what some of the other commentators have had to say about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry put a press release out saying, `Working Nation is working', and the deputy chief executive officer of that organisation in his own press release `rejects opposition claims that Working Nation is a flop'. You have not done too well there, Dr Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission said of the first-year report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Working nation is working well and must be supported and applauded. It is a world leader in what Labor market programs and an active employment policy can achieve in getting long term unemployed people job ready and linking them to the job market.</PARA>
<PARA>I will read one final quote, which I think might be interesting to members on the other side of the House. When I was in Bendigo, amongst a number of other regions, last week, the Deputy Chief Commissioner of the Bendigo City Council&mdash;none other than Peter Ross Edwards, a former member of the National Party in Victoria&mdash;said, `From my own point of view, I believe this is one of the most imaginative and productive programs of its kind that I have seen for many years.' He is about ensuring that his council gets behind those initiatives. That is a message that not only has been coming through very strongly in the first year but is increasingly being committed to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government, we have a commitment to support the programs for the remaining three years. It is those on the other side of the House who have stated intentions to cut those programs. We will not continue to beat unemployment without the support of these initiatives.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. As the Leader of the Opposition, present here today, would be only too aware, yesterday saw the spectacle of 10,000 Western Australian battlers out in the streets demonstrating against Graham Keirath's latest efforts in industrial reform, his so-called second wave of reforms. Knowing Minister Keirath as I do, I am sure today he is parading around wearing this as some sort of badge of honour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More reasoned observers&mdash;I include among them, although I never thought I would say it, the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry&mdash;are now urging Mr Kierath to drop this proposed legislation. The most conservative group you can imagine is saying, `Graham, don't do it.' Even the chamber can see that this legislation is so extreme as to be a recipe for industrial mayhem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst other things, the legislation cuts off the pay of union officials during an industrial dispute. It allows employers to nominate their employees' union. That's a splendid piece of democracy, isn't it? It effectively deregisters any union which seeks to move from a state to a federal award&mdash;a wonderful piece of democracy over there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, the legislation is so oppressive that today it has been reported that the South African union movement&mdash;perhaps they were confusing Mr Kierath with some of their former political leaders&mdash;are threatening sanctions against Australia on the basis of this repressive legislation. I saw in the Foreign Affairs cable only yesterday that this Kierath legislation has actually generated a demonstration outside the embassy in Manila.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it did not have such grave implications it would be a heck of a laugh. But, of course, the reality is that the Leader of the Opposition has made it a very serious matter indeed because, as the Leader of the House indicated, he has adopted this Kierath model as the very template that he would follow. This was dealt with by Nigel Wilson who, I think in a very timely fashion, reminded his readers in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today that the Leader of the Opposition had described Western Australia's new IR laws as the model that would be followed by a federal coalition government. That is what he said&mdash;the very model. As Mr Wilson went on to report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there was a collective wince from business leaders at Howard's enthusiastic endorsement of Western Australia's leadership in IR reform . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is what happened but, of course, if ever the federal opposition did get themselves elected, it would be a collective wince from all of the battlers all the way round Australia that we would see because they would find the Western Australian approach, the approach that Graham Kierath is pursuing, imposed Australia-wide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say, it was in a rare moment of candour that the Leader of the Opposition actually promised this in such clear and unequivocal terms in his recent visit to Western Australia. Of course, in doing so, he absolutely exposed the softly, softly approach being taken by the member for Flinders.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen the reports. They come from comments made by the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, on the radio this morning. Since those comments reflect upon the government, they do require a bit of an answer, I think, in this place. In one part of his interview, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Canberra I think they've lost their way&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the public servants&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . they've lost they're creativity, they're fundamentally tired, and after the next election I don't think there's more than two senior public servants that should be retained.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Jeff had to say about it. I leave aside the fact that Jeff Kennett's government, like every other Liberal government around the states, has been actively recruiting senior public servants for the last five years. That is not on the basis that they are offered a better chance to be more creative in the Public Service in their states, but it is on the basis that they pay them a heck of a lot more money to work for them than they are paid when they work for the Commonwealth. That is the basis on which they are attracted. But these are the people that he describes as being tired and worn out. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think they should have a look at their own performance and ask themselves whether they have the will or the creativity to continue to serve in senior positions. I think most of them would accept that they're burnt out and that they don't provide leadership&mdash;either to the rank-and-file members&mdash;but I don't think they're contributing much to Government policy.</PARA>
<PARA>These senior public servants are, of course, responsible for the policy advice and the administrative function that have put in place a decade of reform of our economy and a decade of reform of our social safety net to make it one of the most admired by those in equivalent industrialised countries around the world who take an interest in that. They have put in place a decade of reform in our foreign policy which has seen a light year's jump in our capacity to conduct our affairs in this region. These burnt out cases have put in place absolutely everything that the Leader of the Opposition squibbed on for seven years during the period that he was in office. That leads us to reflect upon who might well be the burnt out case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interview he went on to say, `There's always been too many public servants.' He implied that at the Commonwealth level&mdash;and also at his own level, I might say&mdash;there are too many public servants via that process. As far as growth in the public sector and the Commonwealth sector is concerned, until the end of last year&mdash;there are more now&mdash;net figures showed that about 1 1/2 million new jobs were created in this country. Over that decade, the number of people employed in the Commonwealth sector had actually fallen by 60,000. I do not think you could sustain a case on the basis of that that there was over-employment in the Commonwealth sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been a product of sensible micro-economic reform, unlike his slash and burn in which he got rid of about 40,000 public servants in a couple of years. So substantial was his slash and burn that, when I was looking at the progress of one quarter's growth figures some time ago, the results of his sackings actually showed up in the figures. We owed a quarter of a percentile of the growth figures for that month to his sackings, because redundancy payments show up in growth figures as an outlay. He managed to contribute, with his sackings, a quarter of a per cent of the growth in that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went on to say in the interview, `Who are the two public servants I'd like to see retained?' but he did not name anybody. Who is the author of this scintillating brilliance? Who is the person who has chivvied the mind of Jeff Kennett, making him come out and make these extraordinary statements about the people whom he is actively recruiting to the Victorian Public Service? It is John Howard. The interview went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOURNO:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Have you discussed this in detail with John Howard?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">KENNET:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No, not in detail <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">but we've had discussions in the past. We've had discussions this morning</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA>We now know where he got those two people from. Apropos of previous questions: was Jeff Kennett lying, was he misleading or was he simply misinformed about the attitudes of the Leader of the Opposition? I suspect that he was neither lying nor misinformed about the attitudes of the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;he got them dead right. He said, `We've had discussions this morning' and, as a result of those discussions, if the Liberal Party were elected to office, they would put together a good Public Service `in the same way that we have done here in Victoria'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we see in all this? The Leader of the Opposition is like Frankenstein's monster. You shut all the doors. When you send him out, you put him in an iron maiden and carry him around the place. When you beat on the visor of the iron maiden, out comes a fluting voice: `All is well. I'm not what I once was. I'm not what I once was.' Then somebody&mdash;some damned fool somewhere&mdash;flips the clasp and out of the iron maiden comes Frankenstein's monster saying, `Now I want you to know exactly what we have in mind for you. Wait till you get a load of me.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose what that means is that we must review those comments that he gave to the honourable member for Canberra about the security and safety of public servants in Canberra and the fact that they are not there for wholesale masochists. They are not Jeff Kennett's 15 per cent of the Public Service. They will not show up in the quarter's growth figures, so rapid and massive was the decline. That is what he had to say to the honourable member for Canberra. Did he mis-speak, or did he engage in a bit of creative philosophy when he sat down? Perish the thought that he was actually lying when he spoke to the honourable member for Canberra and said, `Hand that around to all the public servants in the Canberra area.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact of the matter is that he gets out of that iron maiden in Western Australia&mdash;which is one of the few places that will let him out&mdash;having told everybody over here that what he now has in mind for industrial relations is something much softer and gentler than what he had in mind before. He goes over there and speaks to a government which has now earned notoriety in the Asian community of all places&mdash;that is, in the region around us&mdash;for its suppression of labour rights and civil liberties. He says, `The Western Australian government's industrial laws are our template for the industrial laws that we will institute nationally'&mdash;that is the expression he used to the business community in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have Jeff Kennett unclasping the iron maiden over the phone in Victoria or wherever it was with John Howard. We now owe Jeff Kennett at least this: we now have a thorough understanding of what is intended for the Public Service. The private conversations of John Howard are very different from his public protestations on this matter. We can be grateful to him for that, even while we disagree with the totally churlish and irrelevant comments he has made about those people he so actively recruits.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to inform the House that pensioners and other allowees and recipients of social security assistance will be receiving quite significant increases from 20 September as part of the regular indexation of these payments. As of 20 September, the single rate of pension will be rising by $9.80 per fortnight, the rate paid to each member of a married couple will be going up by $8.20 per fortnight and the pension cut-out points will also be indexed. That, as a consequence, raises the limits under which people will be able to receive the pensioner concessions. Also, we will see indexation of rent assistance, which will also provide additional benefits to families, and of the telephone allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combined effect of all these increases is a very substantial budgetary commitment by the government. In aggregate, when you take into account the flow-on effects to allowances, which are also quite significant, we are looking at a budgetary impact of about $900 million in a full year as a result of these changes. That also, I should say, flows through to the new parenting allowance, which will increase by $8.20, and the new maternity allowance, which is set at six weeks of parenting allowance. That will be going up to $840.60.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What all this illustrates is that, in a very tight and difficult budgetary environment, this government is prepared to maintain a commitment to comprehensive indexation of virtually all features of the social security system. This, of course, is in marked contrast to the performance of the opposition, which was prepared to see the progressive erosion of a range of these payments during its tenure of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the first act of the now Leader of the Opposition when he took over as Treasurer in 1978 was to reduce the frequency of indexation of pensions from twice yearly to annually, which had the effect of depriving pensioners of one full week of pension over a six-month period. That was part of an overall pattern under which the value of these sorts of payments slipped in real terms under the coalition, whereas under us it has increased consistently in real terms.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have this chance to reiterate to the House the federal government's absolute support for the third $8 a week safety net rise for Australian workers. Could I make it clear that for us in the Labor Party this is sacred ground. It is a fundamental part of Accord Mark VII, which provided for the phasing in not of one, not of two, but of three $8 a week safety net increases for workers who have been unable to strike an enterprise bargain. These people are often the lowest paid in the whole of the working community in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These increases were negotiated under the Accord process and had the strong support of the Accord partners, and had that support when they were taken before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission last year. The commission granted the three increases&mdash;the $8, the $8 and the $8&mdash;and said at the time that it would be subject to a review of the third of these increases which would be carried out this month. That review is currently under way. Before the commission, both the government and the ACTU are again strongly supporting the third $8.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that a number of employer groups have also supported the cause. The MTIA, the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Manufactures have accepted the safety net increase. Having said that, it must be noted that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, true to its form, is opposing the increase for ideological reasons. But I think what is much more revealing is that the four conservative states in Australia&mdash;Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia; Western Australia, the model, the template for the Leader of the Opposition in his IR approach&mdash;have all joined together and gone to the commission to argue against this very modest and very fair increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having failed individually to achieve any successful reforms in their own systems, this gang of four are now trying to deprive ordinary Australian workers of an $8 increase under the federal IR system. Not content with having slashed the safety net for state award workers in their respective states, they are now intent on vandalising the federal system, to which several hundred thousand of their workers have escaped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This says so much about the coalition approach to industrial relations. Coalition members are so opposed to the concept of a safety net that they try, as they are doing on this occasion, to pick the pockets of Australian workers of a wage rise that was agreed to in principle by the commission last year. Does anyone realistically think that the federal coalition, if it were ever in government, would be any different&mdash;the federal coalition which has already announced Western Australia as its model, as its template? Of course, the answer to that is a resounding no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Flinders, even when he was going softly, softly after his meeting with the ACTU last week, could not help himself.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question. Yes, I am aware of a commitment of some $76 million over the next four years for literacy education in Victoria's schools. I must say that the steps taken are very much in line with the Commonwealth's efforts&mdash;very much in line. In fact, the literacy intervention program in the Victorian package was developed with Commonwealth funding from its own early literacy program. So too were the literacy tutoring program and a CD-ROM for teachers which the Victorian government included in its own package. Even the conferences on the early years of schooling which the Victorians have foreshadowed are a Commonwealth idea. The first of these conferences is due to be held in Adelaide in December.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is delighted that a Liberal state government has seen the merits of what the Commonwealth has been trying to achieve in the field of literacy. Unfortunately, the Victorian government has not recognised all the difficulties of teaching literacy. One vital ingredient is teachers; another one is schools. Since 1992, 300 Victorian schools have been closed and 8,000 Victorian teachers have been retrenched. Between its budgets of 1992-93 and 1993-94 the Victorian government cut $240 million from its education budget. This $19 million a year focus on literacy is certainly welcome, but it would need to run for precisely 12.6 years to make up what was lost in that one budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Teaching literacy requires new graduates in the teaching profession, but they will be attracted only by a properly resourced education system and proper pay.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), in answer to a question today, said that after my discussions with the ACTU I made it clear that we would not support a safety net jurisdiction for the Industrial Relations Commission. It is an absolute untruth for him to say that. I have made it clear in black and white in writing that it is coalition policy to support the jurisdiction of the commission to receive safety net applications. Not only have I made it very clear; the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has made it very clear. For the minister to say otherwise in contravention of the facts is fraudulent. He is deliberately misleading the House and he ought to withdraw it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In proposing this matter of public importance today we have the opportunity to analyse the reasons that have been placed on the record as to why the government believes it is entitled to pay the legal fees of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in her attempt to close down the royal commission, known as the Marks royal commission, in Western Australia. The first point to make is that this is not a question of whether or not the government is paying the fees of Dr Lawrence to appear before the royal commission. Rather, it is a question of the Commonwealth paying the fees to close down the commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that in 1990 guidelines were tabled by none other than then Premier Lawrence herself, stating when people are entitled to have their legal fees paid when they are to appear before a royal commission. Those guidelines cover only government ministers at the time, including staffers and servants of the government. The coverage applies only to those legal costs incurred at the royal commission. This means that Premier Richard Court, not being a member of government at the relevant time, has to pay his own legal expenses. I think it is important to note that&mdash;Richard Court is paying his own legal expenses, whereas Carmen Lawrence is having the taxpayers pay $10,000 a day for her to attempt to close down the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 18 and 20 May of this year, Carmen Lawrence applied to the Western Australian Solicitor-General to have her fees paid by the Western Australian government. That matter is still being negotiated and it has been indicated to Carmen Lawrence that she meets the criteria of the guidelines for when she appears before the commission. In fact, there are 12 people who have already had applications dealt with and have been granted finance for their appearances before the commission. There are three still under consideration of whom Carmen Lawrence is one. But the guidelines are to deal with appearance before the commission when it is quite proper for that matter to be considered, not to close it down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most interesting to look more closely at the relationship between Mr Halden, who is the man who introduced the petition which is the subject of the royal commission; Mr Easton, the public servant who indeed was the petitioner; and Carmen Lawrence herself, in her previous roles as minister and as Premier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note at the present time that it is actually Mr Halden who is taking the legal action because Dr Lawrence has no legal standing. It is rumoured about that Mr Halden's legal fees are being done pro bono; that is, Mr Halden's fees are being done for free&mdash;his legal work is said to be for free. But it is Dr Lawrence who is using the same solicitors, that is, the firm to which Stephen Loosley is a consultant in New South Wales, and the lawyers are from New South Wales, not Western Australia. The income to the lawyers is, in fact, coming from the taxpayer via Dr Lawrence as a siphon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The person who is appearing in court with all these actions to try to close down the commission is Mr Halden, not Dr Lawrence, but the Commonwealth is funding Dr Lawrence and is using her as a siphon to finance the legal proceedings. Once again, Mr Halden has become the fall guy for Dr Lawrence. Dr Lawrence wanted the petition brought into the parliament on a particular day because that was the day the police were to announce that Dr Lawrence had had $5,000 of taxpayers' money in her bank account for 2 1/2 years&mdash;from the same source as Brian Burke took his $17,000, for which he was prosecuted and went to gaol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well you should ask the question&mdash;and many people have: how was it that the DPP could decide to prosecute Brian Burke for taking $17,000 out of his imprest account and decide not to prosecute Dr Lawrence for taking $5,000 out of her imprest account? Where can the accountability for that decision be made, except perhaps in this royal commission? It is important to note that Carmen Lawrence stood before the public and said that this is all political, it is all because she is a woman, it is all because the sky fell in, or for whatever reason. Yet she enabled, and connived at, bringing in that petition to take the heat off her for having $5,000 of taxpayers' money in her bank account, which&mdash;guess what&mdash;she forgot about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important that we take a look at the quality of Dr Lawrence's memory. It is not the first time that she has had amnesia or a bad memory. In fact, you could say that she has very similar recollection problems to those of Alan Bond. I think there are some very good parallels to be called upon between Alan Bond and Carmen Lawrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that Carmen Lawrence also misled the Western Australian parliament on a previous occasion when she was Premier when, on 20 October 1992, she said that she had never heard of the company Western Women. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is absolutely repudiated.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in answer to an interjection that she knew about them&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have never met Robyn Greenberg, or the senior people associated with companies. I did not even know the name of the company until its collapse.</PARA>
<PARA>The funny thing was that she had no fewer than three pieces of correspondence signed by her&mdash;one of them written to one of the directors as `Dear Sandra'; one of them saying, `I cannot intervene any more because it is the ASC that has taken over this responsibility&mdash;no longer the Western Australian commission.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am dealing with is Western Women, where Robyn Greenberg siphoned the savings of women and squandered them on shopping sprees. But they went to Robyn Greenberg only because the Premier, Carmen Lawrence, gave a letter recommending her as a wise source of investment&mdash;not an ordinary `it is okay to go to her', but promoting her. And Dr Lawrence forgot all about the fact that she had ever met them. But then she said later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had no recollection of the letter&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the one she signed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">when I made the relevant remark to this House. At the time of making the remark I believed it to be true and I had no reason to doubt its truth.</PARA>
<PARA>Gosh! Does that all sound familiar?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, my error was an error of memory and I apologise for it.</PARA>
<PARA>Do you think we will get a similar apology on this latest one?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, I have learned from it the crucial importance of checking for factual accuracy of all the details of every statement that I make to this House.</PARA>
<PARA>My goodness! We have had Carmen Lawrence appearing before, and let us refresh our memory with what she had to say. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After discussions with the petitioner and on the advice of the Clerk of the Legislative Council, honourable John Halden adopted the appropriate processes and tabled the petition at a time of his choosing. I was informed that he was going to do it and I learned of the detail of the petition and its general thrust upon its tabling. That is the way it is and that is the way I have explained it. That is the position.</PARA>
<PARA>That, let me remind you, is the statement she refuses to make to this House. That is the testimony she refuses to stand by. That is the testimony which Kim Beazley refuses to back up. That is the testimony that this government is buying time to prevent being dealt with by the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Keith Wilson contradicted her advice. Pam Beggs, Graham Edwards, Zoltan Kovacs, Bob Willoughby, Marcelle Anderson, Ian Taylor, Judyth Watson and, of course, the now Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Jenkins)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! The honourable member for Mackellar might be very careful in referring to matters that are before the royal commission. The Speaker, during yesterday's question time, set some guidelines for discussion of the matters that surround this case. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Mrs BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for that guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I made sure that I am meeting not only the Speaker's ruling yesterday but also that of former Speakers which are on the record. We heard much from Mr Beazley today about the fact that, really, it does not matter if Carmen Lawrence lied. It does not matter at all; it does not go to whether her integrity is impugned. He said that the royal commission really does not matter much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), Mr Beazley said that in the matter of paying Dr Lawrence's fees the question does not go to whether she is fit to hold office in the federal parliament. On the other hand, he said that if she lies it does not matter. So we already have a major problem there on the record from the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that this royal commission was called to find truth and justice, which seem to be two issues that are lost on the ministers of this government in their callous treatment of the material. I remind you that the terms of reference say that the question to be investigated is whether the presentation of the petition involved conduct that was improper or inappropriate use of executive power or public office, or was motivated by improper or inappropriate considerations, and for that purpose it then details other things. In looking at the question of justice&mdash;which is what this royal commission is really about&mdash;let me read to you the words of Barbara Campbell, the mother of Penny Easton who died as a result of that petition. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I hear Carmen Lawrence and the Labor Party expound their virtues I am outraged. If their record was so brilliant, why was it necessary for my daughter Penny's divorce case to be aired in such an untrue and disgraceful manner under Parliamentary Privilege in order to play down the information about the Premiers retention for 2 years a travel payment of some $5,000 that she was not entitled to?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When unemployed student Jenny Lee Trewin retained money she was not entitled to while she was trying to improve her employment prospects and become a nurse&mdash;she was charged and found guilty, sent to jail and required to repay the money. She would have been entitled to keep that money if she had laid on the beach and done nothing . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was obvious to anyone and to my daughter Penny that the Easton Petition tabled by Halden was a Political ploy and designed to do maximum damage to Richard Court and members of my family . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had written to Premier Lawrence about my case and had also appeared before an all party Parliamentary Committee inquiring into the Official Corruption Commission&mdash;so I believe that Carmen Lawrence was well aware of the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My daughter Penny in her last letter before taking her life said&mdash;"No one committed perjury in my family. Everyone told the truth. I have been set up so well that I have no way out but this. I cannot live with the hurt that is being done to my family. I know it's all political". She also says "I cannot live in this corrupt place anymore" . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is when I read her last letter that I feel compelled to act to try and change the Government and those in it that have abused the power and trust placed in them on this and many other occasions . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I accept John Halden's public apology for something that should never have happened, though it will not give me back a wonderful and talented daughter who was driven to suicide by his and others actions in Parliament on that fateful day. Our family continues to suffer the effects and I plan to do all in my power to ensure this does not happen again.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are trying to ensure, that this does not happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A single individual was sacrificed for the political ambition of the then Premier of Western Australia, who is now the Minister for Human Services and Health. This is the same woman who says that she trumpets women's rights. This is the same woman who sent other women to a corrupt woman and lost their savings but then could not remember anything about it. This is the same woman who is intelligent and able but cannot remember what she said on that fateful day. This is the woman who says that all her colleagues lie; only she tells the truth. This is the woman who will not stand in this parliament and defend her own statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, when we look at the funding, we look at a complicitous government which is corrupt in its action of funding an attempt to cover up the truth. But I believe that the Australian people simply will not wear it. At the end of the day, they know when someone is telling the truth. They know when someone has used and abused their power and their privilege for personal aggrandisement and personal power. That is not the Australian system, and it is not the one that will be allowed to prevail. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seldom heard in this parliament or in any other parliament such a disgraceful and unworthy speech as that made by the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), leading this debate for the opposition. The member for Mackellar came into this parliament with a letter written by the grieving mother of Mrs Easton and trumpeted that this was caused by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and was to be solved by this commission. For the member for Mackellar to do that is as big a lie as her suggestion that the Leader of the House and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) said, `It doesn't matter if she lied.' When the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is checked tomorrow that will be shown to be false.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing that has already been pointed out&mdash;it is known to the honourable member for Mackellar&mdash;is that this commission will do nothing to look at the factors that caused the tragic death of Mrs Easton. That is the reality. If it were the intention of the Premier of Western Australia to deal with that issue, he could have done it very simply. He could have referred it to a coroner's inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funds have been wasted in this contemptible and malicious exercise initiated by the Premier of Western Australia. Members of the opposition seem to have overlooked one thing in regard to the saving of funds; that is, there has already been an inquiry. There was an ongoing inquiry into this issue by a committee of privileges in the Western Australian Legislative Council. That does not seem to have been referred to or thought about by any honourable members opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did that committee of privileges find? It looked at the very issue of parliamentary privilege. It even communicated with the Clerk of the House of Commons in England to get as much evidence as it could on the whole nature of petitions and the parliamentary process. What was the conclusion of the committee? It endorsed the statement of President Baker, the Chairman of the Senate in 1903, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the universal rule in all Parliaments that I have ever heard of that any member is bound to present a petition, no matter what the contents of it may be, so long as it conforms to the standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly in the Legislative Council this has been thought to be the case. Thus there is no enforceable right but members regard themselves as bound. A member who took delivery of a petition for presentation and then wilfully failed to present it would be in breach of privilege.</PARA>
<PARA>Once Mr Halden was presented with these facts, who drew up the petition? It was not Carmen Lawrence; it was not Mr Halden. Mr Halden took it to the Clerk of the Legislative Council, a senior officer of the parliament. The Clerk of the Legislative Council, who did his best to see that it was in the proper form, prepared the petition, and Mr Halden had the responsibility of tabling it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the finding of the privileges committee that was set up to look at all the details of this matter. They went further. They looked at the motive. They looked at the facts in the Easton petition, which they found were not accurate, and they made decisions. It was not until two years later that the question of Carmen Lawrence's involvement in this process was raised.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing is clear: once a petition is in the hands of a member, he is bound to present it to the parliament, whether he agrees with it or not. That has generally been the rule in all parliaments, including this parliament. Another aspect of this which seems to have been overlooked by members of the opposition is that no person or body&mdash;not a Premier, a Prime Minister or a cabinet&mdash;can tell a member who has a petition and has the duty to lodge it that that course of action should not be proceeded with. If it were to be suggested, it would be a clear breach of the prerogatives and privileges of the individual member. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of a sudden what is important is that the government of Western Australia, and Mr Court in particular, has determined to have another commission of inquiry.

Firstly, he and I&mdash;and every other member of parliament, state or federal&mdash;take an oath to uphold the law. The law in relation to matters canvassed in the Family Court is that they will remain secret. Nobody would bring a petition to the parliament that demanded they broke the law. That is the end of that argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the simple fact that the parliamentary inquiry was conducted in the Legislative Council into the activities of a member of the Legislative Council is a matter of record. That person was John Halden. What is more, as has been published and stated by members of the then Premier's staff, they lived in absolute fear that at some time they would be called before that committee. The reason they were not called was that at that point the parliament of Western Australia still believed that premiers told the truth. They did not bother to investigate the involvement of the then Premier, Carmen Lawrence, and her staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These were the matters and that is why things have gone a step further. Why have they gone a step further? Why are we having this debate today about moneys being expended in the plaintiff activities of the minister for health? These matters are before a royal commission because since that inquiry a member of Carmen Lawrence's cabinet, the Reverend Keith Wilson, could no longer live with his conscience and maintain his silence. He went out and explained that there was an involvement by the then Premier, that she had a knowledge. To his certain knowledge, he had heard her tell with great glee the story of how she was going to blackguard the reputation of an innocent woman, using evidence given in the Family Court, for political gain, to get at one Richard Court. It was necessary to get up in the parliament under privilege and say that there had been a police investigation of Richard Court on the complaint of Brian Easton when, in fact, he had complained that Richard Court had given privileged information to his ex-wife and that was the source of her information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> at the time obliged with two narrow coloured pictures&mdash;one of the then Premier and one of Richard Court, the then Leader of the Opposition&mdash;with the headline `Premier and Leader of the Opposition to be investigated by the police'. That was not even true. They had both been investigated. Court had been totally exonerated and they had decided not to charge her for having $5,000 of the people's money in a bank account for two years, for two tax returns. I make something of that tax return. Our tax agents do not do other than ask us to explain that sort of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This MPI is about government expenditure to defend or avoid a personal recollection resulting from a dispute between two Labor government ministers; namely, the Reverend Keith Wilson and the present federal minister for health, Carmen Lawrence. Reverend Wilson has made only one statement on the issue and has been consistent thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all experience memory lapse but, scientifically, we only totally forget when subject to some massive physical or psychological trauma.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the legal costs, which are the subject of this debate, result from the conflicting recollections of a number of people, all of whom were associated with one political party. Furthermore, it would appear that, other than on matters of minute detail, every one of those people has the same recollection, with the exception of one person: the minister for health. Most have now presented their recollections under oath and been subject to cross-examination by one of the most expensive QCs in Australia. The other one has obtained government funding to attempt to prevent such an inquiry into her recollections and to pay a leading QC to cross-examine her own political colleagues in an unsuccessful attempt to shake their recollection of events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one recalls the vicious attack members of this federal Labor government collectively launched against Carmen Lawrence's cabinet colleague the Reverend Keith Wilson when his conscience could no longer condone his silence regarding Penny Easton and when, amongst other things, federal Labor ministers questioned his sanity publicly and made snide references to one of his children, I guess it is reasonable to argue that a Labor Premier might not consider a personal attack on a Liberal opponent or the blackguarding of the reputation of an innocent woman as worthy of remembering. They probably do not; they do it to their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when the result of a cabinet decision in which you participated is the loss of billions of dollars of taxpayers' money and that happens afterwards, you remember. Yet we have had this minister for health stand up in the state parliament, whenever asked about a mere $400 million that went off buying an empty block of land and a partly finished feasibility study, and say that she could not recall. It has become a joke. They produced a tie in Western Australia with `I cannot recall' on it in Latin and it sold in large numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the result of blackguarding an innocent woman's reputation is that that woman suicides, you do not forget. It does not matter how minuscule the issue was at the time. When the result of that is a woman's suicide within four days, you remember with stark clarity. In that situation, no normal person would be other than contrite. No normal person would be other than devastated. No normal person would fail to admit their involvement and apologise profusely. No normal person would seek to sequester the hard-earned funds of the Australian taxpayer to hide their shame. </PARA>

There is no reason to scratch your head and ask: what is the evidence of that? Have a look around in the parliament at question time. The member for Moore (Mr Filing), Independent, has been driven out of the Western Australian Liberal Party.

They do not have a National Party in Western Australia, so all the rednecks, all the League of Righters, all the fascists and all the Noel Crichton-Brownshirts gather in the Liberal Party, and it has split them asunder.

When built, a significant part of the extension will lie in my electorate of Tangney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say `when built' advisedly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The road funding crisis in Western Australia extends over the entire state and has deepened to the point where there is a 16-year $1.2 billion backlog in the state road building and maintenance program. There has been a massive decline in Commonwealth road funding to WA. The total federal road allocations to WA, including untied funds for roads, have fallen by 40 per cent from the 1992-93 level. In real terms, federal road funding to WA has dropped by $90 million a year since 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the federal government abandoned the urban arterial road program, of which the Roe Highway extension was a part, the state of Western Australia was left with a $200 million liability to complete the metropolitan projects in that program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is just as bad in rural areas of Western Australia. Excluding the national highways, the rural road network needs an additional $400 million over and above current resources for country road projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The black spot road safety program produced a huge benefit in pure economic terms. For every $1 spent on safety improvements, more than $10 was saved as a direct benefit. Most importantly, though, it saved lives on our roads. There were 34,000 accidents in Western Australia in 1993. These accidents produced 200 deaths, 2,600 seriously injured people and another 8,000 people who required medical attention. The cost to the community was over $1 billion, or $600 for every man, woman and child in the state.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Road freight is expanding at 10 per cent per annum in WA because the great majority of goods are transported by road. Road train operations greatly reduce transport costs and the benefits flow to the community directly in cheaper goods. For environmental and safety reasons, these operations need to be confined to arterial routes. However, there are numerous links that do not exist and which cannot be provided under existing funding. The Roe Highway is one of these. The result there is that commuter feeder roads in the area of the planned extension are clogged with semitrailers and other heavy transport.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that rural Western Australian roads need an extra $400 million, without even considering the national highway system. The national highway system is the responsibility of the Commonwealth. Twenty-five per cent of the national highway system is located within Western Australia, yet the state receives only seven per cent of the funding. There are large sections of single-lane sealed road in Western Australia, and bridges need to be constructed or upgraded. Western Australia receives $58 million per annum for its national highways. The state needs at least double that amount&mdash;$116 million. If the Commonwealth is responsible for the national highways, then it should properly fund them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If my state is to address the issues that are caused by an inadequate road system&mdash;that is, damage to the environment, inadequate road safety for Western Australians, increased cost of transport, and stifled development in the mining and pastoral industries&mdash;then a balanced, realistic funding program has to be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 12 months to August 1994, the federal fuel excise rose 7c a litre to 33c a litre. In doing this, the Commonwealth has increased its revenue collections by $1.5 billion. Western Australians are paying an additional $160 million a year, but not one cent has been returned by the Commonwealth government to roads. Western Australia contributes more than 10 per cent, or $780 million, of the total fuel excise raised by the Commonwealth&mdash;a massive $7.3 billion annually. Of the $780 million that they give to the Commonwealth in this way, Western Australians receive just $150 million from the Commonwealth to try to meet all roadworks. In contrast, all of the fuel levy collected by the Western Australian state government is being progressively returned to roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian government is doing more than playing its part. While the Commonwealth has been cutting funding to Western Australia, the state has increased funding roads from its own resources. Over the last two years, the state has allocated an extra $60 million to roads from revenue collected from motor vehicle licence fees and the state fuel levy. In addition, funds from within the state main roads department from sources such as the sale of property, permit fees, rents and plant reserves have increased the state road funding by a further $38 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state road system needs an injection of $100 million a year over the next decade to rebuild the deteriorating network, complete the planned Roe Highway extension and metropolitan ring-road extensions, and establish new roads to support the development of the state. Funding for a $40 million road safety program is needed to address the more urgent projects. The federal government must double the national highway system funding Western Australia receives. The Commonwealth should also return a greater share of the federal fuel excise to Western Australia for roads in the state. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to thank the various members who have contributed to the debate on this important piece of legislation, the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1995, which goes to the Commonwealth funding arrangements for the states and follows on from the Premiers Conference and the Council of Australian Governments meeting in April. It is worth briefly going over a couple of matters that have been raised. We have had some criticism that this was part of some sort of centralist agenda that was being run. The amendments have been debated throughout the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this matter was discussed at the conference back in April&mdash;unlike what has been a tried and true tradition of a major haggling between the premiers, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis)&mdash;there was very strong agreement about the approach that was outlined and is now being implemented through these provisions in the real terms guarantee that was being provided and the three-year rolling program extension that is part of the provisions contained in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the heads of government were concerned, that followed a historic agreement about developing the competition agenda and the competition policy initiatives that have flowed from that time. The competition bill has now been enacted. The benefits that will flow from the micro-economic reform process are real and tangible, particularly for the states, and very much in the nation's interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the whole point of that process. There was a recognition that the Commonwealth needed to respond to concerns the states were raising. But we argued all the way through that the net economic benefits of that micro-economic reform competition policy regime were going to be very tangible for states, for state efficiency and for state enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then went from that. The government had to haggle and indeed provide financial incentives to the states to cooperate. But we reached a historic agreement as far as the competition arrangements were concerned and there was very strong consensus at that meeting about the processes outlined in terms of these general purpose grants contained in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time there have been approaches made to a number of states to ask whether they have concerns about the provisions that are contained in the measures that were adopted in April and whether there are particular sticky points that the states want to raise. The states have made it very clear that they think the sort of agreement that was reached and the certainty provided in the arrangements outlined in April was a very satisfactory outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, is the position. That is precisely the position. This package that is contained here is giving states security. It is certainly providing the real terms guarantee. It is providing increased revenue to the states and it is ensuring that they maintain their programs and have opportunities to expand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, states naturally take on their own priorities, some of which we question from time to time. For all that was made about what Premier Kennett might have said, Premier Kennett has been able to find resources for the grand prix and all sorts of things that some people would say are not necessarily the key priorities. But the states are still able to find the resources for those things, often at the expense, sadly, of some other key services that the Commonwealth regards as important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) in her contribution earlier today referred to areas such as HACC funding. She suggested that the Commonwealth's approach to its role in that area was not as productive and that there was a duplication. I want to say to the member for Mackellar that, in conjunction with one of her colleagues on the other side, we have pursued an issue that relates to HACC arrangements in the north-western part of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only because of Commonwealth intervention that we were able to get a successful outcome for a particular disability service that was vital to the residents of north-western Sydney. Where we could not get sufficient agreement from the previous state government, even though they did have responsibilities under the HACC agreement, we got a successful outcome because the Commonwealth had leverage in the area and was able to see a way through to deliver an outcome that provided the ongoing support for a vital service provided under the home and community care program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think there is value in us sensibly looking across the board in those ways. But we have, as we have demonstrated through the key changes made in April with the heads of government agreement, seen the benefits that will flow from looking at greater efficiencies in the various business enterprises of state and Commonwealth governments. Whether it be water, energy or others, we have to look carefully at those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to road funding. This has been an interesting discussion. Everyone is, on the one hand, saying that there should be more general purpose grants and, on the other hand, decrying that there is not greater road funding definition within the allocations that are made. The decision to untie those arrangements came very much at the request of the states. The decision to untie the road grants, to free them up as part of the overall pool that the states got, came at the request of the states and because the Commonwealth agreed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the measures relating to the urban roads grants to local government contained in the bill, we see that there is a continuing agreement that they will be separately identified, but that there is freedom as to how they are distributed through those processes. It is interesting to note that, despite all the posturing that occurs about road funding, the previous state government in New South Wales actually did not spend allocations that were provided on roads. They tried to divert them off to other areas of transport and did not meet the obligations of providing better roads, which we all see as a priority area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the key thing is that the states have autonomy; they have the scope to ensure they deliver on the services. They have to make sure they deliver them well. If a state government sets a priority of a grand prix rather than health services, as has happened in Victoria, then that is a priority they should be accountable for. There is nothing in the Commonwealth-state grants general purpose provisions that does other than say that they have to be accountable for the arrangements they enter into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But where we do make specific purpose payments in relation to aged care, child care or other areas, I think they are again a case of a nation setting appropriate priorities that it should have. They should apply across the board. The fact that a particular state government does not want to deliver those services or wants to have a slash and burn approach to their public sector is something the Commonwealth is not going to acquiesce in. We are going to take steps to ensure comprehensive social policy infrastructure across the nation. Indeed, that is as it should be. The constitutional arrangements require us to exactly be providing that sort of direction and leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other provisions contained in the amendment from the opposition related to matters of student unionism and university arrangements. A couple of members referred to the fact that this was a measure that had been slipped into the bill and had not been talked about. The first thing I should say is that it is not in the bill. It does not relate to the bill whatsoever. So it has neither been slipped in nor even addressed. That in fact relates to a matter that was debated in a previous piece of legislation, the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1994, which has since been passed by the parliament. So there is nothing in the amendments that are contained before the House that relate in any way to the issue that is the subject of part 2 of the amendment that has been moved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key thing to say about that issue, given that it has been raised, is that the onus is on the states to deal with and repeal the arrangements they have which impede the appropriate provision of funding for autonomous higher education institutions in this way. In any event, if that were done that would overcome the concern that members have as far as the Commonwealth role is concerned. I repeat to the House that it is not part of the bill. So, in relation to the amendment that implies that something is a threat in the bill, I make it abundantly clear that there is nothing in this bill that goes to that issue whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this is a very positive piece of cooperative federalism, as members have called for in the course of the debate. That is something that has been achieved and which the premiers' historic agreement reached at the Council of Australian Governments in April highlights. The fact that the new competition regime has come into place, and that this general purpose funding not only is securing funding for 1995-96 but also is ensuring the three-year rolling arrangements of funding are continued up to 1997-98, provides strong stability across the financial services of all the states. The arrangements for local government that have also been passed achieved the same objectives. So I commend the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>This bill amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act 1990, the Veterans' Entitlements (Rewrite) Transition Act 1991, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1992, the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1994 and the Military Compensation Act 1994. The bill will also repeal two obsolete war service homes acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains a number of minor policy and technical changes to veterans' affairs legislation. The amendments improve readability, correct imperfections in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 rewrite and correct typographical errors. The bill rectifies anomalies in certain assessments of service pension and income support supplement. These include the calculation of child related payments and of rent assistance for certain blind pensioners and also for certain war widows and war widowers who receive a `frozen rate' of service pension. Some of the changes to the provisions for service pensions have been made to bring consistency with the Social Security Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will allow people participating in local exchange trading systems to do so without their non-cash credits being taken as income in the assessment of their service pension or income support supplement. Carers of service pensioners who accompany the veteran overseas will be able to continue to receive their carer service pension for up to three months of their temporary absence from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also extends eligibility for a remote area allowance to service pensioners and income support supplement recipients who are residents of Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island. A remote area allowance is to help compensate residents for the higher than normal costs associated with living in a remote area of Australia. Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island are acknowledged as remote areas for taxation purposes, and the extension of eligibility for a remote area allowance under the Veterans' Entitlements Act to residents of those islands will remove an anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The period for which Somalia is an operational area for the purposes of the Veterans' Entitlements Act is to be closed as from 30 November 1994. Somalia has been an operational area under the Veterans' Entitlements Act since 20 October 1992. All Australian personnel serving in Somalia were withdrawn by 30 November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two acts to be repealed are the War Service Homes Agreement Act 1932 and the  War Service Homes (South Australia) Agreement Act 1934. These acts approved agreements between the Commonwealth of Australia and the commissioners of the then State Savings Bank of Victoria, and between the Commonwealth of Australia and the state of South Australia, to arrange the transfer back to the `War Service Homes Commissioner' of the bank's or the state's interest in certain war service homes. If there was any continuing Commonwealth interest in the properties covered by those agreements, it was transferred to the Westpac Banking Corporation when it took over the defence service homes mortgage portfolio in 1988. The War Service Homes Agreement Act 1932 and the War Service Homes (South Australia) Agreement Act 1934 serve no further purpose, and their repeal is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a bill without financial impact that will put into place a number of minor changes. An outcome of the changes is improvement in the administration of benefits for veterans and their dependants. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) has informed the House, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment and Repeal Bill contains a very large number of minor amendments to the very large amount of legislation that is involved in administering veterans' affairs. Members of the coalition, me in particular, have consulted the various veterans organisations and other interested parties in relation to this legislation. We are prepared to support all of the proposals before the House today. It is very difficult to find specific issues that are worthy of mention in themselves&mdash;simply because they make only small changes, although some of the more positive ones relating to remote area arrangements et cetera are naturally welcomed as they do add to the entitlement of our veteran community. The coalition's view is that at all times we should endeavour to do that within the bounds of fiscal responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I wish to say that we support the various amendments that this legislation proposes. Mr Deputy Speaker, I crave your indulgence to make while I am here a couple of very positive remarks&mdash;it is amazing how the atmosphere can change in this place&mdash;about recent events under the Australia Remembers banner. I would like to take the opportunity briefly in the House to register my and the coalition's thanks to all the persons who were involved in the recent Australia Remembers activities, related of course to 15 August, known generally as VP Day. Might I add, because the minister is here, that congratulations go to him for his involvement, most particularly his department's involvement. Might I also note the substantial effort of the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who ran an excellent parade and other activities on the Gold Coast. I am well aware of her personal involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great highlights of this year's parliament is that we have seen members from both sides working with a common purpose; that is, to remember the efforts of so many brave people so many years ago. It is well worth putting on the record the arrangements made both by the department and by individual members around Australia for the penultimate event, which was 15 August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Celebrations in my state were on both Sunday 13 and Tuesday 15 August. I think it was wise for some states to use that other date so as not to clash with the principal event in Brisbane on the 15th which I was lucky to attend. Most states and state capitals had events on the 15th which resulted in parades around Australia, some numbering many thousands. I think the figure for those marching in Brisbane was in the tens of thousands, but the minister might correct me. It was probably 30,000 or 40,000. Is that a reasonable estimate?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were about 15,000 marching. I thought there might have been more. They certainly took a long time to pass by where I was sitting. The marchers included large numbers of veterans and young people from all around Australia who had qualified by participating in an essay competition which required them to interview some veterans and to write essays relative to the veterans' recollections of their wartime experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, where we also implemented a similar arrangement at the electorate level, this has been a very worthwhile exercise inasmuch as young people have discovered matters of family history that nobody had ever bothered to write down. For those of my age&mdash;we were of roughly age 10 when the war ended&mdash;one of the most notable factors is the very limited extent to which any of the veterans came back and told us what the war had been like. They just came back, went out and got a job and went back to work doing all sorts of things. Unfortunately, because of many deaths a lot of that very interesting information at a family level has been lost. But, to quote some young people from my electorate, they said that when they went out to interview grandad he talked and he talked and he talked. I thought that was lovely. I thought that was a really nice response from the kids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have gone around the schools in my electorate making presentations to those associated with Australia Remembers, I have found a very increased awareness. When I started off I discovered that most kids did not know that a digger was an Australian soldier. When I asked them what it was, thinking that was a way to keep their interest, they said it was someone who digs holes in the ground. Of course, that is the truth, but the nickname component had been lost on them. I hope we are encouraging them to remember. Australia can be proud of what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a note here to thank the national media, whom I think gave excellent coverage of the 13th to the 15th. Some words went back and forth between me and the ABC about covering Sydney, for obvious reasons, but there is no doubt that the coverage it gave to the celebrations of the 15th were excellent. Someone told me the other day that it was replayed on a Sunday afternoon. I hope the ABC will put an edited version into the ABC shops. I am sure a large number of us would be interested in owning a copy as a historic record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be given the opportunity this afternoon to support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment and Repeal Bill and to talk briefly on the clauses in this bill. It is basically a tidying up bill containing a number of amendments which will make important changes for individual veterans but which do not include major new policy items.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains a number of minor amendments to programs administered under the veterans' affairs portfolio. Some of these are significant in themselves and I would like to spend a little time talking about them. One of the first and most important amendments in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 relates to exchanged trading systems. This brings the veterans' entitlements into line with the Department of Social Security entitlements and reflects an amendment that I think was brought into the Social Security Act last year. I could be corrected; it might have been earlier this year. We coined the description of the exchange trading system amendment as the Deahm amendment, named after Maggie Deahm, the honourable member for Macquarie, who was the person who first suggested this initiative to the government. I am pleased that veterans will also be entitled to take part in this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment enables people to be involved in trading systems where people provide goods or services, usually in exchange for points, which then enables them to use those points to acquire other goods or services from other members of the scheme. Such schemes are also referred to as counter trade or barter transactions. The definition of `income' contained in the Veterans' Entitlements Act is sufficiently wide, which would include consideration received from a trading system for the purposes of the income test. In this amendment we are therefore going to exclude that and exempt from the definition of `income' amounts credited to a person's account for the purposes of an approved exchange trading system. This is a very positive measure because it enables veterans to participate in what is a very worthwhile community based activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be an approved exchange trading system, the Repatriation Commission must be satisfied that it is a community based system, its primary purpose is to help people maintain their labour skills and contact with the labour market and that the scheme is not run for profit. Therefore, private companies operating such schemes will not be eligible for exemption under this act, but community groups that are involved who are seeking not to make a profit but to involve people in maintaining their labour skills and contact with others will be involved. I applaud the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) for including this benefit in the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next clause relates to maintenance income. Special maintenance income includes maintenance income provided in relation to expenses arising directly from a physical, intellectual or psychiatric disability or a learning disability of a maintained child where the disability is likely to be permanent or to last for an extended period. Item 19 of schedule 1 of the act currently excludes disability expenses from the definition of maintenance income. The effect of this amendment is to exclude income arising from a dependent child's disability or learning difficulty that is likely to be permanent or to last for an extended period from the calculation of the rate of pension. It is a positive measure for those people who are affected by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other amendments that tidy up conditions and make minor changes to the Veterans' Entitlements Act. They will benefit certain individuals who are in receipt of these benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also comment on the contribution that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) made in his remarks about the Australia Remembers program, and endorse everything that he had to say. I was pleased to join with him in Brisbane on VP Day and watch the parade that occurred in Brisbane. I was proud to be a citizen of Brisbane on that day and to be a citizen of Australia and to see us pay such important recognition to the veteran community and all those who served in some form or other in the Second World War. That has been the strength of the Australia Remembers program. In a lot of our activities we highlight the contribution that service personnel have made, but we tend to forget a lot of other people. Australia Remembers corrected that. In our celebrations and commemorations we remembered everybody who played a part in the war effort in keeping our community going and in supporting our service personnel in their important work both at home and abroad. That was the reason why the Australia Remembers program attracted such monumental support around the country. My congratulations also go to the minister for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to comment on the lack of any real recorded history about a lot of Australian's contributions to the war. That is an issue that the member for O'Connor raised, which is a very valid one. My grandfather served in the Second World War. He was a prisoner of Changi and he worked on the Burma railway. He was one of the few who managed to survive and come back to his home and his family, but in a massively debilitated state which he never recovered from. He had permanent ill-health ever since that time and up until the time of his death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People like that who were prisoners of war did not tell the stories because they did not want to impart to the families exactly what they had suffered. They did not want people to understand because it hurt them too much and they did not want to burden their families with the daily grind and the daily torture and poor conditions that a lot of people experienced who were prisoners of war and for a lot of people who were not prisoners of war, but who struggled considerably under difficult circumstances in their particular theatres of war or campaigns. They did not want their families to share that burden. A lot of them held it in themselves. Part of the reason why so many of them did not survive and were not able to be with us 50 years on is that they contained that burden within themselves and were not able to share it and express some of the pain and anguish that they had suffered during those war years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other major benefits of Australia Remembers is that finally we are recording a lot of those stories. We have had an opportunity through the great work of the Australia Remembers program to allow some of those veterans and some of those other people to get their stories told. One story that took more than 40 years to be told and only came about because of the diligent effort of an ex-service person who found out about it was a story I got involved with in my electorate. That was the story about the two operations of Australian navy personnel who invaded Singapore in the darkness of night and sank a number of Japanese ships. I am referring to Operation Rimau and Operation Jaywick. One of my constituents, who died on the second operation, was involved with both. We finally had the opportunity as a local community to honour his memory and his contribution through the Australia Remembers program. His story had never been told because he was forced to keep it a secret. Even when he came back from the first operation and had been awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, he was not allowed to tell his family why he had been awarded it. It was an official secret and he was not able to tell anybody what he had done and why he had been accorded an important medal such as the DSM for his service. </PARA>

The local community where he grew up and where he lived his short life before he died just before the age of 21 had never known about it. One of the great pleasures I had through the Australia Remembers program was for us to dedicate a plaque in Andrew Huston's honour at the primary school which he attended for seven years, the Yeronga state school, in my electorate. It was a really wonderful opportunity for the children of today to hear how a young man who had very similar activities, habits, sports, dreams and hopes for his own life as these kids today have, was able to rise to such incredible personal heights of bravery in his participation in Operation Jaywick and Operation Rimau. </PARA>

He has allowed the people of the southern suburbs of Brisbane to put up a commemorative plaque to remember all of the service personnel and others from the southern suburbs of Brisbane who participated in the Second World War. He has allowed the students of Mount Gravatt State School to remember one of their own by having a plaque to remember one of their former pupils who died in the Second World War.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have the opportunity once again to speak in the parliament on veterans' affairs. Indeed, I support, and the opposition supports, the legislation that is before us, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment and Repeal Bill. It deals with a number of important, although I suppose relatively minor, matters. Nevertheless, because it affects veterans, to me and to the parliament, of course, it is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased to see the government addressing the issue of the portability of the carer service pension. There has been a serious anomaly there in the past. I am pleased to see that the legislation is to be amended to provide that a person in receipt of a carer service pension will not lose eligibility for that pension while temporarily out of Australia for a maximum period of three months while accompanying the person cared for. I particularly note that amendment because it is one that I had encountered and there was obviously a serious problem that needed to be fixed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of concerns to veterans at any point in time. I know that legislation will be before the parliament shortly to address a number of other issues. I wish to raise one or two issues in the context of this debate. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) may be aware&mdash;although it would have been his predecessor who dealt with the matter&mdash;that I asked a question in the parliament on 15 December 1993, which is a couple of years ago, about the deaths of Vietnam veterans. I asked how many Vietnam veterans had died since returning to Australia. The answer I got at the time from Mr Howe, who was acting on behalf of a minister in the Senate, was that there had been 2,900 deaths since 1973 and 176 of those had been classified as deaths from suicide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vietnam veterans have never accepted those figures and believe they are considerably higher. There is concern about the Vietnam veterans mortality study which is being undertaken but which has not yet been finalised. The suspicion&mdash;and I say it is a suspicion because that is all it is&mdash;is that as many as 10,000 Vietnam veterans have died from various causes, including a significantly higher number than the government admits to as a result of suicide since returning from Vietnam. So that is an ongoing concern to Vietnam veterans&mdash;the status of that mortality study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge and appreciate that the government has in its most recent budget announced additional assistance for Vietnam veterans, particularly with their health problems. I acknowledge that quite freely. The Vietnam veterans appreciate that. But I think this mortality study, which is ongoing, as I understand it, needs to be completed so that we can put to bed the fears that many veterans have that many more have died than is publicly acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern that has been brought to my attention in recent days is the shortage of nursing home beds. This is a matter which I have taken up with the appropriate minister, not the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It is a real concern in my electorate. It is a concern in many electorates. But it is now having a serious impact on World War II veterans, many of whom are in that age group and many of whom are not able to get suitable nursing home beds. In the context of this bill, I point out to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs&mdash;to his credit I note that he is in the House for the debate&mdash;that that is a problem which perhaps he ought to concern himself with. It is not directly within his area of responsibility but it is a problem for World War II veterans in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that has come to my attention which I do not know whether the minister is aware of is the concern about the apparent agenda of the Department of Veterans' Affairs to drive private domiciliary nursing providers out of New South Wales. It has been brought to my attention that this is a problem. There are 7,000 veterans in New South Wales alone who are serviced by domiciliary nurses. I am very concerned about this. Certainly, the 3,500 nurses who are employed as domiciliary nurses in New South Wales are very concerned about it, too. To their credit, I say that I share their concerns, because I believe their concerns are motivated by a concern for the patients that they look after. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening here is something that unfortunately is happening more and more&mdash;that is, the Department of Veterans' Affairs is in effect downloading its responsibilities for veterans to state governments. We saw an ongoing indication of this with the veterans' hospitals. Greenslopes, of course, is the one that has concerned me most. At least initially, there was an attempt to hand it over to the Queensland state government. In the end they did not want it, so it has now become a private hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that the service which veterans are getting there is not up to scratch, because the information I have is that they are still getting excellent treatment from Greenslopes hospital in its privatised form. But the trend here always concerns me when there is an attempt to in some sense pass on the care of veterans to something other than the authority that is set up to take care of veterans. Veterans will fight, and I will fight in this place, to maintain that special status that veterans have and, indeed, for the maintenance of a separate department to be concerned for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of this debate, I put on the record my concerns about what is actually happening in New South Wales at the moment. I would like ultimately to have assurances that the 7,000 veterans in New South Wales who are being cared for by domiciliary nurses are not going to be affected adversely by these particular changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also&mdash;since you have given some indulgence to the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson)&mdash;say a few words about the VJ Day celebrations. Let me say broadly that I think Australia Remembers as a year has been very successful. I congratulate the minister, who is in the parliament at the moment. He is probably getting a big head because everyone is congratulating him. I have thanked him publicly in my own electorate on a number of occasions. People who know me know that I would not be one to damn anyone with faint praise. In fact, I suspect that, if I err, I err on the other side in not giving credit at times where it is due. So I am not doing that lightly. I think it has been a great year, a great event, and the minister has made an enormous personal contribution to that. Not only was Australia Remembers a great year, but I think Australia will remember Australia Remembers. In effect, it will become a part of our history as well. I have enjoyed every aspect of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own father served in the Second World War in the 6th Division of the 2nd AIF. He went overseas in January 1940 and was away, in the first instance, for almost three years. He suffered from his war service and died of war related illnesses subsequently. My mother has been a war widow for some time. She has been taken very good care of by Legacy. That is an organisation which does not get nearly as much recognition as it deserves. In the case of my mother, who is now an elderly war widow, Legacy is still available to take care of her when she needs its help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that connection, in the marches that I have taken my place in and in the commemorations I have been to, I have been very proud to wear my father's war medals on the right side of my chest. I think there will be an increasing tendency for people&mdash;I have noticed an increasing tendency for descendants of veterans&mdash;to wear their descendants' medals. I hope that that practice will grow, because there will be a time not too far down the track when our marches are going to be attended by the descendants of veterans wearing the war medals and decorations of their parents, grandparents or even great grandparents. That is a process I commend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a wonderful round of celebrations on the Gold Coast. I have been very fortunate to have had an excellent committee that has worked absolutely diligently at putting together a program of events, and I pay tribute to its members today. We had an excellent church service&mdash;I suppose we could call it a church parade or a church commemoration&mdash;attended by students from most of the local schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a march through Surfers Paradise on VP/VJ Day, on 15 August. The Gold Coast Turf Club put on a magnificent day last Saturday with an eight-race program. Each of the races was named after a particularly significant engagement in the war. The program had the Australia Remembers logo on the front and each of the races was named after a battle that was commemorated. There was the Milne Bay Handicap, and one was named after Kokoda. The program had a description of what actually happened and why those particular events were in the race program. I congratulate the chairman of the Gold Coast Turf Club, Keith McLean, for the way that he got behind us and made that a great day for the many veterans who turned up&mdash;free of charge, I might add. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On VP Day, the Currumbin RSL had an excellent commemoration. I commend the president of the sub-branch there, George Kemp, and the president of the club, Ron Workman, for the amount of effort they put into VP/VJ Day at Currumbin RSL. It was a wonderful commemoration, which I was privileged to speak at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay particular tribute to the young people who took part in that commemoration at Currumbin RSL, as young people had at Surfers Paradise in the bigger commemoration. I pay tribute to Brooke Mills of Palm Beach-Currumbin High School, Rebecca Hudson of St Augustines, Todd Binnie and Nicole Deane of Currumbin State School and Abby Sergeant of Elenora High School who all made wonderful speeches. In fact, the speeches made by the young people were really quite remarkable. I was absolutely moved not only by what they said&mdash;they had certainly researched what they said in detail&mdash;but by the way they presented them, in a very personal way and in a way which I think was a wonderful tribute to those to whom they were directed. Certainly I would like to include in my congratulations the Currumbin RSL commemoration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 September on the Gold Coast at the Allambe Garden of Memories, a particular part of the cemetery will be dedicated to the graves of veterans, and the people who own the Allambe Garden cemetery have donated that land. They are in the process&mdash;I was talking to them today&mdash;of putting that together. They have built a wall. The wall where the ashes are placed has a certain name, but I cannot recall what it is. The area is being turfed, and it is going to be a beautiful area. It was nearing completion today. On 1 September many veterans from all over the Gold Coast and all the schools will be represented, and I am very pleased that Minister Sciacca has accepted our invitation to be there to officiate on that day. I am complimented by the fact that he has accepted my invitation to be there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other event that I attended that I think is worthy of mention&mdash;there have been many other events&mdash;was the national reunion of the N-Class Destroyers Association. I had the pleasure of representing the minister at that event, because obviously he could not be everywhere in the week leading up to 15 August. That also was a wonderful event. There were about 300 ex-sailors present. I think I might have been about the only ex-Army person there, but they accepted me nevertheless. They had a fantastic time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do commend their organisation because their secretary did a marvellous job of putting that particular program together. They had even produced a video program for the night which was based on Second World War footage of the five N-class destroyers which served Australia so well in just about every theatre of war in which Australia was involved during the Second World War. So I put my congratulations to the organisers of that particular event on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say just a couple more things. I mentioned my VP Day committee. I initially chaired the committee, but I felt that because it was obviously going to be a huge task it was best that I handed that chairmanship over to a veteran, and I did. I must pay tribute to Lieutenant Colonel (Retired) Don Keith. Don put an enormous effort into this&mdash;I do not say this lightly&mdash;up to the point where in the week before the lead-up to VP Day he had a minor heart attack and was, unfortunately, not able to take part in anything that he had organised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been in constant contact with his wife in recent days, and he is recovering. But I did not expect&mdash;and I sometimes think that I am partly to blame&mdash;that he would take this job on with such enthusiasm. He worked day and night. He was in my office every day organising and writing letters, and we had everyone in my electorate knowing what was going on. To Don Keith, I would like to say thank you, and I hope that you will be returned to good health very soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank Ben Schuster, the president of Burleigh Heads RSL, and Eric Dobinson, the president of Robina RSL. I also thank the other members of the committee, Mr Joe Brain, Mr Glen Mylne, Mr Rick Wells, Mr Keith Whelan and Audrey Wicks, the Secretary of the Coral Sea Battle Commemorative Association. And to the many other veterans on the Gold Coast in my McPherson electorate who have helped, I want to say here today a very big thank you, because it has been a wonderful effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been humbled by my involvement with these marvellous people who have worked so hard. They have done it because they believed in it and they believed it was worth the effort to remember those who had given so much during those dark years&mdash;not only our ex-service men and ex-service women who went in 1939-1945 to serve, as we have been careful and absolutely correct to recognise, but those who stayed at home and who made such a wonderful contribution. They were mainly women, working in factories or working in their homes, doing what might be termed menial tasks by today's standards, I suppose. Society has changed. Nevertheless, the women staying at home knitted balaclavas and socks for the men who were fighting. Those sorts of activities have been remembered and recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that many of those people will be getting certificates of appreciation. We have widely publicised that in my electorate. We have ordered 5,000 certificates. I do not think that we have had quite that many applications, but we are getting up there. I will be holding some public events at which to award those certificates to people who are very deserving of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, one by-product of this year that is worthy of mention is that it has become evident that the cause to change the flag has been set back at least 50 years by Australia Remembers. I am not sure whether that was on the minister's agenda when this program started, although I did raise it in the parliament early on when I said I was disappointed that the flag was not on the logo. I accept that for one reason or another it was not on the logo. But whilst it has not been there it has been everywhere else throughout the Australia Remembers celebration with the result that the Australian flag will remain as it is for at least another 50 years. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill raises a number of issues, and I will be talking about four of them. As we all know, the purpose of the bill is to correct some of the anomalies between social security legislation and the Veterans' Entitlements Act and to bring them into line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing I would like to talk about are the changes to what are known as local exchange trading schemes, LETS. Talking about this is a particular privilege for me because this was an issue I raised with the social security minister back in 1993, shortly after I was elected. It was really quite a thrill for me to speak on this particular issue on the amendment to the social security bill because, as I said, I was instrumental in bringing that about. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LV5">Ms DEAHM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is known as the Deahm amendment. In fact, I had a letter from the people associated with LETS in Canada shortly after the legislation went through, asking me for a copy of the legislation and my speech. I had another letter from them today saying, `Thank you very much for sending me a copy of the Deahm amendment.' I feel quite embarrassed about that. They are now telling me that it is bigger in the UK than it is here, so we will have to catch up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem arose when the Department of Social Security asked people involved in this scheme whether they had done any work under the scheme, and their so-called earnings&mdash;in my electorate they are called ecos&mdash;were counted as income. These people were most concerned because it was an exchange program and what they were earning they could not actually pay rent or buy food with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I brought this to the notice of the social security minister at that time and he consulted fairly widely on this with his department and welfare groups and decided that he would amend the legislation with certain conditions. It was a great privilege for me to see that and to now see it being applied to the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This will mean that non-cash credits received by a participant in a local exchange trading system will be exempt under the definition of income. That was one issue I was glad to see applied to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue deals with blind veterans. Since the changes have been made to the Social Security Act concerning family payments and payments to dependent children, there is now a disparity between conditions applying to blind veterans and blind social security pensioners. This amendment corrects this anomaly to ensure that the service pensioners are not disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment means that the income and assets test will not apply to child-related payments and that failure to pursue a maintenance claim will not result in a loss of entitlements. Veterans will have greater certainty and security. They will receive family payments without having to go through the income and asset verification or maintenance claims verification. That is very important because a number of veterans find themselves with that particular disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue I want to raise is to do with carers' pensions. It is quite pertinent because the member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) and I have just come from a meeting of the caucus aged care task force, which I chaired, and our guest today was the executive director of the Carers Association of Australia. She was talking about the problems of carers and their particular needs. So this amendment has a particular relevance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment reflects the government's commitment to recognising and supporting the role of carers, particularly for frail veterans and other disabled members of our community. This amendment ensures that carers receiving carers' service pensions in respect of a severely handicapped veteran may accompany that veteran on a temporary visit outside the country of up to three months while continuing to receive the carers' pension over that time. Portability of the pension is extremely important. In this year of Australia Remembers, when there have been pilgrimages and reunions of different units within and outside the country, this will be a great advantage to those carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth issue I wanted to raise concerns the cessation date for Somalia as an operational area. From October 1992 service in Somalia for members of the ADF who were deployed in that area was declared operational service for the purpose of benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The Department of Defence has now advised that as from 30 November 1994 all Australian personnel who were serving in that area were withdrawn. The proposal is to amend schedule 2 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act to include a cessation date for Somalia as an operational area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is obviously a procedural matter, but in talking about it I would like to raise the issue of personnel from the RAAF base Richmond. As most people will know, because I talk about it frequently, that base is in my electorate. I sought the advice of officers at the base and they told me that personnel from Richmond flew resupply missions on Hercules aircraft for the full duration of that deployment. It was a major commitment of personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, there was an air movement deployment&mdash;the loading and unloading of relief supplies&mdash;and a lot of the personnel involved there came from Richmond, including a number of service women. It was fortunate that there were no injuries among the air force personnel who served in Somalia. Most of those personnel are still serving in the RAAF. RAAF Richmond has a strong reputation for excellence in the air drop of supplies to difficult and distressed areas around the world, in both peacekeeping and war zones, and I would like to pay tribute to those serving members at RAAF Richmond who were involved in the Somalia operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to pay tribute to all those involved in the Australia Remembers events throughout the year. Because of the demography of my electorate, there were two Australia Remembers committees&mdash;one in the Blue Mountains and one in the Hawkesbury area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of the children had done a project&mdash;either a poster or a book. They had also contributed to the larger posters for the assembly. It was really quite touching to see some of the very detailed work that these children had done. One piece of work that springs to mind is `grandma's contribution'. One of the children sat down and asked her grandma about her experience in the war. She then wrote down what her grandmother had to say. There were a lot of photographs and so on. The children were really keen and had done their research. As the previous speaker and the minister said&mdash;I agree with them wholeheartedly&mdash;the involvement of children in the Australia Remembers celebrations has been extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my friends at a function on Sunday night was a bit sceptical about Australia Remembers. He said, `What are we doing? Are we glorifying war? Are we going over all this stuff again and making people feel guilty if they weren't actually involved in the war?' I explained to him that one of the most important things we could do, apart from recognising and thanking those people for their contributions during the war, was to ensure that young people knew what happened and why it happened in order that it does not happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of talk about whether or not the apology of Japan is enough. One of the big problems is that a whole generation of young Japanese people have grown up not knowing what their country did or what their country's involvement was during the war. In that sort of atmosphere, there is the potential for those things to happen again. So I think it was very important that children were involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My committees also ran competitions within schools. They organised for a group of ex-service people to visit the schools and talk to the children. In the Hawkesbury area they ran a competition and in the Blue Mountains they visited the schools. I would like to pay tribute to Tony Atwood, who was the chair of the Blue Mountains committee and who organised the school visits. I told him at the outset that, as a war child, I would like to be involved in the visits and talk about the home front experience. However, because of my busy schedule I managed to get to only one school, but I must say that I found it quite a moving experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I told the children that these events took place before television, there was a great shriek from them. They could not imagine anything worse than life without television. I talked about sitting around the radio with my English mother, who had not been in Australia for that long, and singing all those wartime songs, which were mostly from World War I. I talked about what it was like. They also grimaced when I told them that my mother made my knickers and those of my sister out of old sheets and how scratchy they were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it served a purpose to let the children know that even those who did not go to war were still at a disadvantage. Of course, because I grew up at that time I thought the state of war was what life was like. Every time you wanted something you were told, `Don't you know there's a war on?' So I think the involvement of the schools was pretty important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, we carried out a lot of other events that were similar to those carried out in other areas. The main event in the Hawkesbury was a special race day. It has quite a keen horse population and they like their race meetings. The main event in the Blue Mountains, which took place last Saturday, was a VP Day parade. It was principally organised by the President of the Katoomba RSL. I am sure the other members of the committee would not mind my singling out Mr Pat Brook, who worked almost single-handedly on the VP Day parade for about a year. After begging and pleading with various people, in the end he got quite a lot of sponsorship. Half of the money provided to the committee was allocated to that particular event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The march and the service were very moving. It was also good that on that occasion members of parliament and local dignitaries did not play a direct part in that service. It was only ex-service people who were directly involved in the service. Afterwards, there was a big lunch for all the World War II diggers and their spouses. So those sorts of things have been extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having mentioned the chair of the Blue Mountains committee, I would also like to mention Miss Alannah Sledge, who was the chair of the Hawkesbury committee. This young woman is a public relations officer of the Hawkesbury Council. The council allowed her the time to carry out those duties, and I think that was excellent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our last event is tree planting along the fence of the RAAF base at Richmond. A tree will be planted for every ship, squadron and battalion in which people from the Hawkesbury area served. We will also be unveiling a plaque in honour of those people. As the previous speaker said, we will also be handing out certificates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to everyone who has been involved, particularly the minister. My local constituents found him to be a very amenable person. He was very popular and he is invited back whenever he wants to return. Certainly, he has all the PR skills for that. We were all saying, `What are you going to do next year?' He said, `Well, my wife will see me.' I would like to congratulate the minister because I think he did a great job in putting the program together and seeing it through. I know just about everybody has wanted the minister to visit their electorate. He flew from my electorate straight to Townsville, I think it was. So he has certainly been extremely mobile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found that the program brought back a lot of memories, particularly of my father, who died in 1961 at the age of 58 as a TPI. He had been in the navy all his working life&mdash;from a teenager onwards. He had served all over the world on various ships. I did not really get to know him&mdash;even up to the time he died&mdash;because he was away so much. By that time, the alienation that grows between a parent who is away a lot and a child growing up without a father makes it very difficult. So the casualties of war are still there, and sometimes I feel very much that I am one of those casualties. I would just like to put on record my appreciation of the efforts of those people all over Australia and particularly in my electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been a wide ranging debate, but I could not let the occasion go by without making some reference to the Australia Remembers program and specifically the program on the Gold Coast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) made reference earlier in this debate to the Gold Coast program. We decided early in the piece that we would need to have a parade and ceremony on the Gold Coast for a number of reasons. We were very conscious of the fact that the official Australian parade and ceremony was just up the road, so to speak; it was in Brisbane. We knew that quite a number of Gold Coast veterans would want to participate in that parade and ceremony, as they did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we have a large number of elderly people on the Gold Coast who participated in the war. We felt that, as the veteran community is so important on the Gold Coast, there would be people who would not be able to go to Brisbane but who would want to pay tribute to those who participated in the war, by watching the parade or participating in the parade. So the McPherson and Moncrieff Australia Remembers committees agreed to have a combined committee for the purpose of Victory in the Pacific Day on the Gold Coast. I therefore have two lots of thanks to give. I wish to thank the combined committee, which included people from Moncrieff and McPherson, and I also wish to thank my own committee, which was responsible for a program of Moncrieff events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned that we felt there was a need for a Gold Coast parade and ceremony because of the age of those people who feel very close to this event. But there was another dimension, and that is the very large number of tourists who visit the Gold Coast at any time. Whilst that was not something we thought of in advance, as we came closer to the day of the event, we became aware of comments by people who were visiting the Gold Coast regarding Victory in the Pacific Day. We knew that we had a responsibility to let people who might be visiting or having their holidays on the Gold Coast at that time know that we did have events and that they could join in. We felt that it would have been a great pity if afterwards they had said, `If only we'd known, we would have been there.' So our efforts were also geared that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, we had a very modest approach to the event because we had no particular resources. The only available resource was the money that might have been available from the original $20,000 grant. Of course, grants had already been given from that original grant&mdash;certainly in relation to Moncrieff&mdash;well before the Victory in the Pacific celebrations. Different ex-service organisations applied for grants which came out of that $20,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moncrieff also had a major commemoration of Victory in Europe. We thought that was important for a number of reasons, not least because Australians&mdash;notably our air force&mdash;served in the European theatre of war, but also because a large number of European migrants live on the Gold Coast. In any event, when we did organise a free, open-air and quite spectacular concert, we had outstanding community support. A large number of people from a non-ethnic Australian background&mdash;if I can use that term&mdash;appreciated it and participated in it by attending the concert.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the climax for Australia without a doubt was the Victory in the Pacific celebrations. With all the thankyous and nice things that have been said, there is something that I nevertheless must put on the record. There was a person who seemed to be dedicated to stopping this event on the Gold Coast. This might seem almost incomprehensible&mdash;it was to me and I know it was to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), whom I engaged in this matter early in the piece. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we started organising celebrations for 15 August, we discovered that there was some difficulty within a state government department. Whilst our initial dealings with that department had been very cordial, by the end of June I became a little concerned at the mixed signals we seemed to be getting from telephone conversations with the local office of the state Department of Transport&mdash;Queensland Transport as they call themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hasten to add that the person with whom we had been having the contact&mdash;a gentleman named Gordon Forrester, who is himself a Vietnam veteran&mdash;was at all times courteous and seemed to us to be anxious to be supportive and helpful. It very quickly became my conviction that there was at least one other person in on the act and that Mr Forrester was having to do as he was told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event, we were denied permission to hold our parade through Surfers Paradise. Fortunately, I guess, this was about 10 days before the state election was held. I wrote a quite explicit letter on the subject to the Hon. Ken Hayward, the Minister for Transport as he was then, and I provided a number of people with copies of that correspondence. To Mr Hayward's credit, action from his office was very quick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My letter was faxed to his office and would have arrived there on a Friday evening. I suspect that they were working weekends, because the election was one week out at that stage. First thing on Monday, I received a telephone call from his office to say that our request for a parade through Surfers Paradise had been approved. We had to write again reseeking approval, but we were told that it would be approved if we re-applied. We were pleased with that outcome and went ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the end of the story. Having been led to believe that the parade would be approved, I received a quite extraordinary letter from the Department of Transport after the election which included amongst other things an indemnity form. It was a request for me to personally indemnify the state Department of Transport should any mishap be associated with the parade. The letter said that costs associated with the parade were estimated to be in the range of $3,000 to $3,500 and I was to be personally held liable for those costs. I was a little startled by this, as you might understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had consulted with a number of other people who organise parades on the Gold Coast. We do have road closures on the Gold Coast from time to time&mdash;for example, we have traffic disruptions for a few months at a time for Indy. The local festival called Tropicarnival and an event called Anzac Day also close the Gold Coast Highway in several places. Everybody I contacted who had ever had occasion to request that a section of the Gold Coast Highway be closed for a period of time was quite mystified. They had never been asked for indemnity. I hate to think that they might all be asked for indemnity after my making this speech&mdash;I hope that is not the outcome. None of them had ever been asked to sign any indemnity form, and none of them had ever had any of these costs put on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I immediately asked for a full and detailed breakdown of this $3,500 cost which I was personally going to be liable for. I was told that there was not actually a breakdown, but that this figure was a guess because Queensland Transport was not quite sure at that stage how many police and how many signs would be required. This is the state Department of Transport talking about the costs of police for the parade and the costs of transport signs which had to be erected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The police donated their time, as they always do for Anzac Day, so there was no charge for that. The Gold Coast City Council, I am very grateful to say, provided all the necessary signage because they had the resources to. They did that without even being asked; they made that offer. When the state Department of Transport put those conditions on me personally, I saw it as an act of personal spite, frankly. The person responsible for that letter being written was not only talking through his hat but he had no right to say those things. He had no right to put that condition on approval for the parade because those costs were nothing to do with the state Department of Transport. In the event, all of those services were provided at no cost to the committee, for which I personally was enormously grateful and so was the organising committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We depended very heavily on community support which, by and large, was forthcoming. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we were conscious of the fact that we had to reach tourists. I wrote to all the accommodation houses on the Gold Coast plus all of the bank and building society branches within my electorate on the grounds that tourists, even if they do not stay at a motel, sooner or later need to go to a bank. I asked the accommodation houses and bank and building society branches to erect posters and make fliers available which, by and large, they did. I was a bit disappointed that the ANZ Bank alone never responded, in any way, to any of my correspondence, but all other banks and building societies did, as did quite a large number of hotels and motels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must put on the record several heartfelt thankyous. As I said, we had no particular financial resources. We were operating essentially out of my photocopier machine, the folding and enveloping machines and postage allowances of the members for McPherson and Moncrieff. That was about all the resources we had, plus goodwill. The Gold Coast City Council, as I said, made available very substantial expertise and resources to us&mdash;notably their engineer who was a very great practical help to us in many ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also a gentleman called Allan Russell, whom I must mention, put a great deal of physical effort himself into organising all sorts of things that, frankly, would have been beyond me&mdash;not the least of which were several hundred seats for the veterans when they got to the park where we had our ceremony. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure behind the scenes Councillor Sciacca did his little bit. I must mention Regent Taxis. As I have said, a lot of our veterans are elderly and disabled. One of the reasons they were not going to Brisbane was that they physically could not manage it. I did write, quite unashamedly, to Regent Taxis asking them to help us&mdash;at no cost to us. I also wrote to a lot of hire car firms along those lines. Regent Taxis, our only taxi company on the Gold Coast, were very prompt. They have a fleet of 20 vehicles called maxi taxis, each one of which holds two wheelchairs. They made their entire fleet available to us, which was extraordinarily generous. In the event, we did not need the whole fleet but we did have quite a number of people in wheelchairs, particularly from nursing homes, who, when they were acquainted with the fact that this transport facility was available, did want to attend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stood on the saluting dais next to retired Colonel Henry Guinn: a World War I and II veteran, aged 95 and as spritely as can be&mdash;a fantastic man. When I saw this row of frail old folk being pushed in their wheelchairs down the street in the parade, I did a momentary panic and thought, `Oh, no. Don't tell me the taxi company let us down.' On the contrary, I was told that they certainly did not let us down, but that when all these veterans and widows of veterans arrived they said they wanted to be in the parade. They wanted to get out of the taxis, even though the weather was not very good that day. I think that just about exemplified the spirit of Victory in the Pacific Day on the Gold Coast. A lot of people really wanted to be in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the Moncrieff committee. The member for McPherson has already referred to his own committee but, in particular, I pay tribute to the three RSLs in my electorate and the representatives from those RSLs from Nerang, Southport and Surfers Paradise. Also I join in paying tribute with the member for McPherson to retired Lieutenant Colonel Don Keith, who worked extremely hard as chairman of the McPherson Australia Remembers Committee to the point where he actually made himself ill and had a heart attack the week before the parade and was not able to participate. The spade work he did made it relatively easy for someone to step into his place and that person was retired Major Joe Brain, who did an excellent job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also mention the schools' participation. I will not talk at great length about heart-warming it was to have the schools participating. Especially, I must mention The Southport School, which is an independent boys school&mdash;very long established on the Gold Coast&mdash;which has a very large cadet corps and a very fine military tradition and history, of which it is justifiably proud. Old boys of TSS have made a very major contribution to the defence of this nation in times when our armed services have been called upon. They also have a very fine musical tradition&mdash;a really outstanding one. They had two bands which played in the park as part of the ceremony. Unfortunately, it started to rain just before the end of the ceremony, so they were not able to fulfil their whole purpose because you cannot play musical equipment that involves electricity if it is raining. That is a very dangerous thing to do. That was a minor disappointment for them, I am sure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also three other cadet corps&mdash;navy, army and air force&mdash;which are not associated with schools, who participated in our parade in a very special way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the media, I must pay particular tribute to 91.7 Coast FM&mdash;a local ABC radio station on the Gold Coast, whose support was really outstanding. That morning as I was driving to the ceremony I flicked over all the radio stations to see what sort of support they were giving, given that it is very important&mdash;if you know the psyche of the Gold Coast&mdash;to give people that last-minute urge. The contribution of 91.7 Coast FM was wholehearted and outstanding. I really do thank them from the bottom of my heart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other person who must be mentioned is Paul Sharratt, who is well known to a lot of Australians. He, for many years, ran a non-stop music hall&mdash;non-stop in the sense that it performed seven days a week on the Gold Coast. Many Australians attended that music hall. He is still very much in show business. He was our MC for both our victory ceremony and the Victory in Europe concert. In fact, he organised entirely the Victory in Europe concert. Paul has been a gem as far as our whole activity is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, I must mention my staff, who worked till midnight night after night and over weekends, working that photocopier and folding and envelope machine, to get the word out; to make that little bit of publicity available that we could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some other organisations I must mention are: the Australian American Association on the Gold Coast, which is very active. It held what was supposed to be a victory ball but ended up being a victory dinner dance on 12 August and donated all the profits from that to Legacy. It was very successful. We were delighted to have as our special guest that evening Mary Leah, who is known as the `Angel of Changi', who now lives in Brisbane. She is a Chinese lady in her eighties, who smuggled medical supplies and food to Weary Dunlop for the benefit of ill Australian servicemen who were in Changi prison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention the Gold Coast Turf Club, which held a special Australia Remembers race meeting on 19 August, the Saturday after Victory in the Pacific Day. Every race was named after a noteworthy World War II battle, the main race being the Australia Remembers race. I mention the Gold Coast Harness Racing Club, which at their race meeting on 15 August also named a number of their races after Australia Remembers, the Land Army and so on. I mention the Salvation Army, which held the ecumenical remembrance church service for Moncrieff on 13 August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention those who entered into the spirit and held unofficial entertainment. The Paradise Centre&mdash;a major commercial centre in the heart of Surfers Paradise&mdash;put on free big band concerts and dances and so on and generally entered into the spirit of the occasion, and the Gold Coast Arts Centre also mounted a special concert the night before Victory in the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning and as I have said several times throughout our ceremonies, we did it all with smoke and mirrors, but we also did it all with a great deal of goodwill. To those who supported it in that way: thank you very much. I am sorry I may have had to introduce a jarring note, but I felt it should be put on the record that we did encounter a major difficulty with having our parade. The reason I put it onto the record is to give the heartfelt thanks of all involved to those who bailed us out of that difficulty and made it possible for us to do something special for the veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been interested, in listening to this debate, to hear different members mentioning their own family connections with World War II. I have no such similar family connection. I was born in Brisbane on 8 March 1942, two months to the day before the Battle of the Coral Sea, in the darkest days of World War II. It was really only looking at information that was available this year that has made me realise just how desperate those days were in Australia at the end of 1941 and early 1942 and how very difficult life must have been for everyone&mdash;ex-servicemen, yes, but also for the civilians, keeping the faith at home. I do, however, have an ex-serviceman husband, who served with the United States Marine Corps from Guadalcanal and through landings at Iwo Jima, Tarawa, Guam and Okinawa, so I did approach it with some personal feeling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I felt throughout that what we owed to those Australians who went and served in places like New Guinea&mdash;against apparently insuperable odds and under the most dreadful circumstances and at such terrible peril&mdash;meant that whatever any of us could do had to be done. Finally, I thank the minister for the wholehearted way he entered into this program and for making it possible to pay our small tribute to our local veterans on the Gold Coast. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Lots of memories are coming to the fore here today. Lots of stories are being told. Undoubtedly, I will have the opportunity to do such a thing myself. First, though, I would like to discuss the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment and Repeal Bill 1995, which is basically what we are here to speak about today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is repealing very obsolete legislation. When one looks at the summarisation of it, it is very good to note that it is going to repeal the legislation, without any financial impact. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) and his department are to be congratulated on the fact that we are not going to have to put out any more money in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 15 specific points being dealt with in this bill. I will home in on four which I find of particular interest. One is the amendment to the assessment of child related payments for blind service pensions. The aim here is to obviously bring about a little bit of fairness and equity for those blind service pensioners and to bring them into line with the social security blind pension payments for child related purposes. It has become fairly clear that the treatment of blinded veteran service pensioners with children does not equate with treatment of those who come under the Social Security Act. This part of the bill is going to bring them into line. It is proposed that the Veterans' Entitlements Act be amended so that it will finally treat blinded veteran service pensioners with children on a similar basis to those who come under the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is proposing to amend the act so that it will provide that the income and assets test for those veterans with dependent children would not apply to child related payments, dependent child add-on, commonly known as DCAO, guardian allowance and rent assistance. Also, any failure to pursue a maintenance claim would not result in the loss of DCAO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following on to that, another area that is also in need of attention is the calculation of the rate of rent assistance for blind veterans with no dependent children. This particular change is to correct an anomaly in the calculation of the rate of rent assistance for those veterans with no dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A blinded veteran's basic rate of service pension is not subject to the income and assets test. If eligible for rent assistance, the veteran is only entitled to the rent assistance amount that would have been made payable if that veteran had been an ordinary, non-blinded, invalidity service pensioner. The proposed amendment would ensure that a blinded pensioner should receive a minimum amount equal to the elements of the pension that are free of income and assets testing. Any rent assistance should require that the basic service pension be subjected to income and assets testing, but only to the extent of the rent assistance itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I make mention of is the remote area allowance. The remote area allowance is paid to the DVA service pensioners to compensate those residents for higher than normal costs associated with living in the remote areas of Australia. The definition of `remote area' includes references to certain parts of schedule 2 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1939 which deals with the income tax rebate zones and the areas they cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paragraphs of the income tax rebate zone A that nominate Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island as being included in that zone are not specified in the VEA definition of remote area. Therefore, service pensioner residents of Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island are currently ineligible to receive RAA, despite the fact that they reside in an area acknowledged to be remote. The proposed amendment, therefore, would ensure that service pensioner residents of those islands will be eligible to receive that pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final area I mention of this bill is that of rent assistance to war widows or widowers who receive a frozen rate of service pension. It has become fairly clear that the treatment of frozen rate service pensioner war widows and widowers with dependent children does not put them on a par with their counterparts who come under the Social Security Act. The latter do not receive any child related payments as part of their pension but instead are now eligible for additional family payment in the family payment system. In that system they receive the full additional family payment, which is not affected by their receipt of any disability pension. It is therefore proposed that the VEA be amended so that it treats frozen rate service pensioners on a similar basis to the Social Security Act frozen rate pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these changes&mdash;there are 15 in all, four of which I have mentioned&mdash;are good changes. They are outlawing other acts that are not applicable now. They are also putting people into line with the Social Security Act. The report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A fair go</EMPHASIS> commissioned by the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. John Faulkner, was brought down in 1994. When I was researching the background of what had happened to pensions and pensioners of Veterans' Affairs over the years, I was interested to look at the summary of that report. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report addresses a range of important issues relating to the present compensation arrangements for veterans and their dependants.</PARA>
<PARA>It followed a report of the Auditor-General which actually criticised some of the arrangements and a decision by the High Court of Australia in the Bushell case. One of the things that happens through this particular department, through the past minister and the current minister doing their jobs and through the departments doing their jobs, is that issues are kept constantly under review. We are constantly looking at where we are now and how it relates to today. That is what these changes are all about&mdash;where we are now, how it relates to today and bringing pensions in line with other similar pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were many recommendations in this particular report, which has commonly been known as the Baume report. Several of those recommendations have, I believe, now been implemented. This report was followed by another interesting report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The ageing agenda</EMPHASIS>. One of the main issues to come out of that, which is very pertinent today, is to have a more simplified approach to deeming&mdash;people with money to put away in investments, little nest eggs, and the way we rate and treat their pensions accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move on to the Australia Remembers celebrations. They have been many and varied right across Australia, including those in my own electorate. My main celebration for Australia Remembers will be the presentation of certificates of appreciation. This is to occur a little later in the year because I consider our current Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), who is sitting here in the chamber today, to be the person whom the majority of people who are to receive those certificates would like to see on that particular day. So we will have our celebration a little later in the year to fit in with the busy minister's schedule. That gives me time to organise a very large function, and we are looking forward to that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said by several members in this place, Australia Remembers is about a lot of things. It is about remembering the war effort contributions by military and civilian personnel. It is about educating those who grew up after the war. It is about educating the young people of today to ensure that the sacrifice which all those persons in that time gave will never, we hope and trust, have to be repeated by generations to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of what I have had to do in very recent times is to promote out into the community what these certificates are all about. It has been in some ways quite a difficult task. You have one section of the community that thinks the certificates are only for those who actually served in one of the forces in a war zone or here in Australia. Then you have the other group who have no realisation whatsoever of the other component&mdash;that is, the total civilian component. They know about the Land Army; they know about the people who built the roads and railways; they know about some of the people who worked in the munition factories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have started talking specifically about the Tasmanian effort&mdash;unfortunately I do not have the figures here today&mdash;with the thousands and thousands of socks that were knitted, the singlets that were bought or made, the balaclavas that were knitted, the hundreds of pints of blood that were donated and the comfort parcels that were packed. I have been busy educating the electorate of Bass that all those things mattered, and mattered dearly. Without that extra effort occurring, a lot of our men and women overseas would have been in much worse straits than they were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I have spoken, for instance, about blood donations, it has been interesting to hear the stories that people have to tell about how much blood they donated. At one time I said to my own 84-year-old mother, Lucie Crosc, `Mum, I know that you've given blood over your lifetime'&mdash;in fact, some years ago she got a commendation for giving blood over a period of 40 years; she has a rare blood type. I asked her, `What about during the war?' `Oh yes,' she said, `they were at me all the time.' So I use my mother as an example when telling people about that particular area. </PARA>

I said, `What was it?' He said, `Well, I trimmed and cut timber and made boxes for the munitions that were being produced in the various workshops around Launceston; would that be a reason for me to get a certificate?'

Everything is relevant, no matter how small&mdash;and they did it often; it was a daily and weekly event.

However, after thinking about it afterwards, I thought no, perhaps it was not. She said to me, `Silvia, did you realise that you contributed to the war effort?' I said, `Mum, I was born in 1939; I don't think that was any contribution whatsoever.' She then told me that when I was born&mdash;and I pass this message onto others because perhaps this is an effort that they made&mdash;I had a complete skin covering on my head, which was called a `caul', she told me, and it was considered to be a good luck charm for the navy. The sister-in-charge that night when I was born&mdash;and it was a Friday night, I found out&mdash;asked my mother whether she could have it to send away to the navy.

I would like to commend here, publicly, the George Town Primary School, the headmaster, the staff and the children for the vivid memories of the 1940s that they gave to all the people of George Town that night.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I would like to talk about a couple of issues that have come across my desk over the last few months that have occurred with respect to VP Day and the celebrations of the end of the war. One particular issue I would like to talk about is the Beaufort bomber. The Beaufort bomber, as members would know, featured in one of the ads for Australia Remembers over this year. It certainly is a very interesting aircraft and has had a very interesting history, and I would like to recount some of that today to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some months ago, I had some contact from a resident in Glen Waverley, a Mr Caddy&mdash;who, I think, is an uncle of the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus)&mdash;with respect to the question of the Beaufort bomber, which sent me on a bit of a trail when tracking down the answers to the questions: where were the Beaufort bombers and can one be restored? The situation is that the Beaufort is a bomber that the War Memorial is currently endeavouring to reconstruct, but at the moment there is no existing Beaufort in a condition which is able to be viewed by many people who would be interested. It actually played a very crucial role in the war effort, and it is a role that I certainly did not appreciate until I had made these inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to that, I would like to thank Crosby Dowling&mdash;or Bing Dowling, as he is known&mdash;the Secretary of the RAAF Beaufort Squadrons Association, Mr Arthur Goodall, a committee member, and a range of other people from that association for the information they have been able to help me gather together. I also want to thank, in particular, John White, the Curator of Aircraft at the Australian War Memorial. In part of my travels around searching up the question of the Beaufort, I spoke to and met with John White. He took me on a small private tour of the War Memorial installation out at Mitchell, where a lot of the larger items for exhibition are in the process of being restored or are in a situation where they are being repaired for further exhibition at the main War Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found that a very interesting tour, and I would certainly recommend that all members and the public go out there and have a look at it. They have tours that are available, and you will certainly see a range of other items that are not on show at the moment at the main War Memorial. John White provided me with a range of information about the history of the Beaufort. I would like to read you some notes that he provided to me regarding the question of the Beaufort and its role, because I think they tell a very interesting story about the Australian war effort during World War II. They state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the late 1930's Australia began an ambitious programme to mass produce bomber aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The chosen design was the British-designed Bristol Beaufort, a twin-engined machine with a crew of four that could carry either bombs or one torpedo. A fleet of Beauforts would patrol and protect Australia's vast coastline, and fly far out to sea to strike at an invasion force and its supply lines. Until early 1942 production was supported by Great Britain, and it was planned that some of the bombers would be supplied to the Royal Air Force. Only a few were delivered before the start of the Pacific war, and the remaining British orders were cancelled in April 1942. The first Australian Beaufort flew in October 1941. The last bomber version was delivered to the RAAF in September 1944, and the final transport conversion was completed in early 1945.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The production of the initial batch of Beauforts was an enormous effort for Australia. Each bomber needed 39,000 carefully manufactured parts. Drawing on a tiny industrial base and few skilled workers, the Beaufort Division of the Department of Aircraft Production (DAP) grew until it occupied seven large factories in three states.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three of these operations were run by the state railways, and produced the large sections of the aircraft. In New South Wales the Area Workshop at Chullora built the forward and tail end of the fuselage, as well as the undercarriage and the engine nacelles fitted to the wings. Newport, in Victoria, provided the rear fuselage and the tailplane. The three main wing sections came from Islington, in South Australia. The completed parts were carried by rail to two final assembly plants, branches of the Government Aircraft Factory located at Mascot in NSW and Fisherman's Bend in Victoria. Gun turrets were made at Fairfield, Victoria, and a repair and modification plant was set up at Essendon. At its peak the Beaufort Division had 8,500 employees, of which one third were women. Tens of thousands more people worked for 600 private sub-contractor companies, which included BHP and GMH. Few of the workers had any previous aircraft manufacturing experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the outbreak of war in the Pacific, the demand for new Beauforts increased. In total, 700 of the bombers were delivered between late 1941 and August 1944. 46 of these were later converted into transport aircraft, and were modified to carry freight and passengers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1941 the Beaufort was pressed into service to counter the Japanese threat, with new aircraft being flown direct to the New Guinea battlefronts and issued to units based in northern Australia that were raiding nearby Japanese bases including Timor. The Beaufort rapidly became the RAAF's main bomber type in the Pacific war, and was used by 19 front line squadrons of which 9 were all-Beaufort equipped. Other machines were sent to patrol the coasts, escort ship convoys or to fly with Operational Training Units in NSW and Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Almost half the Beauforts built in Australia were destroyed in service through enemy anti-aircraft fire, mechanical failure, random production faults, inexperience and the harsh conditions of military use in tropical areas. However, more worrying were a large numbers of unexplained crashes; dozens of aircraft did not return from patrols out to sea, while others blew up in the air or dived into the ground without any apparent reason.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Beaufort began to develop a bad reputation with its crews: at one Victorian training base the aircraft were dubbed `Gippsland Hailstones'. Detailed investigations revealed several problems, including a defective spring washer in the controls that could cause a fatal dive. With improved maintenance and experience the losses began to decline in late 1944.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first operational Beauforts reached New Guinea in 1942, and carried out bombing raids, supply dropping and sea patrols including torpedo strikes against Japanese ships. These early flights were undertaken by aircraft of 100 Squadron RAAF, staging through Port Moresby from bases in Australia. The squadron moved up to Milne Bay in September 1942, and was soon joined in New Guinea by other units. The bombers were used against targets on the mainland, as well as ranging as far as New Britain and the Shortland islands. For two months from October 1943 the Beauforts flew on night raids against the large Japanese garrison at Rabaul, part of a round-the-clock campaign mounted by the United States Fifth Air Force. The main Japanese forces in the area had been destroyed or isolated by the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1944-45 the Beaufort squadrons worked with Australian ground troops during a series of long and difficult campaigns against Japanese strong points along the north coast of New Guinea. Two units were included in 71 Wing, initially based at Goodenough Island and from June 1944 at Tadji. They were joined by 7 Squadron, and in May 1945 by 6 Squadron. The force was in easy reach of the fighting, and was soon able to dispatch 60 or more aircraft to each target. 15 Squadron RAAF spent the last six months of the war at Middleburg Island, Dutch New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The soldiers came to rely on the Beauforts, which flew large numbers of operations at low level to attack Japanese forces, supplies and communications. The bombers frequently raided Japanese strong points a few hundred meters in front of the Australian front lines, and the Army provided observers to coordinate these carefully planned attacks. Supplies were also delivered by air to ground forces isolated in the New Guinea jungle using a device called a `storepedo'. Designed by Australian pilot Ken Frewin, the storepedo was a cardboard container with a parachute that could be used to safely air-drop ammunition, food or medical supplies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Beaufort squadrons were dependent on their ground crews, who maintained the aircraft and prepared them for operations. Most of the work on the bombers was done in the open, in all weather conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian War Memorial has acquired and preserved the major sections of a Beaufort, a veteran of the New Guinea campaigns serialled A9-557. This machine was received by the RAAF in the first week of January 1944, and was delivered to 100 Squadron in July. It spent its entire operational career in New Guinea, operating from a number of airstrips including Vivigani (Goodenough Island) and Tadji (Aitape&mdash;on the north coast, about 150 km from border with present-day Irian Jaya).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Memorial's Beaufort carried out its first combat sortie, a bombing raid on Yakamul, on 10 July 1944. During 7 months of operational flying the aircraft completed over 103 missions, and dropped 146,000 pounds of bombs. It was flown by 19 different crews including those commanded by Flying Officer McNaughton (13 missions), Flying Officer Stan Polkinghorne (29 missions) and Flight Lieutenant Harry `Jack' Fowler (33 missions). It was evidently a reliable machine, and Fowler described A9-557 to his parents as his `beaut kite'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 20 January 1945 the aircraft was wrecked in a spectacular crash landing at Tadji. Returning from a raid on a village at Elimi with shell holes, and with a live bomb jammed in the bomb bay, it ran off the runway and collided with parked vehicles as well as a nearby building. FLTLT Fowler, his crew, and an Army observer all survived the crash landing of A9-557, although one man on the ground was killed. The damaged Beaufort was removed, carefully stripped of useful parts by a Repair and Salvage Unit, and dumped. It lay in the jungle at Tadji for 29 years. The main sections of the bomber were recovered and shipped to Melbourne in 1974 by a private collector, and these parts were obtained by the Memorial in 1992. During the last four years many additional Beaufort components&mdash;including sections from A9-461, A9-555 and A9-559&mdash;have been gathered in Australia, New Guinea and the United States. Using these, it is hoped to conserve and re-assemble A9-557.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Flight Lieutenant John `Jack' Fowler flew Beaufort A9-557 on 33 of its operations, including its final flight on 20 January 1945. Fowler was born in Perth in Western Australia, and served with a number of Beaufort units until August 1944, when he was transferred to 100 Squadron. Each aircraft was operated by a crew of four, who stayed together during their `tour' of . . . front line service. An experienced and careful pilot, Fowler usually flew with Flying Officers Waite, Shipman and Smith. The four men spent much of their time together, both on and off duty. At Tadji the crews were kept busy, sometimes completing four or five operations in one day. In their spare time recreation was simple: swimming, resting or writing letters home during daylight, and films at an open-air cinema or card games in the mess at night if no raids were planned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unmarried, Fowler kept in close contact with his parents and family. As the early part of 1945 passed it seemed likely that he would survive to return home. Losses in the squadron were low, and he had nearly completed his tour. However, some months earlier a defective batch of bomb fuses had been produced in Australia, and by March they had arrived at Tadji. On 13 March 1945 one of the fuses was fitted to a bomb loaded in Fowler's aircraft A9-650, and it exploded prematurely when released over a target at Maprik. The aircraft was caught in the blast, and all the crew were killed instantly. After the war an RAAF team located the wreckage and recovered the bodies. According to a personal log book, still preserved by his family, `Jack' Fowler completed 78 operational flights and nearly two years as a Beaufort pilot.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 14 August 1945 a formation of Beauforts set out from Tadji to raid a Japanese-held village near Wewak. The Beauforts dropped their bombs, and descended to low level to machine gun the target area. As the last aircraft completed its attack the formation was contacted by radio and ordered to break off the attack. The war was over, and it was time for the Beauforts and their crews to return home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bombers still had useful work to do. For weeks Beauforts flew over the now-peaceful jungles and the abandoned battlefields of the south-west Pacific, dropping leaflets to isolated Japanese forces telling them that the war had ended. The wings of several aircraft were also painted with large surrender instructions in Japanese characters, which could be read from the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the post-war world there was little need for the Beauforts, and within a few months most of the surviving airworthy bombers were flown to storage sites in Australia. A few were used for experimental tasks, including aerial crop-spraying trials in 1946-47. By the early 1950's the surplus machines had disappeared, broken up for scrap aluminium. The last known intact Australian Beaufort was destroyed in 1956.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, at isolated spots and abandoned airfields in Australia and Papua New Guinea wrecked and abandoned Beauforts lingered on. Local people used the metal and fittings for many purposes far removed from their original purpose. In Australia farmers found uses for fuel tanks, hydraulic rams, wheels and odd pieces. In New Guinea the aircraft were a source of metal for fences and tools: at the isolated former RAAF air base of Vivigani, on Goodenough Island, an entire village was built with Beaufort parts. 50 years later it still stands, a practical and enduring monument to the Australian Beaufort.</PARA>
<PARA>As you can see, the Beaufort is an important aircraft. The crews who flew them are a very significant part of the history of the Second World War and Australia's involvement. The fact is that it was a very major component of the Australian war effort at home also, with so many people involved in the construction and so many different companies involved in the subcontracting in order to provide Beaufort aeroplanes to the forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope and pray that the situation with the War Memorial is such that in the years to come, and sooner rather than later, we can see a situation where those Beaufort crews who remain and those people who helped construct it will be able to attend the War Memorial and see a Beaufort in all its glory, reconstructed in a way which shows exactly what a major part of the war effort it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was mentioned earlier, the Australia Remembers program has been a very significant part of ensuring that Australia as a whole understands what occurred some 50 years ago. The circumstances of that courage and sacrifice exhibited both at home and abroad are a very significant part of our history. The thing that I have really enjoyed about the Australia Remembers program has been the amount of anecdotes and stories that have come out. When I was younger I read a lot about the wars, particularly the Second World War, and I thought I knew a fair bit about it&mdash;the dates of battles, the times of battles, the circumstances, the sacrifice and the courage. But I think one thing that I have found very interesting about it has been the anecdotes that have come out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is at the table. I recall being at Spencer Street Station in Melbourne some months ago for a re-enactment, if you like, of a troop train going off and sending it off. I was there with the President of the Victorian RSL, Bruce Ruxton. Mr Ruxton endeavoured to present back to Vicrail a teaspoon which he had mislaid on his person over 50 years ago and had found and had then endeavoured to return it to the minister for transport in Victoria, Allan Brown. It certainly was quite an interesting occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know from talking to my father, who was a teenager towards the end of war, I think, of the situation at his primary school. I always remember a story he told me about having air raid warnings and drills at the secondary school in Rosebud on the Mornington Peninsula in the outskirts of Melbourne. I think in one of their first air raid drills they trooped out, went to the designated area and lay down on the ground. The problem was that there was an ants nest there, so they were not lying down on the ground for very long. I will not go into the graphic details of how he described the activity, but it certainly was amusing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to my local area, the Australia Remembers program has been embraced throughout the electorate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that I have been very pleased about is that in the metropolitan part of my electorate and also on Phillip Island local historical societies and councils have embraced the idea of getting together oral histories of people who lived through that time and can provide their recollections both on the domestic front and on those abroad. I think there cannot be too much of that at this time because essentially, although this is a commemoration of a sacrifice that occurred some 50 years ago, the fact is that it must go on from here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The generation of today must learn more about what happened, because not only is it an important part of our history but the generation of tomorrow must ensure that documentation and information are available to ensure that they, too, can appreciate what occurred at that time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very impressed with the work of the Phillip Island Historical Society and also the city of Casey in getting those sorts of details together to ensure that people in those areas will understand what occurred at that time and the significant role that was played by those areas in the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been an opportunity for a lot of local communities in smaller country towns to take an initiative which was badly overdue with things like avenues of honour and restoration of shrines. Many of these are falling into disrepair or in fact in some towns did not exist. It really has helped to bond those communities together in understanding the significance of what occurred.

The president of that RSL club is Kevin Duke. The other club is the Geelong RSL Club, whose president is Mr Fred Gliddons and which is located over the river in the electorate of Corangamite. It does service many of the veterans from the Geelong community. Both these RSL clubs give great support to veterans and their widows. They do a wonderful job throughout the Geelong community and participate very actively in community life of the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Geelong region is also fortunate to be serviced by a Department of Veterans' Affairs network office, which the minister, incidentally, opened some time ago. In the past year the number of contacts with veteran pensioner recipients has tripled. This is an indication of the better service being provided to Geelong veterans and the wider veteran community by this government. It is estimated that we have in the Geelong region between 6,000 and 7,000 pensioner recipients. Those people are mostly over 70, and they have very specific needs in the areas of health and general care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give congratulations to the staff of that office for their care and compassion for the veterans of the Geelong community. Kerry Mills works in the health area for veterans, and Simon Townsend works in the pension entitlements area. They are ably backed up by Kerry Whelan, who works there on a part-time basis. There is a community health worker in Warrnambool who assists the office in servicing the wider western district region of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department performs basically two roles in the region. It provides assistance to veterans in the area of health and it addresses their needs as far as their pensioner entitlements are concerned. As I said before, with the veterans' population now in the over-70s cohort, the management of their health needs is a prime issue for the wider community. Providing advocacy support for those veterans, making sure that they are aware of their medical entitlements and that they are fully utilised, and liaising with health providers, is a very important role provided by the department in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the government's initiatives in the aged care area in the Geelong community are concerned, we have recently seen a $343,000 allocation to the North Bellarine Hostel for the Aged. If it had not been for the allocation that was made under the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the minister, this facility would not have proceeded. The federal government contribution to that facility exceeded $1.3 million in total. The allocation by the Department of Veterans' Affairs was greatly appreciated and ensured that this project proceeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move now to the provisions of this bill. It is essentially a bill which undertakes a series of housekeeping legislative amendments. It identifies and rectifies anomalies in the legislation, it discards outdated provisions and it brings the veterans' affairs legislation in line with amendments to the Social Security Act in the wake of the 1995-96 budget. I do not propose to canvass all of the legislative amendments covered in this bill. However, I would like to highlight some measures covered by the legislation which relate to the government's main objectives of the bill which I referred to previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of legislation passes through this House and the parliament. That is a reflection of the complexity of the issues that modern legislatures are called upon to address in an industrialised democracy such as Australia. Periodically, it is necessary to examine and review legislation that has been enacted in the past to determine its continuing relevance today. That process of review has been undertaken by the Attorney-General's portfolio with legislation relating to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The repeal of the War Service Homes Agreement Act 1932 and the War Service Homes (South Australia) Agreement Act 1934 is an outcome of such a review. These acts have been assessed and found to have no useful purpose today&mdash;hence their repeal. The two acts I have mentioned relate to agreements made between the Commonwealth and the commissioners of the state banks of Victoria and South Australia concerning war service homes. The passage of time has rendered past agreements somewhat irrelevant&mdash;hence the current move in this legislation to take those acts off the books, so to speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I would like to deal with relates to the exemptions in this act of credit entries in exchange trading systems from the income test provisions of the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986. For many pensioners an exchange trading system can be an important way for them to work cooperatively with other pensioners in providing some very basic goods and services without recourse to an exchange of money. It is a means by which veteran pensioners can keep in touch with their former labour market skills and maintain some contribution to their own welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly not the government's intention to treat such activities as income for the purposes of pension rate assessments. That would discourage participation in these cooperative endeavours. Therefore, the government has exempted these exchange trading activities from income assessment purposes under this particular act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter I would like to comment upon relates to the provisions in this bill to allow for the overseas portability of carer service pensions. The amendments provide for retention of a carer service pension by a carer where they accompany a person being cared for out of Australia up to a period of three years. This particular measure is aimed at easing the load of carers who are caring for severely handicapped veterans who may be at some stage on a temporary visit outside of Australia. The government appreciates the tremendous work which is being done by the carers of our veterans. This measure is an acknowledgment of that contribution that they make. Many may regard it as a small measure, but I think it is a major measure for the carers concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my concluding remarks on this legislation I would like to commend the minister once again for his handling of this portfolio. That expert handling is measured by the gains that were made by the veterans' affairs portfolio in the 1995-96 budget and, of course, the magnificent Australia Remembers program, which has been referred to by members who have spoken previously in this debate. It owes much of its success to the energy and compassion of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the member for Bowman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I go to the initiatives that were brought down in the 1995-96 budget for veterans, we can see a range of measures that the government has added in this very important portfolio to improve the welfare of the veterans community of this country. I refer to the aged care initiative to which the government provided some $50 million in the 1995-96 budget over a period of five years. As I mentioned previously in this debate, the North Bellarine Hostel for the Aged received an amount in excess of $343,000. It was enough to tip the balance for the local community that was struggling to find the money to complete the funding arrangements and get this project under way. It was the timely intervention of the minister and the Department of Veterans' Affairs that enabled this very important social justice initiative to proceed in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995-96 budget also saw an expansion of health care services to some 140,000 war widow and service pensioners. For the first time, the veterans community will now have access to chiropractic services. Another measure that was introduced in the context of the budget was the $5 million that the government provided for research into the health needs of veterans. That is ongoing research that must be undertaken to ensure that the measures that the government introduces are tailored to meet the very real and specific needs of veterans not only in the community of Geelong but across the length and breadth of Australia. I am very pleased that in the context of the budget the government provided $4.1 million for younger veterans to provide them with easier access to post-traumatic stress disorder treatment programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many members have referred in this debate to the activities of the Australia Remembers program and what it has meant to the veterans communities and the wider communities in their electorates. Those very favourable sentiments are echoed by all members of this House on whatever side of the political fence we might lie. As far as the Australia Remembers program in Geelong is concerned, like other electorates, my own engaged in a variety of activities which ranged from victory balls, victory concerts, alternative cinema presentations, oral history projects that involved the youth of our schools, exhibitions that reached out into the wider community and, of course, the victory march itself. I would like to acknowledge the contribution of the two committees that existed in the Geelong region&mdash;one in the Corio electorate and the other in the electorate of Corangamite, which is occupied by my long term foe and opponent, the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As many people would know in the electorate, on matters of real relevance to the region and the welfare of people in that region, we do cooperate. This was one program where committees in both electorates&mdash;a Liberal and a Labor electorate&mdash;were able to come together under the banner of the Australia Remembers program to deliver a range of activities to veterans in the Geelong community and the wider community that really highlighted what we as a government were attempting to achieve in this particular program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the minister, the honourable member for Bowman, I am happy to report that in the Geelong region we did have a wide breadth of activity as part of that program. I was very pleased with the way the program gained momentum as the year progressed. I know very much of the compassion and care that the honourable member has for the veterans community in my electorate and throughout the length and breadth of the nation. That momentum that built up over the year was very much attributable to the personal efforts and the commitment and enthusiasm that the minister brought to this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the veterans community in Geelong is very thankful for the resources that were provided by the minister and for the personal efforts that he made. I think that was reflected&mdash;and he knows this&mdash;in the warmth of his reception in Geelong when he visited my electorate in the last two weeks. It is, perhaps, the last chance for people of the Corio electorate to thank World War II veterans in their own way for the sacrifice that they made for our freedom. It has been a successful program and I commend the minister for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is simply an ongoing pattern of legislation by this government which has brought to the veterans community of Australia much needed resources to address their ongoing needs. Nobody in the veterans community really doubts the commitment of this government when it comes to the veterans community of this nation. I commend this bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now, now. In summing up, I wanted to thank everybody who spoke on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment and Repeal Bill 1995. I know there has been a fair bit said about the program of Australia Remembers. I will not comment on that because I intend at some later stage to make a statement to this House and give other members the opportunity to say something with respect to their own activities. I know there are a lot of members who may wish to do that. If we can arrange to fit it into the House's program, I am sure we will give members a chance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to speak about a number of matters that were raised by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), who genuinely brings up matters affecting the veterans community from time to time. On this occasion, there were two particular matters causing him some concern. I would like to reply to them. Firstly, there was the matter of the Vietnam veterans mortality study. He came up with some figures on the numbers of people who committed suicide who were Vietnam veterans. Of course, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence about that. As part of the budget&mdash;I think it was last year's budget&mdash;we agreed to do a mortality study. This is not just something which my department is doing; it is something which is being done by an independent organisation and it is being overseen by representatives of the ex-service organisations, including representatives of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The progress of this study has been satisfactory because we are trying to ensure that we involve the ex-service community, the veterans community, as much as we can so that we have a transparent process. There is nothing here that we want to hide. In fact, I am sure that my department and the government generally would like to know what the facts are. How many people in fact have committed suicide? Is there an appreciably greater number of deaths amongst our Vietnam veterans community as against the general community? There are all these sorts of matters. Indeed, although the Veterans' Entitlements Act does not allow payment for compensation in a common law sense, for instance, for exposure to chemicals, there is a question that I agreed at the request of the Vietnam Veterans Association to place in the questionnaire to find out if there had been any birth defects in their children. This is something which is outside my portfolio, certainly in terms of the Veterans Entitlement Act. Again, so that we can get some proper database, we thought that we would include that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to assure the honourable member for McPherson that that is proceeding at the quickest possible rate. I hope that when we do get an appropriate result of this study and I can present it, we will be a lot better educated as to what the truth of this matter is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I want to raise&mdash;again, it was raised by the honourable member for McPherson&mdash;relates to a campaign by the Domiciliary Nurses Association, which has only recently been formed. I am looking at a press release from them which says, `Call for action to protect veteran care at home'. It is not surprising that at this time of Australia Remembers, when there is a great deal of emphasis and focus on our veterans community, there will be organisations that will use that opportunity to try to gain public attention for their campaigns. I guess it is a legitimate tactic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, this has been happening now for some days and I have not yet responded publicly because I do not really think that I need to. I want to read into the record a draft press release which I think has gone out. Certainly, it says it all. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Best nursing care for vets is top priority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Veterans' Affairs today strongly reiterated its commitment to providing quality community nursing care to all eligible veterans and war widows who need such care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Deputy Commissioner of NSW, Geoff Stonehouse, said allegations that community nursing services to veterans were to be eliminated were totally unfounded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The main aim of the Repatriation Commission's community nursing program is to encourage veterans and war widows to remain as independent as possible for as long as they can," he said. "We also have a commitment to ensure that our veterans and war widows receive the highest standard of health and community care available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department has also identified a degree of over-servicing by some private nursing organisations."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Stonehouse said the NSW office of the DVA had begun negotiations with the State Health Department to increase the use of publicly funded nursing organisations. The DVA will purchase these services from the State on behalf of eligible veterans and war widows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I want to make it quite clear that any changes, when finally negotiated, will affect new clients only and these people will receive the highest standard of care possible. Veterans and war widows who are currently receiving community nursing service from a private nursing agency and who require on-going care, will continue to receive that care through the agency."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Any suggestion that referrals for home nursing will cease is totally misleading."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Stonehouse said home support services for veterans and war widows should be arranged through the Home and Community Care (HACC) Program, run by the Commonwealth Government's Department of Health and Human Services. "Nurses are not expected to provide home support services as it contravenes both the community nursing standards set by the nursing profession and the aims of the Repatriation Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Throughout Australia, the DVA receives an excellent, quality service from publicly funded community nursing organisations. Their ability to provide both quantity and quality of service is clearly demonstrated in both Queensland and Western Australia where the vast majority of the Department's community nursing services are provided by the public sector."</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to read some 1992-93 statistics, which show that states using the highest proportion of private agencies also have the highest average cost per client. These statistics are set out in a table on the document I have. The state average cost per client, for instance, in New South Wales is $2,900, where the use of private agencies is 93 per cent. In Victoria, the average cost per client is $1,500 and the use of private agencies is 30 per cent. In Queensland, the average cost per client is $550 and the use of private agencies is 20 per cent. In South Australia, it is $980, with 25 per cent usage. In Western Australia, it is $780 and the use of private agencies is nil. In Tasmania, it is $1,700 and the use of private agencies is 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very high proportion of the moneys that we spend in our department on community nursing is in New South Wales, where 93 per cent of it is private. We hardly get any complaints about community nursing in the other states. I have a responsibility as the appropriate minister to ensure that we get the best value out of the dollar without in any way affecting the service that we give to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we can arrange that through the public sector, and the service is as good, if not better in some instances, I cannot allow the commercial considerations of private nursing services to come into the equation.

Last week, the poet Philip Hodgins died at the tragically early age of 36.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been written and spoken about Ted's football life. I would like to highlight some of the more endearing features of this unique sporting hero and personality of Australia. Ted Whitten was not only larger than life but a great lover of life. He brought to his football, his work and his personal life an exuberance, a vitality&mdash;indeed a passion&mdash;that became his personal hallmark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ted was a leader on and off the field, and he possessed that larrikin sense of humour that brought great laughter and happiness to many people. I would like to read a story by his fellow K-Rock commentator of 10 years, Brian Brushfield, about one of those humorous incidents. Brushfield recounts the incident:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On one occasion, I was sitting back with my feet on the bench and my mouth full when he said "Crisis in front of the players' race, cross to you Brushy". So in one second I swallowed the food, put the headphones back on, but when I got my binoculars up and focused there were two trainers sweeping up the deposit left by the police horses. Teddy loved it.</PARA>
<PARA>That was his sense of humour. Teddy had a very Australian and larrikin sense of humour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In playing terms, E.J. was a legend in his own day. Few could match the comprehensive skills that he brought to the game. He was a prodigious kicker of the ball. He was a fierce tackler. His ball handling skills were sure and complete, and he could leap and mark against men much taller and stronger than he. His evasive skills were finely honed, but when the heavy-duty work had to be done, Whitten ran in a straight line at his opponents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ted was an expert at the game, even as a player. He was always doling out advice to umpires on the interpretation of the rules of the game. But it was his unbridled passion for our great Australian game and his larger than life personality that made him a giant in the code. As we say in footy parlance, Mr Football has finally hung up his boots. But the outpouring of sentiment in Melbourne is ample testament to the respect and esteem in which he was held by the Victorian footballing public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly pleased that the E.J. Whitten Bridge in Victoria, named after Teddy, was built with money provided by this federal government. We all marvelled at the courage Ted showed in bearing his crippling cancer and other illnesses. His triumphant lap of honour at the recent State of Origin game at the MCG is etched in Victoria's sporting memory forever. Teddy never let the Big V down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, the all-party parliamentary Australian football group was formed. On behalf of the members of that group, I extend to the Whitten family our sympathy on his passing. He was a larger than life Aussie Rules sporting hero who really did run with the ball and die with his boots on. But then again, some legends will just never die. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, earlier this year, as a result of numerous complaints from people in the electorate of Lilley and right around Australia, I and many others requested the government to set up the PSA inquiry into bank fees and charges. When the PSA came to Brisbane I made submissions to the inquiry, based on the hundreds of phone calls, letters and surveys sent to my office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate there is community outrage about some of the practices of leading banking institutions. Simply put, people believe that bank fees and charges have been spiralling out of control and that it is lower income earners who are paying. To the people, the banks have simply given up their role of being part of the community and really only want to be part of the top end of town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public believe that being competitive is about bringing charges down, not clubbing average customers over the head. Among the public there is a sense of rage that ordinary people are being shanghaied into paying more to make up for the management mistakes of the kind that gave Christopher Skase enough money to retire to Mallorca. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central theme of all the submissions made to me is that fees and charges target the people least able to afford them and least able to rearrange their affairs to avoid extra costs. In fact, it could be argued that the banks are deliberately trying to rid themselves of low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the inquiry a number of submissions were made to the PSA on the question of the social responsibility of banks. In particular, bank representatives denied at that inquiry any overall social responsibility. In effect, they constructed an elaborate argument that social responsibility is inconsistent with deregulation and the free market. That, of course, is nonsense. The sort of economic fundamentalism practised by the banks at the inquiry was used to avoid the real question: should there be a system of user pays and, if so, what level should we have?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July, the PSA brought down its report. It concluded that there was a case for user pays but that the present regime is mis-skewed and discriminates particularly against low income earners who cannot keep more than $500 in their accounts throughout the month. More importantly, the report found that access to the system is a necessity of modern living so there needs to be at least a low priced option for those seeking to gain entry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PSA said that the market should provide satisfactory no-frills accounts and it proposed that it monitor progress of the banks towards a fairer and more efficient fee regime. Importantly, the PSA showed that, as is often the case, much of the propaganda of the banks presented in the media and to the inquiry was inaccurate and clearly nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments which have been put about by the banks and their fellow travellers over the past few months have veered from Alice in Wonderland to the haughty go-away style of President Chirac, putting down any critic as irrational. The Alice in Wonderland approach came up in a four-page glossy pamphlet circulated by the banks but carrying the name of accounting firm Coopers and Lybrand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They came up with the claim that establishment of a basic banking product account would cost the banks and the community $1 billion a year. Of course, no figures were given, no calculations to verify that assessment. What do they think a basic banking service means? Serving champagne to every customer or caviar over the counter? Clearly, that is nonsense and, clearly, the PSA report demonstrates those claims as nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The PSA was unequivocal in rejecting the main plank of the banks' arguments when it said, `There is no direct link between the cost of the account and the amount of money in the account.' The banks, in the face of this critique and bitter community criticism during the inquiry and after the release of the report, made it clear that they would move towards the introduction of a basic no-frills account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received these assurances on numerous occasions from representatives of the banks. Since that time, the banks have been back-pedalling, hoping that the issue would go away. Now we have the blatant example of the Commonwealth Bank flouting the spirit and letter of the report. As the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said yesterday, this is simply not good enough and the Commonwealth Bank simply must observe the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The banks have to stop their discrimination against lower income earners. They occupy a privileged position in our economy. They have enormous market power. The government strives, through its competition policy, to reduce that market power, but if it cannot be reduced through competition policy, then, of course, it must be reduced by other means, including regulation. We need from the banks a basic banking product, a no-frills account. It can be done, and the banks should act forthwith to provide that account. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the adjournment to comment on the speech made yesterday by the Premier of Victoria about the role of the states in terms of constitutional change. I find it fascinating that within the great tradition of the Liberal Party there has always been an endearment to things which are British, including the Westminster system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that one of the great things to come out of our relationship with Great Britain has been the Westminster system. But nowhere more significantly than in Victoria has that system been under such constant attack. The whole concept of the Westminster system was to have an independent public service which was capable of giving ministers of the Crown independent advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been a minister, I take the view that there are two kinds of ministers: there are ministers who run their departments and there are those who are run by their departments. But, by and large, the advice that is tendered is objective. It has come through a process in which a whole range of principles and policies are analysed. From my experience&mdash;I am certain that I speak for other ministers&mdash;although one does not always accept the recommendations, in the great majority of cases the advice is sound; it has been properly researched; and one is able to take that advice with confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This independent public service protects the minister; that is, you are not in a situation where it is possible or appropriate that you say, `Look, there's a particular tender process. I know there are three people who have tendered, but there's someone else I really think you ought to think about and whose tender ought to be accepted.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A situation has occurred in my state, which has had great public servants who are available to advise not merely ministers of the Crown but also members of the opposition, where there has been a demeaning of the public servants and the hiring of what can only be described as political hit men. These are people whose salary emoluments are probably the highest in the Commonwealth, who are on contracts for a period of two to three years, and who so long as they comply with the minister's directions will be okay. At the end of the day, I believe we have a system which is eroding the whole concept of independent advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are great dangers with this kind of system. When the Premier was elected, most Victorians believed that they were going to get a Hamer style government or perhaps a Bolte style government. They did not believe that they would finish up with a situation, as is now evident, where at every point Victoria is being divided in such a way that I believe it will be disastrous for my state. If this government continues along this path, we are going to finish up with a system catering for a privileged class of people with access to the government who contribute in large sums to the political process as opposed to a system catering for the rights of the ordinary citizen&mdash;the people who are now being told what is good for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of my own experience I believe quite sincerely that, whatever its imperfections, the Westminster system is absolutely a major part of our democratic system. To see it being eroded in the way in which it has been is a matter of deep concern. On other occasions I will deal in this House with the issue of the erosion of the Westminster system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is, I must say, nice to be back in the harness, so to speak, in the parliament and in the Main Committee. It is interesting that the particular matter we are debating this morning was actually tabled quite a long time ago. The formal report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New directions in Australia's overseas aid program</EMPHASIS>, the ministerial policy paper and the fifth annual report to parliament on Australia's development cooperation program, is dated February 1995, and the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) of course made his statement on 2 March 1995. So we are actually almost six months down the track. My understanding is that a number of things have in fact moved on since this report was tabled and, therefore, we are talking a little about some history but also about a very active area at the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that this whole area of overseas aid and Australia's development cooperation program is one that could almost have the subtitle of `It isn't as simple as it seems'. The reason I say that is that most Australians would be kindly disposed towards our overseas aid effort: both the taxpayer funded money that comes from the government and also the money that is collected from the public. When you look at some of the public subscriptions that go on, the vast amounts of money that are pumped into many of those NGOs and the money that is then spent overseas, the Australian public is, by and large, very generous, and there have been a number of issues during the course of this year that have brought these matters very much to newsworthy attention. In spite of that good intention and considerable support, the reality of how you spend that money and where you spend that money&mdash;and, in fact, the problems of actually being able to spend that money in the way that one would like to see it do the good that it is intended to do&mdash;can often be very difficult indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perhaps indicative that, even in this relatively slim document, the actual tabled report&mdash;which is in three sections: `Recent developments in Australia's aid program', `New directions in social development in the aid program' and `New directions in humanitarian relief in the aid program'&mdash;covers a very considerable range of activities. It talks about the South Pacific and PNG; about Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos; and about Africa. It also talks about the social sector and cross-sectoral developments, the environment, micro-enterprise development, private sector linkages, refugees and relief programs, the NGO program, volunteers, research, aid effectiveness, policy frameworks and so forth. So it is a very complex area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Bilney, in his speech, probably encapsulated what the government is on about at the moment, and I will talk a bit about some of my views. But I think we need to understand where the government sees itself as going. He encapsulated it when he said in his statement to the House that the government's policy framework for poverty reduction has three major components: firstly, encouragement of sustainable economic growth; secondly, investment in human resources through education, health, capacity-building and social sector development; and, thirdly, the provision of safety nets and poverty targeting, including humanitarian relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there would be too many of us who would argue with those as principles and aims. It is important that we recognise the efforts that Australia does make as a nation, and it is important that there is a degree of continuity between governments and a degree of cross-party support for many of these things. But I do have to chide the government at least gently on one particular matter that is in this report: the statement made in the report that claims that we are now ranked 13th amongst the 22 OECD donors in terms of aggregate aid volume. Our aid currently stands at 0.33 per cent of GNP, substantially better than the 0.3 per cent figure for OECD donors combined, says the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his statement the minister also claims that we are one of only four of those 22 nations which spent a bit more money in the last financial year than we did in previous financial years. However, given that most people who take an interest in this sector would like to think that we are moving ever closer to the accepted international target of 0.7 per cent, and we are not even halfway there at the moment, that is a matter for regret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government prides itself on improving aid substantially and moving in that direction. It has had 12 years in which to achieve that figure. When you measure success against those real targets, it is somewhat disappointing. I am not going to stand here and make some outrageous claim that the coalition, when it wins the next election, is suddenly going to go to 0.7 per cent, but I would certainly hope that we would all work towards getting governments of whichever persuasion to up the amount of money that we contribute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that has happened to me since this report came out is that I have become much more closely associated with this area. The House will be aware that the minister has set up a advisory committee called COPAC, the Code of Practice Advisory Committee, for non-government organisations&mdash;NGOs&mdash;particularly for those that operate overseas. This is an area that is often fraught with some difficulty and the recent CARE case has highlighted that difficulty. But there are not only the concerns that were raised by the particular instance of CARE; there has also been an Industry Commission inquiry. The Industry Commission report, although it has not yet been publicised, as I understand it, is likely to raise a number of concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission was looking at not only those charities that function overseas, but also charities that work at home. The Industry Commission was looking at the whole question of accountability and accounting and reporting and those sorts of issues. That will involve changing federal legislation and coordinating those changes with the states. The minister has set up this committee and it is charged with providing a code of practice in the short term until the Industry Commission can come up with a more viable longer term process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose this morning to canvass the issues being considered by that committee or what that committee is likely to find. It is going to report to the minister on 31 August and so it would be inappropriate for me to talk about that committee and its deliberations before that. All I will say is that I have found the process of taking evidence and working on that committee to be very educative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that there are a number of issues to consider. This is why at the start of my comments I made the remark that, when you talk about aid, it is not as simple as it seems. There are a number of issues that come to mind, not least of which is that many governments and private organisations, when they go overseas and try to provide aid to countries in need, often encounter this very difficult dichotomy of paternalism versus providing some long-term help, some self-help. They try to set in place sustainable improvements rather than just give handouts and then walk away and find that the mountain falls in straight afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are simple problems of accounting. What accounting standards do you use? What exchange rates do you use? Do you send your money via some international headquarters? Does it lose value on its way through that headquarters to its final destination? Do you burden aid organisations, particularly the volunteer ones, with onerous administrative and accounting requirements and reporting requirements?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bear in mind that with many of those organisations we are not just talking about government grants; we are talking about organisations that get tax deductibility and, therefore, it is a charge on the taxpayer. Many of those organisations would find that onerous reporting requirements would detract from their direct work. How do you deal with donations in kind? How do you define how much of your budget, in an aid organisation, is going to be spent on administration? What is administration?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded by the Fred Hollows Foundation, for example, that they spend much of their money in this country on research and then, having perhaps in the current financial year spent a large amount of their income on research and developed some new minute lenses, they will set up factories in overseas countries and produce them relatively cheaply in order to put their programs in place on the ground, whereas other organisations may have a far higher proportion of their funds going directly overseas every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year I had the opportunity, as part of a study tour, of visiting Thailand and Indonesia. World Vision were very good in setting up a number of visits for me whilst I was overseas. I might mention that World Vision moved from their old headquarters in Melbourne to a new headquarters and only made one mistake with their new headquarters&mdash;they put it literally on the other side of the road from the boundary of my electorate. If they had been on the other side of the particular road they would have been in my electorate and, of course, that would have been great. Nevertheless, I am sure that the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) is pleased to have them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, with the assistance of World Vision when I went overseas I was able to go and look at not only what they were doing, but also some of the things that the Australian government was doing overseas. For example, in Thailand I travelled up to Chiang Mai in the north, and from Chiang Mai, having visited some hospitals and organisations in the town, I went out into the country, into the hills in northern Thailand where the AIDS problem is absolutely horrendous. I think there are few people in this country who understand that, in places like northern Thailand, the incidence of AIDS is running at about 20 per cent amongst the women&mdash;and this is quite young women, as well. Therefore there is a tremendous amount that needs to be done. The Thai government was very slow indeed in coming to grips with this and it is Australian aid that is starting to make some impact on the AIDS issue in Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Indonesia, one goes to Jakarta and hears from the government about some of the wonderful things the government says it is doing for its country. But, in fact, I went just to the outskirts of Jakarta and saw aid programs where they were installing basic facilities, such as water, in ordinary housing. I went and visited young boys and girls who would not have been going to school if it had not been for Australian aid being pumped into that country. I went up to Bandung in the hills and saw an official Australian aid project helping to sort out and rationalise the control of the railway system. My concern there, I have to say, was that once Australian expertise was withdrawn I was not too sure how long that system would actually stand up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What worried me, having seen those things in Indonesia, was that I was also taken by my hosts to see the Indonesian aircraft factory where billions of dollars are being spent to produce an aeroplane that is hardly commercial, to be honest. Billions of dollars in high technology and equipment are being spent to try to leapfrog that country into the technological age&mdash;and not very successfully&mdash;when basics are not being put in place for their own population. Three or four years ago I went to Tonga as part of a delegation to the South Pacific Forum. Again, it seemed to me that, whilst a lot of our aid money was going to buy Mercedes for relatively junior bureaucrats, every primary school I went to did not have a decent waste water or guttering system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there is a place for humanitarian aid and there is a place for enterprise development, it seems to me that the amount of money and how best we spend that money are, in fact, major problems. There are difficulties of disposal and it seems to me that we have not yet got the process right. Nevertheless, having said that, I think we have to continue to try. As time goes by and we develop better ways of making sure our money actually reaches the target, I am sure we will start to give people back some self-respect and some hope for the future in many of these developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that earlier this month I was in Malaysia. Malaysia, of course, is a country that no longer takes aid from us and has made giant strides in the last couple of decades. It seems to me that we should be aiming to get many of the countries that we are currently helping to that stage where they can in fact help themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to speak in this debate. It is a pleasure, too, to follow the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), whose continuing interest in this area I have noticed for some years. I compliment him on the work that he has done. He has a genuine concern about poverty in developing countries and about ways of encouraging economic development in developing countries and that is very valuable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome this debate, too, because it arises from a recommendation made by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in a report on overseas aid about six years ago. In that report we proposed not only that this statement be made to parliament every year but that it be debated in parliament. Even though the debate is overdue, it is better that it happen now than not at all. I also welcome the content of the statement itself. I think it is a very valuable statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to speak in two parts: firstly, about the statement itself fairly briefly; and secondly, about the overall context of financial flows to developing countries in trying to broaden out that concept a bit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing to be said about this statement is that it demonstrates how extraordinarily disappointing Australia's aid performance is. That is not to say that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) have not struggled valiantly to increase our aid flows and that their achievement has not been significant. The fact is that, in each of the last two years, Australia's aid budget has increased by about $80 million, and that is a not inconsiderable amount. But it does remain true that our total aid contribution is now 0.33 per cent of our GDP, that the global target for aid is 0.7 per cent and that the average contribution of aid from donor countries&mdash;from the 20 donor countries&mdash;is in fact 0.46 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This figure is constantly distorted. What happens is that what is presented is a weighted average which weights aid from the United States in relation to its GDP, and Japan in relation to its GDP. It is not a simple arithmetic average. So we get the figure quoted that the weighted average is 0.3, which is true, but that is not a realistic figure. The realistic figure&mdash;the proper, accurate figure&mdash;is 0.46 per cent and, at 0.33 per cent, Australia is far below that. That means that two-thirds of other countries are providing more aid than Australia as a proportion of their GDP. Some, of course, like Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands&mdash;France even&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Finland, thank you. Actually, Finland is 0.45, so it is about on the average, but the other three Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands and, in fact, most of the social democratic countries of Europe are providing considerably more than that average. Even Canada, until this year, has been providing about that average 0.45 per cent. So we are constantly given a distorted view. This is not entirely the fault of our own Treasury and the other economic fundamentalists. It is the convention within the DAC, the Development Assistance Committee, of the OECD.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It obviously suits the countries that give less, particularly the United States, whose performance is absolutely abominable&mdash;down to 0.15 per cent in the most recent figures I have seen. It is disgraceful. A high proportion of funds go to Egypt and Israel. Egypt, of course, does need the funds, but it is a very distorted and politically biased aid program. The performance of the United States is shocking. Japan's has been improving, actually, and is quite useful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our performance is something we should be ashamed of. That is not to say, by the way, that the opposition, I fear, would do any better. At the last election the opposition was saying that it would cut the aid budget by $200 million, which was an appalling proposal. This is not at all a partisan point I am making. I am making a point about the level of Australian generosity towards people living in absolute poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must remember that a quarter of the global population&mdash;1.3 billion people&mdash;are living in absolute poverty. That means that at the end of every day they are still hungry, they do not have an adequate place to live, they are inadequately clothed, their lives are disrupted, dislocated, cramped and confined, and their personal potential is not fulfilled because they lack the basic requirements for a good life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We sometimes blame 19th century Britain for the inequities that Dickens demonstrated so vividly in his novels, but we have those inequities writ even larger on our television screens, and yet we do not adequately respond. That is not to say that some people do not respond generously&mdash;they do, as the honourable member for Aston said. There is a tradition amongst millions of Australians of contributing generously to voluntary aid programs. Well over $100 million is contributed annually to those programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting features of the statement that we are debating is the report on a survey of public attitudes to development assistance. It reports that the majority of respondents thought the level of Australia's overseas aid should be either increased or maintained at current levels. That is an encouraging reflection of community attitudes. However, I emphasise that our own performance is something about which we should be ashamed and that we are not, in any sense, responding to the intensity of the need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having made that point as strongly as I can, I now go on to the orientation of this statement. I think the orientation is excellent. It is a very valuable statement. It demonstrates a thoughtful approach to the uses of our aid and to the regional destinations of our aid. It talks particularly, for example, about the South Pacific region and Papua New Guinea, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, where there is great poverty, and about Africa, which is the greatest centre of poverty in the world. Then it talks about the particular areas to which aid will be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also has a very good section on social development. I particularly draw attention in that to the way in which the present minister has upgraded the population program. Probably the most cost effective form of aid is support for population programs. If the rate of population growth is even marginally reduced, then the possibility of increasing per capita incomes, of investing more productively, of increasing productivity in agriculture and industry, is significantly increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A real inadequacy in our aid program for a long time was that we gave so little to population programs. The present minister and the previous minister have redressed that, and there is now a whole series of very valuable programs that we are supporting in countries that want them&mdash;Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, China and countries in the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that this development of the aid program is one that deserves the wholehearted support of all Australians. There has been some controversy about the nature of one or two of those programs and it is very important, of course, that population programs be voluntary, that they be educative and that they aim to provide family planning information and capacity to people who want it, but that people not be forced to accept it. That is very important, obviously. But, given that proviso, this is one of the most cost effective forms of aid that we can offer and it is very valuable that it is being increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also good sections on health and education, both of which are profoundly important in development programs. In fact, to oversimplify only a little, one could say that investment in education is perhaps the best indicator of determination to achieve greater economic and social development, because it increases people's skills, it increases their capacity to help themselves and it is the basis for many other forms of change that are essential if economic development is going to be strongly sustained. It is very good that we are building up our commitment there. I think this section was in the report because it was prepared just before the world summit for social development. That summit was concentrating on ways of reducing poverty, unemployment and social disintegration. Australia made a very valuable contribution to the preparation for the summit and this report was part of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to move on now to briefly talk about the wider issue of the total resource flow to developing countries. There has been a tendency to be rather traditional in our approach to development and to see development assistance simply in terms of aid, but of course what matters to developing countries is the total level of resources they receive, from all sources. That includes not only concessional financing but also private investment, trade credits and lending to governments. All of those forms of resource flows are of value to developing countries in the development process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is quite a good table in the budget paper on overseas aid programs which draws together all the resource flows to developing countries. It shows that in total resources flows in the 1990s have been rising, particularly because there has been an increase in private investment. However, total resource flows are still well below what they were the beginning of the 1980s. It is that figure which perhaps most clearly demonstrates the problems that many developing countries have in achieving the resources they need in order to expand their investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important that we not only look at total resource flows as the best indicator of international development cooperation but see what has been happening to those total resource flows. When we do that, we find not only that they have been rising recently and that they are lower than they were 15 years ago, but also that they are concentrated in a few developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another source of worry. The principal recipients of total flows are China, Mexico, Argentina, Thailand and the Republic of Korea. In fact, in 1993 and 1994 China received most of the net increase in resource flows. China is a quarter of humankind, so that is not entirely surprising, but it has been very fashionable for private investment to flow to China in the last few years. That is important but it demonstrates gaping holes in total resource flows to countries which need it most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there has been some response to that situation of concessional public sector aid flows and now an increasing share of total resource flows is going to the sub-Sahara in Africa and other really impoverished countries. The response of the aid agencies in many countries has been to increase the flows to the poor countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is getting worse. As people know, I chair a committee here that is looking into Africa and I spoke with the equivalent committee in the United States. First of all, they said they had great difficulty getting anyone to serve on that committee; and, secondly, they said to me&mdash;and they made no apology for it and said it most unashamedly&mdash;`There are no votes for us in Africa, there are no votes for us in aid, and what we are trying to do is deal purely with the local issues.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I raised the question of the position of the United States in the world, they did not laugh at me, but they looked at me if I was a very naive person from some other part of the world. They were making the point that, in Congress, they have elections every two years and they are not going to worry too much about what is happening in Africa and other parts of the world. They were going to very much worry about what was happening in their own particular bailiwick. I left that meeting, and Washington, very disappointed. There has always been a tendency in the United States to become isolationist, but that tendency is very strong today and it is a bit frightening. It is disappointing that they do not see that they have a very important role in the whole question of aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took note of what the member for Fraser said in the criticisms he offered, but I also agree with him that the paper we are debating is a very welcome and well-focused paper. We cannot correct all the wrongs of the world and there is never enough money to do everything we would like to do. But it is important that our aid is focused: we must not have a broad-brush approach but a very focused approach to our whole aid question. I naturally also very much support the comments he made on the population issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like all members of parliament I am often challenged on the aid question. One group in the community argues that Australia does not give enough overseas aid and claims that what it does give is poorly channelled. Another group points out the real or imagined economic problems we have in this country and suggests that, really, charity begins at home. Some would say that there should be no government aid at all and that all aid should be raised through the private sector. I suppose that, as in all things, government action is a matter of competing interests, but I believe that this government has made a significant contribution to poverty alleviation through the Australian aid program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, those who argue that Australia should give no overseas aid overlook the fact that much of this money is spent in Australia, or by employing Australians on overseas aid projects. I know the linking of aid to trade is a contentious issue. Nevertheless, it is an issue of considerable economic significance to many Australians. In this parliament last week there was a seminar organised by Community Aid Abroad and World Vision. This whole question of tying trade to aid was raised there and I thought it was dealt with in a very sensible and understanding way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), in his contribution, said that the question of aid is not as easy as it seems; and that is true. But I must say that I have visited many Australian overseas aid projects and I have always found them to be well run and of great benefit where they are. I guess, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when the question of aid is raised with you by your constituents&mdash;as it is with me&mdash;the Mekong Friendship Bridge is always mentioned. I actually doubt that any other issue has generated as much misinformation as the Mekong Friendship Bridge has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, as part of a parliamentary delegation, I was privileged to cross this bridge, which is one of the most visible examples of the effectiveness of Australia's development assistance. It is the first road link between Laos and Thailand, and will yield significant economic benefits to both countries. Indeed, if anyone needed proof of this, they need only look at the entrepreneurial activities which have already commenced on the Thai side. On the Laos side, there will actually have to be something done about the road. It is not particularly the best road&mdash;it is not the federal highway that we are used to&mdash;when you try and travel from the bridge into the capital. Nevertheless, it has been of tremendous importance to those two countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As important as the bridge is for the economies of Laos and Thailand, it is one of the highest profile aid projects undertaken by Australia in recent years&mdash;and, incidentally, it was completed under time and under budget. The bridge is a showcase of what Australian excellence in technology design and infrastructure transfer can achieve, and of what Australia can deliver; as such, it is very important in our expanding trade relationship with Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Population issues have continued to be an important aspect of Australia's overseas aid program. As one who is convinced that overpopulation and economic underdevelopment are closely linked, I welcome the emphasis in our aid program on population issues. The priority which the aid program affords population issues was reflected in the major role that Australia played at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in December of last year. Australia was active in encouraging the international conference to adopt the groundbreaking program of action for the empowerment of women, and called for major increases in global resources for family planning and health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to refer to the significant developments in the nature of our assistance to the health sector. Funding for health was given a major boost in the 1994-95 aid budget, with the introduction of a four-year initiative targeting four priority areas: malaria, polio, tetanus and HIV/AIDS. The innovation involves additional funding of $110 million over four years, nearly doubling Australia's current spending on health under the aid program. As with assistance for population activities, AusAID has developed a set of principles which will guide this new funding. These principles state that improvements in health are best achieved through an integrated approach which tackles the causes of poverty and improves the status and wellbeing of vulnerable groups, particularly women and children. Changes are also under way in Australia's program of assistance to education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has recently refined its aid program to Africa, under a statement entitled `New framework for Australia's aid to Africa', made on 16 August&mdash;only last week&mdash;by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney). It is important. Australia still makes a significant contribution of aid to Africa&mdash;something like a $190 million&mdash;but that aid is going to be very much targeted to Zimbabwe, South Africa and Mozambique, and I have a few worries about the targeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I welcome the specific targeting of aid, one worry I have is that, with South Africa being flavour of the month, as it were, at the moment, all of the money not only from Australia but from many other parts of the world&mdash;be it from the European Community or other areas&mdash;is going to flow into South Africa. That is good for South Africa and I think it is good that we are making a contribution. We are not the largest aid giver to South Africa but the money that we are giving should, I believe, be targeted to short training courses which bring people to Australia for, say, nursing or teacher training. We do not want to be funding any more PhDs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My worry about South Africa is that all the countries are putting money into South Africa&mdash;and that is fine&mdash;but, unless the countries surrounding South Africa can deal with their problems, whatever we do in South Africa is going to come to nought. For example, unless the economies of Mozambique and Angola come right, refugees will cross the border in their millions. As poor as parts of South Africa are at the moment, it is still much better off than the surrounding countries. Already there are a couple of million people crossing the border each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the aid that people are giving is all going to South Africa&mdash;and, for sure, South Africa has the economic structure and is the economic power of that region&mdash;that country will be a magnet for those poor people all around it. Unless we can get their economies right and persuade them not to seek the higher economic advantage of going to South Africa, all the work we are doing in South Africa will not be for nought but will become much more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should look a bit broader. We cannot tackle all the problems of Africa, of course we cannot. Instead of just focusing on Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa&mdash;and it is important that we focus on these three countries&mdash;perhaps we could spread the net a little wider and help, say, the 11 SADC countries to get their economies right. If we provided some economic aid for those countries, perhaps many of the problems coming up in South Africa will not need to be addressed. One of the real issues for South Africa is people crossing the borders all the time from surrounding countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to commend the government for the courage it has taken over the last few years in increasing the funding on the population issue. I know it has not been easy and I know there has been criticism raised about it. I know also that there has been a lot of nonsense spoken about it and that a lot of misinformation has been peddled out in the community. Those who argue against funding for population issues have to justify why they are arguing to keep women and children in a situation of absolute poverty and in life threatening conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is a link between underdevelopment and overpopulation. Anyone who has been to any of those countries would have seen the sorts of conditions that people are subjected to in the way they have to live. I think every child born should be a wanted child and that every child born should have the opportunity to reach its full potential, whatever that potential may be. While we continue, for religious, moral or social grounds, to deny these people this attitude, we are subjecting people to a life that we would not particularly want to live. </PARA>

We have sought to secure a balance between a number of the elements which could be expected to influence our attitude. First of all there is our humanitarian concern, particularly in the context of the admirable comment which was made by my colleague, the member for Fraser. The Australian aid program is also recognition of the fact that Australia&mdash;particularly in terms of our resource endowment, our level of development, our institutional stability and our per capita income&mdash;is one of the most privileged countries in the world. The program reflects Australia's growing recognition of the fact that the world must be seen as a global community. Some people refer to the world as the global village within which&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly! A very apt term and one which has been widely adopted because it is so apt. Within that global community and within that global village, all countries have a responsibility to others. There is also the matter of Australia's acceptance of our special responsibility towards Papua New Guinea, the South Pacific, South-East Asia and, increasingly, the countries in the Indian Ocean area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer particularly to the question of the nature of the global village because I am reminded that my maternal great-grandparents and my paternal great-great-grandparents came out from England, Wales and Ireland in the middle of the last century. The fastest time in which my ancestors could get to Australia was three months. I can now get to England, Wales or Ireland in 24 hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, as a result of that technological development, the speed of travel, the bringing together of communities around the world, we have physically contracted the globe from the size that it was in the middle of the last century to something which is now one-ninetieth the size, because what took us 90 days before now takes us one day. So those people who, at one time, we thought were around the other side of the world are not. They are next door; they are 24 hours away. Within that distance of 24 hours travel, there is abject massive poverty. And they are neighbours; they are like the people next door. We would not tolerate starvation of Australians in Victoria, Western Australia or the Northern Territory. We are prepared to tolerate it elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My friend and colleague John Langmore said that we should be ashamed of our effort. What we are providing this year is 0.33 per cent of GDP. The UN target is 0.7 per cent. We are about 13th among 24 countries of the OECD in terms of the contribution that we make to international aid. Last year our increase was 3.6 per cent, which was less than our GDP. John Langmore said that we should be ashamed. I think so too. He also made the point that one-quarter of the world's people live in abject poverty&mdash;that is 1.3 billion people. Those 1.3 billion people are not just under difficult circumstances; they are in abject poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once before, I made an observation, and let me repeat it so that we put this into context. I made the observation that every three to four seconds one child dies as a result of preventable malnutrition and disease. That is 1,200 every hour; that is 30,000 kids every day; that is 11 million kids every year. Preventable diseases and preventable malnutrition! Let me put that into some further context. Every year the world spends money on what we like to call military expenditure. You can call it whatever you like. You can call it defence. In some cases, quite clearly, it is preparation for war, though not on our part. Unfortunately, there are still aggressive nations in the world, as we know, so that is part of it as well. Every year the world spends on military expenditure one million million dollars&mdash;$1 trillion. What a reflection that is on the morality of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Copenhagen earlier this year, at the World Summit for Social Development, a paper was issued&mdash;John Langmore provided me with my copy&mdash;which drew attention to that fact. It also drew attention to the fact that, by taking one-quarter of that $1 trillion&mdash;by taking $250 billion or $250,000 million&mdash;out of that total military preparation budget, the world could eliminate those critical problems which cause massive suffering and all of those deaths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the world could eliminate starvation and malnourishment with $19 billion; health care could be covered with $15 billion; shelter, for the people who do not have shelter, could be provided with $21 billion; safe, clean water&mdash;something that we take for granted&mdash;could be provided with $50 billion. We could retire the Third World debt with $30 billion. We could prevent soil erosion with $24 billion. With $10 billion, we could stabilise population, a matter that was referred to quite correctly&mdash;let us make no mistake&mdash;by my colleague Colin Hollis. We could have clean, safe, efficient and renewable energy with $50 billion. With one-quarter of the total military budget we could overcome those problems of the world&mdash;and we do not do it!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when John Langmore correctly says, `We should be ashamed,' I say, `Yes, we should&mdash;every one of us.' I repeat: every one of us. Let no-one try to excuse himself or herself from the fact that they are single members of the world community which allows that situation to prevail. Let no-one claim innocence. I said that with $250 billion we could overcome those problems. That is only about half of Australia's gross domestic product each year, and we are just a little country in the world. Half of our GDP each year would overcome all of those problems throughout the world&mdash;and the world fails to act adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New directions in Australia's overseas aid program</EMPHASIS>, is the fifth annual report. Last year's report concentrated particularly on Australia's approach to reducing poverty. This year's report builds on that and deals in particular with our approach to social development and humanitarian relief, and of course the details are adequately canvassed in the report. I applaud, endorse and support the attempts that people make, including, let me say, those of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), in whose name the report was issued. Gordon Bilney has a proud background and record in connection with questions of this kind. He is a well-chosen minister in that portfolio and I know that he, as well as so many of my colleagues, is doing what he can in connection with this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are certain historic reasons as well, I should say, why Australia should pay so much attention to Papua New Guinea. I think about 22 per cent of our total aid program goes to Papua New Guinea. The responsibility of assisting there means that the program is then reduced for other countries in the world that we may be able to assist, but we do have those historical responsibilities and that is quite appropriate. I would like to see the aid program increased. It did increase in real terms by, I think, 3.6 per cent last year. We were one of the very few countries that increased our aid program last year in real terms, so some effort is being made. But, while ever the reality of those circumstances that I just described prevails, we are not moving fast enough, we are not doing enough, and it reflects on every single one of us. </PARA>

I would also like to take the opportunity of making a few remarks on the broader question of Australia's aid budget and the direction of our policy with respect to overseas aid. I do have a number of observations that I would like to make in that regard and, from memory, this is the first opportunity that I have had in the parliament to make some comments on the question of our aid program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will start by pointing out that, certainly in my electorate, overseas aid is a fairly major issue. My electorate is not necessarily a typical electorate in many respects, but I do believe that this issue is an important one right across the community. In my electorate I am contacted, virtually on a weekly basis, by constituents, church groups, and local aid organisations about a whole variety of issues associated with Australia's aid program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that there are a lot of Australians who are active in aid groups, people who donate to the many worthwhile projects that the aid groups participate in, and people who are very concerned about Australia's overseas aid program. Those people have some strong views about how we should be pursuing our assistance to countries&mdash;particularly in our region, but also generally. Often politicians tend to understate the importance of aid. Like rabbits out of a hat, they pull out statements like `charity begins at home', without realising that for a lot of people this issue is important, even in a fairly narrow sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn quickly to the aid budget for this year, which has been mentioned by previous speakers. I think it is worth placing on the record my views about this budget. This year's aid budget was increased by $83 million. In real terms, the increase was effectively worth about $28 million, so the total budget is now up to $1,563 million or thereabouts. In context, that was a reasonably good result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I have been here, I have been part of the debates in the pre-budget period about the aid budget, trying to make sure that it is increased&mdash;and also at the ALP national conference last year, where similar issues were dealt with. As has been noted by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), one of the unfortunate aspects of this year's aid budget is that it has again reduced our total aid contribution&mdash;not to a historically low level, but certainly to one of the lowest levels for some considerable period of time&mdash;down to 0.33 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that this decrease will make it fairly difficult for us to achieve our official policy target of 0.4 per cent by the year 2000 and 0.5 per cent by 2005. On the face of it, this is a grim statistic and something that we ought to be taking some stock of. It is true to say that Australia is above average relative to the OECD with respect to aid&mdash;although, as the honourable member for Fraser indicated in his contribution, there are some doubts about the methodology of assessing that average&mdash;but I do not think in an area like this we are entitled to consider that that performance is good enough. So, in my view, it is fundamentally important that we improve our performance in terms of our overseas aid contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth while pointing out though, as something of an alibi, that it is slightly artificial to be critical of the government for failing to increase the overseas aid budget sufficiently in a time when growth rates are running at a very high level. The countervailing proposition is that when we are in recession it is okay to reduce the overseas aid budget, or not to worry about trying to increase it, because the base against which you are measuring it is not growing, or in fact may well be contracting. So an alibi, with respect to criticisms of the government, is that one of the reasons why we have seen a drop is that the gross domestic product has been growing over the last year or two at a very high rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to a couple of specific aspects of the aid budget, I was pleased to see that aid to Africa has been increased by 21 per cent, up to over $122 million. This is an area that we have historically neglected. It is also good to see that aid to south Asia has been increased to $74 million, although it is a bit distressing to see that both of these increases are substantially explained in terms of, in a sense, catching up on last year's promised increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth pointing out that some of the increases can be explained by program increases that are, in my view, of limited value. For example, assistance to the coal industry in India, which is designed to increase the efficiency of the coal industry there, is unlikely to have any great benefits for the vast bulk of the poorer people in India. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is worth noting that there are quite a number of important new initiatives or improved initiatives in the aid budget. There is an extra $25 million to cover basic technical and further education programs in Bangladesh, Mongolia, Gaza, the Philippines, South Africa and the Pacific. It is also worth noting the funding to the International Crisis Group and the Institute of Democracy and Electoral Assistance. There has been a doubling in funding for the Women in Development Fund. The increases to expenditure on women's education and child labour issues are also worthy of note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are one or two disturbing aspects. For example, $6.8 million is to go to the Korean Energy Development Organisation, which is part of the process of supposedly defusing nuclear tension on the Korean Peninsula. In reality, it involves us in developing the nuclear industry in Korea and that is something that I have some trouble with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to see that the DIFF program has been reduced by $10 million, from $130 million to $120 million. That is because that is essentially driven by commercial objectives rather than by aid objectives. The fact that virtually everybody else does it is not a sufficient argument to justify Australia saying that our aid program is basically a self-interest exercise designed to deliver commercial benefits to Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth remembering that the Jackson committee report in 1994 recommended that our aid strategy should be based on poverty alleviation and humanitarian objectives as the primary focus, and that diplomatic and commercial objectives should be subsidiary to that. It is certainly questionable as to whether we have achieved that objective. It is concerning that, particularly in that light, AusAID still seems to harbour economic growth as the primary factor in poverty alleviation, hence the assistance to the Indian coal industry. It states in AusAID's poverty policy that `sustainable economic growth is an essential pre-requisite for poverty reduction'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a sense in which equity issues and distribution issues are seen as, in some way, being secondary. Not far below the surface we have the infamous trickle-down analysis, and the notion that if the economic circumstances of the wealthier elites of a country are improved that will inevitably drag everybody else in the country up with them. In fact, the evidence and experience suggests that the reverse occurs&mdash;that there is growing inequality, that there is growing disruption in communities, and that there are serious adverse impacts from major projects and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not being strongly critical of AusAID in this regard, because I believe that this situation is changing. It is changing in the wake of changes with international institutions such as the World Bank. The 1990 World Development Report of the World Bank states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rapid and politically sustainable progress on poverty has been achieved by pursuing a strategy that has two equally important elements. The first element is to promote the productive use of the poor's most abundant asset, labour. It calls for policies that harness marketing incentives, social and political institutions, infrastructure and technology to that end. The second is to provide basic social services to the poor. Primary health care, family planning, nutrition and primary education are especially important.</PARA>
<PARA>In my view that is something approximating a reasonable balance in an aid philosophy&mdash;namely, that equity issues are at least as important as growth issues. It seems to me that, at least until recently, we have been somewhat lagging behind on that particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 the World Bank said that government intervention appeared in some instances to have resulted in higher and more equal growth than otherwise would have occurred. It is also particularly clear that strategies of aid based on market liberalisation tend to have serious adverse consequences&mdash;for example, particularly adverse consequences on women in rural and tribal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent study for the Asian Development Bank entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rural poverty in Asia</EMPHASIS> confirmed those conclusions. There are signs that our policy is shifting to a greater emphasis on human capital, on assisting people with things like family planning, basic health care and education as a greater priority. For example, it is very pleasing to see that in recent times the proportion of our education aid budget that goes to tertiary education has significantly declined and there is an increasing shift in emphasis towards primary and basic education and technical education, which is obviously where it ought to be. I would think that, although there is some value in providing assistance through the mechanisms of tertiary education, that is predominantly going to assist entrenched elites in the countries where the assistance is provided and the direct impact on people in poverty in those countries will be very, very limited. However, the impact of broadening the provision of basic education in those countries can be of considerable value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think that in some respects, to be fair to the minister and to AusAID, the emphasis is changing for the better. Certainly the statement that we are giving consideration to today is a good indication that that shift is under way. I would like to see it go further, to ensure that the emphasis is very strongly on the question of poverty alleviation and social justice and that questions of equality, equity and access to basic health and education services have primacy in our strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next comment I would like to make is on a matter that was addressed by my colleague the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) which I have very strong views on, as he does. That is the question of population control and family planning programs. In the 1993-94 budget we went through a bit of a fiasco where, to satisfy the rather peculiar views of one independent senator, we had to put on hold a very substantial increase in the population and development programs in the aid budget. Thankfully, the study that was undertaken as part of that agreement did confirm the clear connections between population growth rates and levels of underdevelopment, poverty and the like. It is good to see this in the minister's statement to the House in March this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access to safe and effective family planning services is a fundamental right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is long overdue that religious fundamentalism is removed from these debates and that Australia pursues strategies with respect to family planning assistance to poorer countries that are based on the practical realities of life and not on religious zealotry. I certainly would share the views of the honourable member for Throsby that any attempt to disrupt our aid program or to disrupt population strategies and assistance in that regard should be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final comment I would make in the one minute that remains to me is to endorse the remark made by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) towards the end of his contribution that these issues are, as a result of internationalisation, rapidly going to become domestic issues. The notion that charity begins at home is, in my view, valid in the sense that the earth is our home, and so I see Australians and Australia as having just as much interest, both in a practical and a theoretical sense, in the lives, futures and circumstances of people overseas, particularly in our region, as they do in problems that we face here in this country. We will have to confront these issues more and more as practical problems that we have to deal with domestically. Because of internationalisation, they are not things over there; they are things that are going to confront us here and now as issues that do affect us, and that is something that will, hopefully, inform increases in our aid program in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important from the outset that we acknowledge the contribution of many eminent people in the production and development of the Justice Statement. The ability to access justice is an issue that goes out to touch many people in our community, and that is particularly so for women, whom I represent in my portfolio responsibilities as shadow minister for the status of women. The Justice Statement is, undoubtedly, the result of the dedication and effort of some very highly qualified people, and that is certainly evident, as you read through this report, in the quality of the recommendations presented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A feature of this government has been its eagerness to undertake and commission studies, reviews, committees and so forth. In fact, one cannot fault the data collection process, and it has usually been done by the best available people. But the government's commitment to implementing and progressing the recommendations made so often falls on infertile ground. It certainly does not match the commitment of the review process, and that has to be of concern to everyone, as well. The government continually stalls in its implementation of inquiry recommendations. We see this across many portfolios, and it is very evident in my other shadow portfolio of small business, with too many reports being left to gather dust on ministers' desks or on the many bookshelves in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Justice Statement is yet another example of the government's regurgitation of existing policies. They have a wonderful statement here but, in terms of translating this Justice Statement into actual policy, they are short on. What we have actually seen is a regurgitation, in some areas&mdash;not new initiatives, and not always the implementation of the recommendations that have been made. So, under the guise of a new cover, and with the pretence that the community will not notice such a sleight of hand, we get the outcome of that report, and it is not entirely in keeping with all of the commitment and recommendations that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Existing programs in some instances have been operating for a period of time already, before this report came out. Sometimes there is a bit of tinkering at the edges but no substantive move to change, but the programs have been conveniently repackaged to provide the perception that the government is initiating new policies. This is alluded to in the foreword of the Justice Statement, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government now responds to the challenge for change in our legal system with this Statement.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement has to be analysed, and I will comment on a number of aspects of the Justice Statement as they relate to women and small business. Perhaps I will take a look at two or three of the positives first. There has been, of course, some commitment to increasing the funding in order to fund some of the recommendations made by the task force. For example, provision will be made of $12.3 million over four years to establish a national network of women's legal centres, to provide advice and assistance to those women in city and country areas who have legal problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will provide an additional $5 million over four years to enable the network of women's legal centres to establish specialist services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, and those shifts are welcomed by the coalition. The government will commit an extra $500,000 to establish a national outreach and development fund to develop legal information resources on issues relevant to women, including family law matters, violence against women, discrimination, employment matters, `sexually transmitted debt'&mdash;I am not sure what that last one means&mdash;and other areas of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are some moves by the government to increase funding levels in relation to the delivery of justice. The government's commitment to justice for women, though, must be considered objectively against its other funding priorities. The Justice Statement is forecast to receive nearly $39 million in 1995-96. Of these funds, approximately $26.48 million has been allocated to issues closely associated with women and their families. So, out of that total funding, about $26 million will go specifically to women and to their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately $6.6 million has been specifically allocated to justice issues of immediate concern to women. On a per capita basis, this represents an outlay of $1 per woman aged 15 years and over in Australia. By contrast, the Australian Trade Union Training Authority will receive $8.7 million from the 1995-96 federal budget for its activities, a per capita rate of approximately $1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On balance, this reflects the government's priority to look after its mates ahead of the interests of women. One dollar a year is unlikely to provide any meaningful solution to the access and equity difficulties confronting many Australian women in their dealings with Australia's justice system. The services of a solicitor today could cost between $100 and $250 per hour while the cost of the services of a QC begins at a low of about $2,000 but can go very quickly upward depending on the complexity and the nature of the issue being addressed. There are many in the community who simply do not qualify for legal aid and who have no recourse to justice in this country. That is particularly so for many thousands of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further feature of the Justice Statement is the deceptive nature of many of the subprograms. Take, for example, the expenditure allocated to domestic violence. The budget reduced the community education violence against women program in Budget Paper No. 1 and announced the cessation of the program which was delivered by the Office of the Status of Women. The saving for the government is $1.15 million. This is particularly interesting in view of the fact that yesterday the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Dr Lawrence), in a big media scene, announced that the government had now completed, through the Office of the Status of Women, a research paper on community attitudes to violence against women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no criticism of this report at all and it reveals some very interesting points. For example, it reveals that community attitudes toward violence against women have shifted very dramatically. A large number of people believe now that violence against women in domestic situations is a crime and that violence is no longer an acceptable way for people to deal with disputes within the family home. But it is curious: the minister said that this education program to produce a shift in results is a very important part of the process of dealing with domestic violence; when a survey was done in 1975, the results clearly showed that most people thought that domestic violence and disputes in domestic situations were only the business of the people involved in the dispute. Most people thought that the police should not have any jurisdiction in such situations and that domestic violence should not be considered to be a crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, community views have changed and there is no doubt that part of the shift in attitude about this matter is because of the allocation of funds to the community education program through the Office of the Status of Women. What do we see? We see a program that is working and that is producing a result and yet the government has swiped the funding out from under its feet. The government is saying that it is not going to fund that program any more and that the program will cease to exist. I do not believe&mdash;despite the big shift in community attitudes&mdash;that we can afford to let go of this. We need to continue with a community education program to make sure that people understand that domestic violence is not an option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the last sitting, the minister declared that the government was going to spend another $1.1 million on yet another data collecting process on domestic violence. What we see here is a policy vacuum created by the government: an inability to translate its data collection process into policy and an inability to deliver outcomes to the electorate, in many cases. It is one thing to change community attitudes, but we have seen an increase in the incidence of violence against women in their own homes. Clearly, the next step for the government is to take measures to change the behaviour of people in our community in terms of their use of violence as an option to resolve disputes. We are not seeing that agenda moved forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not seeing that agenda move forward. It is one thing to change the attitudes and it is another to change the behaviour. What we are seeing, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, is an increase in the incidence of domestic violence in Australia today, and it is quite a substantial increase. The national crime statistics, for example, reveal that the number of sexual assaults for the 12 months ending December 1994 has increased by eight per cent or 515 additional assaults. In total, 13,277 individuals reported being sexually assaulted during this period. That is 37 sexual assaults per day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, it is going to take more than an education program to get these behaviour changes. It is going to take more than setting up centres for people to go to find out what their rights are and get some access to justice, and there will still be many women who simply will not have that option. If they do not qualify for legal aid they are unlikely to obtain justice in this area. What we have to do is start changing the behaviour. That is a critical part of the move to deal with this problem in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One must question the efficacy of disbanding a policy that was clearly delivering some outcomes. But this program will be replaced largely by a network of women's legal centres, including five centres to be newly established and others with their roles expanded. Some of those centres are already in operation in the capital cities. This was hailed as a new initiative but, in fact, it is an old one that is just being expanded. There is no criticism of the expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a gap in the provision of services to women. The Justice Statement states that, over the next few months, the government will consult with local communities to determine the best locations for the new services and the most appropriate options for delivering services to meet the needs of each region. In other words, services and support for women will decline while the government procrastinates, yet again, over the next move. After 13 years in government, with a high focus on this particular area, they still now have to proceed with a process that may take several months to complete before this process of expanding the legal centres happens. There is a gap here which would cause a great deal of concern and more delays in the provision of vital services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be reasonable to expect that the process of identifying the need for the initiatives outlined in the Justice Statement would also have been suitable for the development of models for the identification and establishment of delivery mechanisms to ensure immediate implementation of services to women. After all, many&mdash;if not all&mdash;of these issues have been the subject of numerous studies, reports, consultancies and commissions over the last 13 years. What we have in here is all the recommendations but no plan as to how to implement these recommendations. Now we will go through another gap period before the implementation of those recommendations that are going to be implemented occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I wind up, I would also like to touch briefly on small business. The small business sector does not gain much new benefit from the Justice Statement, as almost all of the initiatives outlined in the report are already established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commitment of an extra $1.7 million over four years to expand the corporate law simplification program is welcome, but is unlikely to generate the much needed focus required to accelerate the pace of the reform process. Small businesses are still being overwhelmed by the proliferation and complexity of corporations law, as well as taxation and trade practices law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, if one looks at a list of items that are constantly raised within the small business arena, one sees that issues such as legislation affecting competition, copyright law, parliamentary consultation, the drafting of legislation, the simplification of corporations law, the rewriting of the taxation act into plain English, the review of outdated legislation, business regulation, consumer protection, delegated legislation, trade practices and the Freedom of Information Act are just some of the many issues that are impacting severely on small business today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a slight sense of deja vu in making a contribution on this report today because it is only about nine or 10 months ago that I and colleagues such as the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) were here discussing the Sackville report&mdash;as it was colloquially titled&mdash;which was the progenitor of the government's Justice Statement. In fact, it was October of last year that we were debating the proposals in the Sackville report in the Main Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to recap on the propositions that the Sackville report put, they included the proposal that the proceedings of certain courts be open to the electronic media, and television in particular&mdash;a proposition which I and the member for Banks are very strongly opposed to, and I reiterate my opposition to that proposition. The Sackville report proposals also included: the development of a single national market for legal services; the establishment of mechanisms to ensure that clients are provided with far greater information by lawyers about their circumstances, the proceedings that they may be involved in and the services that are to be provided for them; a proposal that lawyers be required to provide written quotes to clients, roughly in the same way that tradespeople usually do; and proposals to provide for limited options with respect to contingency fees, with which I have some reservations but which, as they were developed, seem to me to be fairly cautious and reasonable. There were also proposals for independent complaints bodies to scrutinise lawyers and the delivery of legal services&mdash;a proposition which I am extremely strongly attracted to&mdash;and strategies to eliminate some of the many procedural delays and tangles that tend to cause enormous problems in our court system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of these proposals, of course, related to state jurisdiction matters and I am pleased to say that some of them, in various forms, are being pursued by some of the states. I do not necessarily agree with everything that the Victorian Attorney-General, Jan Wade, has done in her time in that office. In fact, there is an awful lot that I disagree with, but I do at least acknowledge her courage and willingness to tackle issues of legal reform along these lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is a long way to go on many of these issues. I was present, along with other members of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, at a discussion with the Law Council of Australia some weeks ago and it was very interesting to discuss some of these issues with the council. One of the points that I raised with them was: how serious was their commitment to the notion of a national uniform market for legal services when they continue to defend the existence of separate professions in states like Victoria? The result is that we have a situation where what a lawyer can and cannot do in South Australia, for example, is different from what a lawyer can and cannot do in Victoria. A barrister in Victoria is unable to perform services that fall within the traditional scope of a solicitor, whereas in South Australia you have a merged profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem to me that, if you are going to have a uniform national market for legal services, one of the most obvious components of uniformity is that the various players in that market can do the same things, and deliver the same services, irrespective of what state of the Commonwealth they happen to be in. I was disappointed to see that the Law Council did not seem to see any contradiction in those two positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, I do feel that the winds of change are blowing fairly strongly through the legal profession and it is pleasing to see that there is impetus for this coming from both sides of politics. Although there is considerable work to be done, I have no doubt that, over the next 10 years or so, major change is going to occur which will be of benefit to the community, both to lower income earners, who in many respects are excluded from legal services, and also to the community generally in the sense of improving economic efficiency and reducing costs that legal services do constitute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having made those background remarks I now turn to the content of the government's Justice Statement. It is based on three key themes&mdash;prevention, reform, and equality and social justice. I would like to run through some of the basics of the statement, as the first government speaker. Firstly, concerning family mediation strategies, $18.7 million over four years is allocated to a variety of initiatives associated with marriage and relationship courses, family skills training, the development of eight new adolescent mediation and family therapy services, and up to 20 new financial counselling services. And an amount of $13.5 million over four years is allocated for the Family Court to increase counselling services and registries in provincial and rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in the area of criminal law, in a safer Australia strategy, $7.3 million is to be spent over four years. That entails a variety of prevention oriented measures, further work on the development of a model criminal code, the establishment of a national missing persons bureau, and, perhaps most importantly, work on pursuing tighter gun controls. It is not an issue that tends to get debated a great deal in the federal parliament but, for the record, my view is that tighter gun controls are essential. I would support very strongly further restricting access to guns in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third category of initiatives is associated with the general delivery of legal services. We will see the establishment of an Australian legal assistance board which is intended to coordinate and plan the delivery of legal aid assistance across the country. There is to be $24 million spent over four years for more legal assistance, particularly focusing on family and civil law cases. An amount of $30 million over four years has been allocated for the doubling of the community legal centres' budget and that involves the establishment of nine new community legal centres across the country, something that I will say more about in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amount of $10 million has been allocated to a national disbursements assistance fund which, in effect, will enable the funding up-front of public interest cases. For example, environmental cases and the like which otherwise would not have been able to be funded will now be funded. There is to be a women's justice strategy, which the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) has applauded. I note her support for that and I will say more about her comments in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be $17 million spent over four years on specialist women's legal centres in each capital city. There is to be a toll-free phone service. There will be specialist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander services within the framework of those women's legal centres. And, as the honourable member for Pearce outlined, there will be an outreach service for women consumers of legal services in remote and rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have the strategy to reform procedures and the profession, which, of course, largely depends on cooperation with the states and negotiations with the states about change. As part of that, there is to be an overhaul of the Federal Court fee scales and the initiation of a Prices Surveillance Authority study of lawyers' fees, both of which are welcome initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A strategy will also be developed to assist courts and tribunals to develop charters of access to their services and to simplify their rules and procedures. We will develop strategies to tackle the backlog of cases which so many courts in Australia are bedevilled by. There is also a strategy to develop judicial education, professional development training, with respect to things such as cross-cultural awareness and gender issues awareness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are specific initiatives with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders such as funding for interpreter training and Family Court outreach services and similar initiatives with respect to people of non-English speaking background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In overall terms, I applaud the Justice Statement. I have had a fair degree of involvement in the past with community legal centres. The increased provision of services through community legal centres is a major initiative. There are many people in our community for whom the only serious prospect of access to legal services is via local community legal centres. There are many parts of the country&mdash;not those I represent, I hasten to add&mdash;where people have no real access to community legal services. If they lack the income and the wealth to be able to get ordinary legal services, then those people are left high and dry. For many common or garden, mundane legal problems, be they criminal problems in the Magistrate's Court&mdash;perhaps somebody has pranged their car and they cannot get the other person to pay up because they are uninsured&mdash;civil problems or disputes and the like, in a very high proportion of these cases people are unable to get justice. The barrier that prevents them getting justice is the high cost of participating in our legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud women's legal centres because it is very obvious that there are many legal issues which are focused on gender questions. I can only cite my own experience as a trade union official dealing with sexual harassment matters where the general preference for female victims of sexual harassment, very understandably, was to be represented by a female union official. It seems perfectly reasonable to me to have gender specific areas in legal services because there will be many areas where it will be of much greater benefit and assistance to women consumers to be able to deal with things on a gender specific basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also applaud the assistance to environmental and other cases&mdash;which I expect will be offered through the national disbursements assistance fund&mdash;and prevention strategies with respect to crime and family problems. It is not only in the health area that prevention tends to be a very poor relation. In legal and criminal areas, prevention also tends to be neglected. It is long overdue that we pursue a more prevention oriented strategy. This is a very worthwhile initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already made some comments on procedure reform and the reform of the profession and I applaud anything that is done in that regard. I am sure anybody who has experienced some of the Byzantine procedural arrangements in areas like the Victorian Supreme Court and elsewhere would applaud the initiatives designed to improve those things and to make them more accessible and less expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, before I turn to comments made by the honourable member for Pearce, it is worth noting that what this Justice Statement ultimately shows is that, even in a budget that was necessarily contractionary, this Labor government is still able to deliver on important social justice initiatives. After 12 years in office, it is still reforming and pursuing basic Labor programs that help people who are on lower incomes and suffer as a result of having less wealth than many others in society. Access to legal services and justice is a critical component of being able to participate fully in our society. It is great that, at this advanced stage of being in government, we are still pursuing initiatives like this. There is a lot more to be done. I am sure the government will continue to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I turn to some of the comments of the honourable member for Pearce. I am almost tempted to offer her membership of the Left of the Labor Party for some of the things that she said. It was very good to hear her criticising the government for reducing funding on domestic violence education and saying how we have not given enough money to the women's initiatives in the Justice Statement. What I would point out is that the person speaking was somebody who was elected to parliament, along with my honourable colleagues opposite, on a platform which centred on reducing federal government expenditure by $10 billion per annum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The social justice statement certainly covered a wide range of subjects, and I want to deal in the main with chapter 8, which deals with consumer protection issues, but I naturally must comment on some of the empty gongs and clashing cymbals that were so evident in the contribution of the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). Indeed, Labor has been very good about the rhetoric of social justice, but its actual achievements have, of course, been abysmal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) looked decidedly uncomfortable in delivering a justice and equity statement, because those are areas where he has never taken any significant interest and where his own performance and results have been utterly abysmal. Whilst somebody no doubt wrote the right words for him, he clearly did not have his heart in them, because his objectives have always been elsewhere. Indeed, after more than a decade of Labor rule, we clearly now have a much more unequal society than we had when Labor came to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is their record of social justice and social equity, then there is indeed a need for a major turnaround, for a new direction, and so a policy statement on these sorts of issues was long overdue. Unfortunately, the statement is, however, long on rhetoric. It contains many words which are obviously supportable&mdash;motherhood statements of support for all the good things of life&mdash;but, in reality, very few initiatives which are likely to achieve much to benefit the Australian people through better access to justice or greater equity in policy delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am especially concerned that many of the matters that are referred to require legislative action; yet, as I look through the legislative program, the reforms to the Trade Practices Act which are central to the consumer protection elements of this statement are not on the program for the rest of this year. That gives you some idea about the level of government commitment. We had a grand statement and plenty of rhetoric last May, but none of the legislation dealing with these matters is going to see the light of day in this parliament&mdash;because we all know that this is virtually certain to be its last session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is saying, `Here is a long list of Labor objectives, none of which will be achieved by the election; but you have got to believe in us as you believed in the tax cuts and all of the election promises last time, if you want to see any of them delivered.' I think the public have a right to be a bit sceptical about how many of the promises and how much of what is included in the rhetoric of the Justice Statement will actually be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a number of initiatives, spoken of in relation to consumer matters, which I warmly welcome and which I think can achieve real benefits. The government has never really taken consumer affairs issues very seriously. We have a relatively small consumer affairs bureau but it has primary carriage of very few issues. Most of the important consumer issues are dealt with by other departments and, just as an afterthought, sometimes the consumer affairs department is invited to give its comments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I am not anxious to let the banks off the hook either. They have behaved with all the subtlety of a herd of rampaging elephants. It was highly offensive for the banks to come out within days of the Prices Surveillance Authority review into bank charges with suggestions of further increases. The banks need to respond to the matters that the Prices Surveillance Authority has raised about their levels of charges. We need to look very sensitively at those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, in this particular statement a number of things are dealt with in relation to the protection of consumers. The government has made a commitment, which I commend, to seek the development of a national scheme of easily understood consumer protection law to replace the current overlapping and sometimes inconsistent law. That is a classic example of a motherhood statement that everybody would support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do need to have much more consistency in consumer protection laws between the states. However, the goal of uniformity in consumer law can only be achieved through cooperation and consultations with the states, which generally have the legislative power in this area. Past history suggests that it can be a very slow process to achieve this sort of agreement. In fact, the Director of the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations, Jenni Mack, in commenting on this particular initiative, and welcoming it, stressed that its success would depend on actions by the states and on uniform agreements reached by the Council of Australian Governments. She then threw in the very obvious comment that these are bodies `not noted for quick or consultative decision making'. Sadly, there is a long process likely to be required to achieve that degree of uniformity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will soon be in government and will have the responsibility of implementing this announcement. It is committed to vigorously pursuing the development of uniform and readily understood consumer protection laws and it will be working and encouraging the states to work towards that objective as a very high priority. There are some areas which obviously need immediate attention. For example, there are areas where transactions which cross state borders can make it difficult for manufacturers and suppliers to comply with appropriate standards, and there are areas where appropriate dispute resolution procedures are not available because state boundaries get in the way. These sorts of things need to be addressed as a matter of priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also welcome the proposal to develop standards for consumer complaint schemes. One of the positive developments over recent times has been the development at state and national level of industry based ombudsman schemes. It has to be said that some of these are working very much better than others. The obvious example of dismal performance has been the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. In fact, that has got off to such a bad start that there is an inquiry in the other place at the present time going on into its performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A real problem with the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal is the lack of a broad based jurisdiction. It is interesting to note that more than half of all of the written complaints that have been given to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal have been struck out because of lack of jurisdiction. In addition, there were 5,188 telephone enquiries which led to only 881 written complaints. The obvious reason for that is that the telephone inquiry quickly established that the body in most instances did not have jurisdiction over the areas of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one obvious problem is that the complaints tribunal has so far not had the capacity to deal with medical evidence. They were promised that they would have that jurisdiction by May but then the government backed off and now there is a promise that it will be there by November. Frankly, any further delays by the government will be unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned though that there are so many other matters that the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal seems unable to deal with. I think all of us in our electorate offices have had complaints over recent times about the very poor performance of many superannuation funds and generally that is also outside the jurisdiction of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are few things that the Tribunal can actually deal with but even those that it deals with proceed so very slowly that in a year since it began operation over $1 million of taxpayers' money has already been spent and it has the grand record so far of handing down 12 decisions. It has 416 active cases and, of those, 321 were still at the inquiry conciliation stage, 83 had completed the inquiry and conciliation, but only 12 had gone to the review hearings. So this is an example of an ombudsman scheme that has really got a long way to go to be considered effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, also in the insurance field are the general insurance industry review panels. I think their performance has been quite commendable. They deal in detail with the matters put before them and consumers have a very good record, with about 55 per cent of all of the reviews finding in favour of the consumer. The way in which they deal with issues seems to be thorough, efficient and commendable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, not everyone is always happy with all of the findings but, frankly, some of the stories that are put before them would make really good novels. It is amazing what some consumers try to put over their insurance companies, too, so fault is not always on one side. This body has done well in trying to deal with those issues, and it is interesting that the number of complaints is reducing. I think that is a sign that the industry itself is responding to consumer concerns by adopting better standards and being prepared to recognise that business and industry have a responsibility also to their consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a proposal in the statement to work towards developing common standards of independence, impartiality, accessibility, efficiency, effectiveness, openness and accountability. If there is to be widespread consumer confidence in the ombudsman schemes, particularly when they are industry based, this sort of thing is desirable. The coalition is also happy to commit itself to working towards the development of a more comprehensive ombudsman system to ensure that in every instance high standards are not only set but actually achieved. That is a very worthwhile objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a need to look at gaps in the ombudsman schemes to ensure that no areas of complaint fall between the various jurisdictions. There are a number of examples of that at the present time, and I hope that this proposed review can deal also with that sort of issue. It is important that the various ombudsman offices maintain integrity and are regarded by the community as balanced and fair in assessing the various issues that are before them. Some very worthwhile initiatives are being taken up in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the Trade Practices Commission, presumably eventually the ACCC, its successor, is also to be given greater powers and resources to pursue consumer protection issues. That is also an important initiative. I suspect that because of a lack of resources the Trade Practices Commission has tended to devote maximum effort to corporate fraud, crime and major issues that are headline grabbing. Ordinary consumers with perhaps just their own complaint against a particular manufacturer or a supplier feel that their issue is not being regarded by the Trade Practices Commission as worthy of having the necessary resources devoted to it. That is disappointing because the Trade Practices Commission needs to be a body that supports the little person as well as deal with the high-fliers in Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also proposals to deal with post-sale consumer protection, which has been identified in many areas as a matter of considerable concern. I believe that the issues I have mentioned are important, and it is good to see consumer issues being addressed in a justice and equity statement. As I have said, however, so far the government has not demonstrated any capacity to act to support its empty rhetoric and it is now time for some action. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the Justice Statement, I suggest to the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) that the words he used, `empty, hollow comment', are very appropriate to what we have just heard in this place today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really are faced with a totally policy free opposition. For members of the opposition to stand up in this place and criticise the government for the Justice Statement when they do not have one policy point to raise is nothing but empty, hollow rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at access to justice, the first thing we in this parliament always should recognise is that the bulk of justice is in the hands of state governments, not the federal government. The vast bulk of Australian citizens who have recourse to legal proceedings do so through state instrumentalities: the courts of summary justice, the district county courts and the supreme courts of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the states, which are now principally controlled by the opposition parties, we can see the attitude to access to justice. If we look at Victoria and at the Liberal-National party coalition governing it, the first thing we notice is massive cuts to legal aid, and in the actions of the Liberal and National parties we see a denial of access to the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria today, large numbers of people appear daily in magistrates' courts charged with offences which have the potential for conviction and gaol. These people appear in court totally unrepresented because the National Party and the Liberal Party in that state do not care about access to justice. Community legal centres and community organisations in Victoria are being slashed to the bone, ripped into by the government, while coalition party members stand here and say, with hollow rhetoric, how concerned they are about access to justice. If they are really concerned they should go to Victoria and talk to Jeffrey Kennett and say, `Put your money where your mouth is,' but, no, they sit up here policy free, with no suggestions for change, and are critical. They should just go to Victoria where the people know full well what the Liberal and National parties stand for: it is certainly not to provide access to justice for ordinary Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important and innovative statement that the government has brought forward. As my colleague the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) correctly pointed out, it is evidence of a government which has not lost its way and which is maintaining its Labor priorities in ensuring that ordinary people are provided with appropriate services and access to justice, because a denial of access is a denial of justice. People who do not get access to legal services have no justice at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many points have been raised in the debate so far and there are several that I want to touch on. The first is the increasing tendency for the legal profession in Australia, encouraged by governments of both political persuasions, to charge what are known as contingency fees. It is a process whereby a legal firm can advertise and say, `We will handle any legal case without fee unless we win,' in other words, `You come to us and take potluck at our financial risk and we will sue who you want us to sue and we will do what we can to get you megabucks.' Let me say that I dislike such a process intensely; I find it offensive. Increasingly I am very worried about the way our legal professionals are going when they are advertising along the lines of `Come in at no risk and we will sue.' I oppose it and I think we are heading the way of the United States whereby we will have legal firms in this country issuing or inventing quite outrageous causes of action simply for the fact that they can take 10, 20 or 30 per cent of the gain if they are successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what is happening in the United States, the most litigious country in the world, with a legal system I find appalling, unprofessional and outrageous, and I am very concerned that that is the way we are going in this country. I just want to place on record today that, when it comes to access to justice, I do not think that improves justice and I do not think it improves access. It prostitutes, in my view, the legal profession; it is unprofessional. Other people may disagree with that, but I am firmly of that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that worries me greatly also, as a former practising lawyer, is the enormous increase in the number of lawyers in this country. There is in Victoria, my home state, a lawyer on every street corner struggling to make a living out of a diminishing share of the marketplace as the numbers of lawyers increase. As in any group of people who need to make a living, they will stretch professional integrity to the nth degree in order to maintain a living in a very tight marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really think it is a great tragedy that young people are still flocking into our law schools seeking law degrees on the basis that they will enter private practice when there is simply no room for these people in private practice. I find it quite alarming that the number of law undergraduates in Australian universities today is larger than the number of current practising lawyers in Australia. If you stop to think about those figures, when each of these young people coming out with a white collar and a law degree has an expectation of a right to earn a good income, the fact is that they are not going to make it. You wonder what the legal professional in a professional sense is going to be like when it is going to be so overcrowded and so difficult to make a living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You see that today in Victoria, where the number of lawyers defaulting is increasing at an exponential rate. A profession I was proud to be a member of is now being viewed by the public as just a lot of leeches sucking on the public purse. It saddens me greatly that a profession that has got a long tradition in this country is seeing so many of its members dipping into their trust funds and basically stealing other people's money. I do not know about other states but certainly in Victoria it is happening at an alarming rate, and yet increasingly we are being told we should deregulate more, we should take away controls on lawyers and let the market work its own forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That worries me&mdash;I suspect that lawyers are under-regulated today&mdash;much as it used to annoy me as a former practising lawyer that there were all the auditing rules and the sheer amount of paperwork you had to do to maintain your trust account and your practice. If lawyers as a profession are going to breach the basics of honesty and integrity, then there is only one way to treat them, and that is to regulate them further so that we try and stop that kind of activity taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned my concerns about legal aid and I am pleased that the Commonwealth at least is looking at means of increasing legal aid. My worry there, though, is that, as the Commonwealth increases its contributions to the states, in Victoria they keep cutting them. This seems to be a pattern in Victoria. If you take Medicare, for example, in 1993 the Commonwealth signed a new Medicare agreement in Victoria and an additional sum of $500 million of Commonwealth funding flowed into the Victorian health system. Within two months of that statement, the Victorian Liberal-National party government cut $380 million of state funding to health and hence we have had over 800 beds closed. This is what happens in legal aid: anything we increase in funding, the Victorian Liberal-National party government immediately cut, so there is no greater access or no greater benefit for the people of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will see this again&mdash;that, as we increase the Commonwealth contribution to legal aid, we will see the Victorian Liberal-National party government increasingly cut their own component, and so people will be worse off in terms of accessing legal aid. Legal aid is essential, absolutely essential. As I said, it worries me greatly that I could walk into magistrates' courts in Victoria and see people facing the court without any legal representation at all, often not even knowing the structure of the offence with which they are being charged and often not even knowing the consequences of a conviction&mdash;and that conviction often carries a term of imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If our system is going to go that way, such that people face imprisonment without proper legal advice, I think this country will stand condemned for not providing sufficient resources to ensure that every person facing a gaol sentence is adequately and properly represented, whether it be in a magistrate's court, a district court, a county court or a supreme court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is true that superior courts, such as the Supreme Court, will not allow people facing capital charges&mdash;such as homicide, for example&mdash;to appear before the court unrepresented. Even though we no longer have capital punishment, the history of that goes back to the day when superior courts said that no-one should face without representation a trial where the punishment was death. We do not have it any more, thank God. Nevertheless, the courts still maintain the view that on serious charges a person must be represented. It seems to me that that principle&mdash;that people who face courts are entitled to appropriate and proper representation&mdash;should be carried through, as a matter of right, in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that the profession itself stands to be condemned for the excessive fees that it sometimes charges. But I am led to believe that, in Victoria now, even middle-ranking barristers will do a Magistrate's Court appearance for around $250 or $300, which is basically what it was some 10 years ago, when I was in practice. So maybe the competition and number of lawyers in the system is actually reducing the cost of legal service in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned my great concern about contingency fees. I really am quite horrified by the way this country is following the American system. May I say, with no disrespect to the United States, that there is nothing that country can teach us. There is nothing it can teach us in terms of social policy, and nothing it can teach us in terms of anything which involves decency, because its legal system is so appalling. Quite often, one just cannot believe it. Their social system is such that people fall out through the bottom. To stand outside the White House in Washington and be surrounded, every way I look, by homeless people, in the middle of what is said to be the world's wealthiest country, makes me come back and say there is nothing the United States can teach us. Yet we still seem to want to follow some of the things this most appalling&mdash;in social terms&mdash;country quite often does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of things here that really please me. I think the increase in funding for community legal centres is very important. Some years back, I spent every second Friday night at a legal referral centre run by the local council at the Greensborough shopping centre. Most of the local lawyers in Greensborough, in those years, did provide that service on a Friday night. It was really interesting legal work to actually have people come in off the streets, able to access competent legal advice at no fee or cost, and to be advising on which way they should or should not go with the particular concerns they had. I have often thought that we really need to have a lot more of those shopfront legal services available in Australia, and the fact that there is $30 million provided for in the Justice Statement for community legal centres, which doubles the existing funding, is indeed very pleasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other difficulty which the Justice Statement is seeking to redress is the difficulty that many people who were born outside of this country have with language communication in our justice system. There is no doubt at all that a lot of people who we think can communicate in English really do not understand the nature of the legal problem they are facing, be it civil or criminal, because of different comprehensions of the use of words. I think it is essential, if we are going to have decent justice in this country, that people who do have legal difficulties, either civil or criminal, are able to access competent and well-trained interpreters to assist them. That is another measure which is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter, which again pleases me, is looking at the Federal Court scales and initiating a Prices Surveillance Authority survey on lawyers fees. Our profession in Australia is a profession divided between the bar and solicitors. Even though in Victoria that was fused, in some states it is still a separate profession, and barristers need to be brought back into a fee scale system which is capable of public scrutiny. It is offensive when people can charge the sort of money that top QCs are capable of charging today, when they are the minority of the total profession and they take the biggest slice of the public cake in legal aid funding. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Justice Statement which has been issued by the government is, to my mind, an outstanding statement in canvassing all of those issues with which it deals. It is comprehensive and thorough, and certainly brings together a lot of the issues that have been of concern to the Australian community over a long period of time, as the member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) indicated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is based on the Sackville committee report on access to justice. That committee reported last year. It made something in excess of 70 recommendations&mdash;which, to a very large extent, provided a solid approach to the types of reform that are necessary within the legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Especially did it deal with the problems of inadequate access to justice and the inefficiencies of the court systems. The range and number of those recommendations brought home to everyone who was aware of the report the nature of the inequity which relates to the Australian legal system and the fact&mdash;again, as Peter Cleeland just indicated&mdash;that it tends now to focus more on rewarding the practitioners within that legal system than on dispensing justice to those who can afford to pay for it or to the majority of people who have become trapped in a costly legal maze. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the fundamental elements of the system that we live in is, and must be, the right of people to access the legal system, to have their grievances heard and redressed and, where necessary, to have judgment made by their peers. They are fundamental, basic elements; but, as a result of the complexity and cost of the legal system, to a very large extent they are becoming something which is not available to Australian citizens. To a large extent, that is what the Justice Statement attempts to deal with. It is a comprehensive statement. It covers 188 pages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to go through the contents, but I am heartened by the fact that chapter 1 deals with families. People express concerns about family instability and family breakups and the legal maze often associated with that: questions of what we used to call access and custody. Fortunately, a lot of the terminology is changing, but the difficulty being confronted by people in those circumstances has not materially improved. It has got worse. Perhaps the government's commitment to those changes contained now in the Justice Statement will make it possible for us to start to redress some of those growing inadequacies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Justice Statement was launched by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), with what I should also say was an outstanding statement by the Prime Minister, there were some reputable commentators who responded very well to it. I refer firstly to the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. I will read the first paragraph of that, because I think it is important that it get into our records just the same as it is in the public record of the media. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government's justice statement is welcome for its promise to make the law financially fairer and more accessible.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the two fundamental elements of that Justice Statement: financially fairer and more accessible. The editorial went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a democratic society such laudable purpose cannot sensibly be contradicted. There is political wisdom behind the decision to establish women's legal centres in each State and Territory&mdash;adding resources to family mediation and support services as well as allocating more money for legal aid advice. There is also merit in the proposals to reduce costs for the ordinary litigant and to boost public confidence in the justice system. This package, taken in total, sets a reasonable direction for reform.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a sensible, intelligent, balanced, reputable response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there were some cynics as well within the media. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> is a major metropolitan paper in New South Wales with great tradition behind it over a long period of time, but the last paragraph of its editorial said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is, perhaps, being unduly cynical to see the reforms as handouts to interest groups who will be vocal during the next Federal election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>Could I say to the editorial writers of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, `Yes, that is being unduly cynical.' Do they expect us to suspend government? Or if the opposition at some time in the long distant future comes into government, will the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> editorial writers expect them to suspend government before elections? Should governments suspend their initiatives? Do governments need to suspend the responsibility that they have to overcome injustice and to give people financially affordable access to the court system just because there is an election coming up? That is not very smart on the part of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, not very smart at all. Let me say again, `Yes, it would be unduly cynical for them to make such a claim.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put it into context. Because the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and a lot of the other media commentators have become accustomed to good government, their judgments become harsher and they become more demanding. That is understandable. A fine day gives you a measure against which you assess what the alternatives might be. If you do not have the fine days, you do not know how bad the crook ones are; but when you have a fine day, it can always be just a little bit better. That is what the community and some elements of the media do with this government. We have provided good government. But as the Prime Minister says from time to time, every time we do something good, the commentators and the community lift the bar, like the high jump. `Well,' they say, `you have done pretty well. You got across that bar. Now try that.' And you get across that one and they say, `Now try that.' The bar rises all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put this Justice Statement, a great statement, into context. I say it is part of the whole mosaic of good government. Since we have been in government, we have been responsible for the most significant period of industry restructuring that this country has ever seen. Australian industry now, as it was never before, is competitive; it is flexible, it is adaptable, it is efficient&mdash;right across industry. I know there are problems. In the process of that restructuring, problems emerge. And, yes, we have looked after those people as well to a very large extent, the people who would have been bearing the burden of that restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been fiscally stringent. We have been fiscally responsible. For the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, during the 1980s there were four occasions, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would recall, when this government budgeted for a surplus. Everyone wants a surplus, and we gave them four&mdash;with a cumulative surplus of $18 billion over those four years. We did it again this year, and they said `Oh yes, but that's only because you are selling assets.' We have been fiscally responsible. We have been fiscally stringent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have provided a safety net in the area of social security or welfare. We have provided real increases in benefits to the less advantaged people in the community. We have finely targeted where those benefits go. We have extended the range of services to make sure that the safety net for those people in Australia is adequate so that they do not fall through it, and that people do not drop in and take advantage of the safety net when they do not need to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have restructured our priorities in the total budget. We have balanced social programs. We have developed infrastructure. We have assisted the states in a more adequate, more targeted way than was ever done before. We have restructured our defence commitment and we have done the same thing with overseas aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, we had the One Nation statement&mdash;one of the most significant statements that any government has ever provided in terms of indicating the nature, direction and volume of investment in national infrastructure. After that One Nation statement, people said, `Well, that is pretty good, that is okay, but now what are you going to do?' We said, `We will do something about the unemployment. We will have the Working Nation statement. We will target an increase of half a million jobs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next day they said, `That was pretty good, but now what are you going to do?' We said, `What we want to do is to determine the pattern for the future development of arts, craft, music, drama, skills and culture of the Australian people and so we will have the Creative Nation.' `Oh, yeah,' they said, `That's okay, but now what are you going to do?' So we said, `Look, as a result of the Mabo decision, the indigenous people of Australia deserve additional attention and we will legislate on the basis of that. We will give those people a level of justice they never had before. Not only that, but we will give them a land fund to make sure that the most dispossessed are able to get back some of that land.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They said, `Yeah, well, that's all right, but now what are you going to do?' So we said, `We'll talk about a vision for where this nation is going. We will talk about a vision for the pride, dignity, sovereignty, independence and self-assertion of this nation in terms of the republic that's going to occur in the future.' That was pretty well received as well and they said, `Well, what else are you going to do?' So we gave them a budget with a surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They said, `That wasn't a bad budget, but what are you going to do tomorrow?' So we gave them the Justice Statement. Some of the media, as I say, are pretty cynical about it. Perhaps some members of the community are as well. That is understandable. We can carry that burden because we know that that burden of criticism and cynicism is visited on us because we have provided good government. When we bring in our innovation statement, they will say with a yawn, `Oh, yeah, well, what are you going to do next?' I think they have been pretty tough in their judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been good government. This has been outstanding government. Of course there have been individual problems, individual inadequacies. There have been problems that have been created as a result of all those changes, initiatives and vision. We have made sure that where problems were created we gave attention to them as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Justice Statement gives priority to women's legal services, legal aid funding, the Family Court and community law centres. They are the types of things to which attention has been given but, at the same time, a whole range of other things have also been considered. On the question of effective competition within the legal service, we have found the value of competition in Australia by building efficiency and bringing down costs and prices. The same applies to the legal profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions of legal fees, gender bias on the part of judges, the wigged and gowned members of the court system and televising court proceedings are addressed. I know my colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham), who is an eminent legal person and chairs the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, has reservations about that. I do as well. I do not want Australian courts turned into a circus. I have seen circuses in other countries and I know the effect they have, not only on the position of those people, but also on the question of justice. The questions of consumer protection and the settlement of disputes outside the legal system were also given consideration in the report. It is a good report and a good statement. It reflects good, sound and continuing government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the government's Justice Statement. I am going to make some general comments later in my speech, but I want to talk initially about the benefit of this Justice Statement to my electorate in Cairns and Far North Queensland. Families in my electorate will directly benefit from a range of new services in the $160 million Justice Statement, which outlines a comprehensive national strategy for creating a simpler, cheaper and more accessible justice system. Cairns and Far North Queensland have already received significant federal government assistance to provide legal services and family counselling from this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cairns Community Legal Service received more than $158,200 to assist in providing community legal services, as well as dedicated funding for disability, discrimination, legal advice and advocacy. It means that, as well as a general lawyer employed by the Cairns Community Legal Centre, there is also an advocate in discrimination law. More than $63,300 has also been allocated to Centacare in Cairns to provide marriage and relationship education and counselling in 1994-95. In addition, Youth Link in Cairns received more than $117,700 for adolescent mediation and family therapy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of a four-year program under the Justice Statement, the government has significantly expanded community based services to help families in Cairns and Far North Queensland overcome legal problems. New support services, such as marriage relationship education services and at least one new financial counselling service, will be established in the Cairns and Far North Queensland region for funding under the Justice Statement. The government will also fund the Family Court to upgrade its Cairns registry&mdash;which is very significant&mdash;to give better access to Family Court services for people in Far North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's strategy encourages mediation in family law matters to help minimise the trauma of marriage break-up. It will increase the availability of counselling and mediation services throughout the Cairns and Far North Queensland region with new community based mediation services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Justice Statement funding will also build on these existing services with establishment of a specialist women's service linked to the existing women's service in Brisbane. It will be part of a national network of women's legal services established in response to the needs of women for specialist legal assistance in areas such as domestic violence and family law matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the overhaul of the legal aid system, the Commonwealth will substantially increase funding for legal aid commissions and community legal centres, such as the Cairns Legal Community Centre, while developing innovative new ways of meeting legal costs, such as the national disbursement assistance fund, which I will speak about later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, there has been an announcement by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) that an Environmental Defender's Office will be located in either Cairns or Townsville. I will certainly do everything I can to make sure it comes to Cairns. It will be funded to $70,000 and will become part of a national network made up of environmental defender's offices in every state and territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had an input into this part of the Justice Statement. I was lobbied by the national environmental defender's office organisation and I subsequently lobbied both the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) on this issue. I consider it very important that legal advice is available to community groups and individuals in relation to environmental law matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters are very important in my electorate and in a lot of other parts of Australia. We need to be able to provide people with adequate advice because, quite often, the people on the other side of these disputes&mdash;developers and the like&mdash;are well equipped to access advice. I am not saying I am against all development and developers, but they quite often have very good access to legal resources whereas community groups do not, and that is why this initiative is very important. Very clearly, the Justice Statement presented by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was very good for my constituents in that it addresses a lot of the problems they face in relation to access to justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now have some general comments about the statement, particularly with regard to the future, based on my personal experience as a lawyer and solicitor. I have had experience in private practice, I have worked as a salaried lawyer for legal aid commissions in two states, and I have also worked for the Public Trustee in Queensland&mdash;a body which, until recently, provided a great deal of free legal advice in a different area of the law to the people of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great disappointment to me that the Public Trustee decided last year&mdash;or perhaps early this year&mdash;to withdraw a lot of its services. That decision was certainly not in the spirit of the Justice Statement, and I ask the Queensland government to consider reversing the decision and restoring the Public Trustee services. People in remote areas, such as many in my electorate, received advice on drafting of wills, for example, and it also gave advice in relation to estates and the like. I hope that the Queensland government will read the Justice Statement and perhaps adjust that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advisory committee that produced the Justice Statement stated that there had been a lack of strategic direction at the national level on legal aid policy, resulting in inefficiencies and unequal access to legal aid. That is certainly an understatement. If you go to one state, you might be eligible for legal aid for one legal problem but, if you go to another, you may be ineligible. Some states have more stringent means tests than do other states. Some states have merit tests for some matters and some states do not. So it becomes a bit of a lottery. I will talk more about lotteries later because, to some extent, we still have a legal system where access to justice is unfortunately a lottery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud the measures in the statement to reverse this situation. They involve a more active Commonwealth role in legal aid policy and administration, which I welcome. An Australian legal assistance board will be given $16.8 million over four years for delivery of legal services in civil and family law. That is over and additional to the mainstay of the Legal Aid Commission, which is criminal law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Balancing civil and criminal law obligations for legal aid is a very difficult task for any legal aid commission. Some legal aid commissions have merit tests for criminal matters, and it seems to me that it probably is appropriate to have means tested delivery of services when there are limited resources. However, it is totally inappropriate to have merit tests in criminal matters. Basically, this initiative allows the legal aid commissions to prejudge the matter and to reverse the onus of proof. In lay terms, that is a reversal of the principle of innocent until proven guilty, and is something that should be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If only criminal matters are given legal aid, ordinary citizens feel that the legal aid system excludes them. Of course, a perfect legal system would be one which provides for a right to legal assistance for people in at least serious criminal matters, and a targeted system, by merit and means tested, for both civil and family law, supplemented perhaps by something like the national disbursement assistance fund that we have got in the Justice Statement. But we do not have a perfect system because there is a limit to funding by government or any other sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My belief is that there at least has to be some commitment by all states and the Commonwealth to fund legal aid from their budgets and not rely on solicitors' trust accounts or some other source in that regard. The reality is that, if you rely on solicitors' trust accounts, when there is a downturn in the economy, a downturn in legal work, that is often a time when you need more legal aid funds and that is a time when those solicitors' trust funds go down. So there has to be a commitment, I believe, from all states and the Commonwealth to provide legal assistance from the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the following comments. They are not on behalf of the government, but I think that, if we are going to have an equitable legal system in the future, we have got to really look beyond the Justice Statement and look to some sort of wholesale restructuring of the legal system in terms of delivery of legal services and also in terms of the litigation system. I think that in the future, if I might predict, we will have a legal care system as we have now got a Medicare system. I think in the long run that is the only way to provide justice and equity in terms of access to the legal system. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EV5">Mr DODD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not hear the honourable member's interjection but the obvious response is: how are you going to fund it? I think that the public, if it wants an accessible justice system, has to accept that there may be the need for some sort of levy like the Medicare levy. To keep costs down it would have to underwritten by perhaps professional indemnity schemes and some financial incentives. I think that that is one wing of a very important reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other wing of an important reform that would keep costs down is to implement&mdash;as the Whitlam government tried to do though it was thwarted by the Senate and the events of 1975&mdash;a no-fault compensation scheme. At the moment it is a lottery. If you go to one state&mdash;and I use that phrase advisedly&mdash;you get one award for a particular injury; if you go to another you get another award. If you happen to be lucky enough to be in a motor car and you lose your leg, you are at least covered by a compulsory scheme. But in Queensland, for example, if that happens because someone assaults you, you have got no hope of recovering, certainly in relation to any criminal compensation scheme. Of course, workers compensation schemes also would come into that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast that situation, where people have difficulty in receiving any sort of compensation when they are bashed senseless by someone in the streets, with a situation&mdash;and I do not want to make any comment about the person&mdash;such as the one where the courts in New South Wales awarded about $300,000 to Andrew Ettingshausen, money for damages arising out of a proven defamation because he was inadvertently exposed in some magazine. The public just do not see that as fair and equitable. The only way to resolve that is to really have a no-fault scheme coupled with greater access to legal aid. Then there might be eventually a fair and equitable scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time that I have got left I just want to make some general comments about matters that could be raised in the future. As a lawyer, whether in legal aid or in private practice, one of the problems that I came across was where people came wanting simple assistance for dissolution of marriage. I think that there should be some assistance provided but I think the Family Court could provide assistance. They insist on things being typed, they insist on the applications and the affidavits being typed and in a proper form. If the Family Court registry actually sat down and devised a simple, plain English form which people could fill in, we would have a system for access to dissolution of marriage which would be more equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot emphasise more the need, as has been highlighted in the report, for counselling services. As a legal aid lawyer, and in private practice, quite often people would come to me seeking legal advice when what they really needed was financial counselling. They had debts and they had the debt collector knocking on their door. They needed someone to sit down with them, go through their accounts, give them advice&mdash;not legal advice&mdash;and get them out of the system. There is even provision in my electorate for that but I think we have to do more than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we fund cases of national importance. It is important that any system fund test cases. It is also important, as I said before, that we fund the Environmental Defender's Office. But, if we do that, we have also got to reform the law of standing. It is not good and it is a particular problem in Queensland if we give people or community groups legal access to courts. If they are required to put up litigation bonds to take action against powerful forces in society, that effectively prohibits them from access to justice, and that is something the states will have to look at. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that on the government side I am the only non-lawyer who has spoken so far on this debate. I do so in the context of genuinely believing that this is not one of those debates where one is just going through the motions for party purposes and pushing a line that one does not really agree with. In contrast to the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), I actually think this is more than a grand gesture, more than hyperbole. I actually think there are some very valuable initiatives in this action by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the few areas I want to talk about that does not really concern my electorate is the issue of interpreters&mdash;particularly with regard to the Aboriginal community. In the Australian Institute of Criminology's `Trends and issues No. 47', John Walker and David Macdonald again refer to the high incarceration of Aboriginals&mdash;constituting, as they do, 14 per cent of the prison population. They, of course, went through the usual realities: Aboriginals are three times more likely to be unemployed, 2 1/2 times more likely to be in rental accommodation and 14 times more likely to reside in what are termed `improvised dwellings'. That again interrelates with the question of whether they will get bail, et cetera, and their incarceration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also said that, in addition, linguistic difficulties in some parts of Australia would make it difficult for indigenous suspects to communicate their situation to police. I guess we are quite aware that that also occurs in the court system. In the Northern Territory, Western Australia and some other areas, there can be no doubt that many Aboriginals are in gaol simply for want of an interpreter. We run around the place talking about other NESB groups, but I think this issue has been neglected. I am pleased that the government has done something about this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall thrust of the $160 million, which is not a meagre figure over four years, is&mdash;if anything&mdash;to limit the need to go through the court system and, in periods of anguish, worry, concern and stress, to try going towards mediation or other alternatives in some areas. It is also about simplifying the system and giving more access to information for people&mdash;if they have to go to court&mdash;to ensure that they have more knowledge. Equally, in the federal sphere at least, it is about requiring lawyers to give more information with regard to costs and alternative methods of reducing those costs. There is a big thrust in the overall proposal with regard to family services, domestic violence and community legal centres. There is also the issue of training for court personnel and judges to make them more aware of the changing nature of this country. There has also been a fairly strong effort on a diverse range of events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) alluded to his attitudes on gun laws. I put on the record my strong position on this issue. In fact, in my 1984 maiden speech in the New South Wales parliament, I concentrated on this issue. I am pleased to see that, in this particular overall Justice Report, the government is moving towards further restrictions on the importation of machine guns. The government also notes that it will seek that all territories and states tighten gun licensing requirements and that gun registration is introduced in those states and territories where it does not exist. We are going to find that some individuals will manage to carry out offences despite all the registration requirements in the world. We know that criminal elements can obtain guns, whatever the best efforts of the community, but, essentially, this country has started to go down the wrong road already in regard to the increasing number of people in possession of guns. In addition, there is a large number of people with a vested interest in resisting restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once you give people something, it is very difficult to take it back, and we are slowly drifting down the US cycle. Despite our culture and despite a lot more reticence about guns, unfortunately those first few steps have been climbed and there are more people who feel they have to have guns: they feel threatened; they feel that society is increasingly unsafe and insecure; and they require to be armed. As I say, I am pleased that the government, in a very broad document of about 190 pages, has emphasised that issue and intends to try and do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document also concentrates on a few areas that matter to my electorate in a very fundamental sense. In my electorate, 29 1/2 per cent of people over 15 years of age were born overseas&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;and 13 per cent of the entire electorate have been in this country less than five years. We have a number of initiatives in regard to non-English speaking people: assistance in professional development programs so that Family Court judges, Administrative Appeal Tribunal members, et cetera are aware of cross-cultural aspects; detailed research on the disadvantages faced by people of non-English speaking background in the justice system and focusing on determining the levels of unmet demand; introduction of reforms in legal aid at a national level to ensure increased access and equity in the legal aid system for people of non-English backgrounds; funding of women's legal centres to develop appropriate forms of assistance for women of non-English speaking backgrounds; and an overall emphasis on financial counselling, marriage guidance and other relationship support agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these initiatives are trying to ensure that people of non-English speaking background have equal access. I have got to say, having lived my whole life in an electorate where there are a number of new arrival cultures, that this is a fundamental problem. It is possible to see women who are, basically, divorced and shipped overseas by their husbands without knowing what day of the week it is. It is a situation where people, because of the language problem, tend to gravitate to a very small circle of solicitors who then have a captive market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that this a majority trend, but a minority of these solicitors come to this country with legal qualifications from elsewhere. They are, perhaps, imbued with the culture of these legal systems and the knowledge of how lawyers might operate elsewhere rather than the standards we might prefer in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, there is a very great problem in communities in areas such as the inner west of Sydney in regard to people&mdash;mainly women&mdash;getting access to our court system, knowing their rights and being able to fight for them, and being put into networks of people who can assist them. I see it in a real sense. It is a necessary effort to undertake to change this situation, and this particular document does something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting the overall expansion of legal aid, and there are a number of proposals for a national network of environmental lawyers. Honourable members are quite aware that, regardless of which party is in government in different states, there have been restrictions on who can undertake very necessary legal action on the environment. This proposal allows more rights to the individual through environmental lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is to expand the network of legal services and will establish a natural human rights and discrimination law centre, specialist litigation advocates in a number of existing community legal centres, and also, most importantly, nine new generalist community law centres. I notice that they are in a number of regions where there is obviously a need, and I do not think that people will quibble about the areas. The areas are: the Riverina area between the Victorian and New South Wales borders; the northern part of New South Wales; the central coast; and, close to my electorate, the outer west of Sydney, which is represented by the member for Chifley (Mr Price) and the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that huge housing estates have massive policing problems and socioeconomic characteristics and that the people who live in the estates have a proclivity to be involved in crime. These areas need this kind of community legal aid centre, and I put on the record my support for the government in undertaking the establishment of such a service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also another matter that I have been interested in locally. I am aware that, in the last few years, the St Vincent de Paul Society has initiated handover centres for separated couples. The actual process of arranging times and places and the questions of access are very often the source of great friction in those relationships. The St Vincent de Paul Society pioneered a scheme in New South Wales. In this overall Justice Statement, the government has taken those suggestions on board and is spending $5.3 million on prototype centres to see how well they operate. Those centres will have legal workers who are trained in dealing with family violence. That should reduce what is a very traumatic national problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of a national missing persons bureau, the figures are that in 1993-94 over 27,000 people were reported missing. They were a very diverse range of people&mdash;people with mental disabilities, people in stress situations, people with emotional problems, people who were abducted, et cetera. People can knock any kind of overall justice statement, but I think this national missing persons bureau is a worthwhile initiative by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bureau will be part of a national exchange of police information. Over a million dollars is going into it. There will be photographs here and overseas. There will be an emphasis on children who are missing and on foreign nationals who go missing within Australia. Once again, it is worth while, the electorate wants it and I am pleased to see it mentioned in the Justice Statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this document there are a series of proposals that deal with safety. One of the unfortunate developments in Western political systems over the last few years&mdash;and it was fairly obvious in the last state elections in New South Wales when the Labor Party did it, and next time around the Liberal and National parties will probably do it&mdash;is the attempt to exploit fears in the electorate about violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A document by the Australian Institute of Criminology mentions a 1991 survey which asked Australians and people in other Western countries whether they had a feeling of being a bit or very unsafe when alone at night. In Australia the figure was 31 per cent who felt unsafe. That is significantly above that of a number of European countries, with Belgium at 20 per cent, Finland at 18 and Sweden at 14. There is no doubt that there are concerns out there. We know that it is related to people's personal experiences and whether they have been victims in the past. People are also more inclined to be concerned if they are women or older people. Whilst I support the government trying to do something to reassure the electorate, I draw attention to Australian Institute of Criminology document No. 44, by P.N. Grabosky, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overseas researchers have concluded that the effect of newspaper coverage is complex, with some forms of coverage increasing fear and other forms of coverage decreasing fear. The effect of official crime rates on fear is also mediated through the newspaper coverage of crime. In Britain, readers of tabloid newspapers which have more sensational crime coverage reported higher levels of fear than readers of broadsheet newspapers, whose crime coverage is less predominant and less dramatic.</PARA>
<PARA>This applies to the political system as well. There is no doubt we can increase the fears of people, we can make them more inclined to support harsh regimes in prisons, and more inclined to demand that extreme measures be taken, but there is a public responsibility. The things that the government is suggesting in this scheme are worth while, but on the way through I must express concern about the developments in the political system in this country, and also in the media, that are leading to unnecessary, exaggerated fears within the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contingency fees are another matter that the government attempts to move on in this document, with $10 1/2 million for national disbursements essentially saying that, yes, it is a good idea to try to explore the possibilities of no-win, no-payment litigation. But there are initial, up-front fees that people often cannot pay, so this Justice Statement provides that money so that we can at least see how it will operate. Payments will only have to be made if the client wins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also proposals for a specialist women's legal centre. I am pleased to say that, as a state member of parliament, I had an involvement with the housing department in gaining premises for the women's legal centre in my own electorate. I am quite aware that, once it was established, it provided a useful part of the network&mdash;Immigrant Women's Speakout and other groups, and the Workers Health Centre&mdash;that provides a service for women. There is no doubt that these centres are necessary, that women have confidence in people of the same gender who are giving the advice. These will provide referral to other agencies, some advocacy and some representation, as well as giving a broad range of advice and information. In conclusion, I strongly support the document. I think it is a worthwhile initiative and I hope that the government is a bit more active in publicising it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airservices Australia has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The term `incident' is normally applied to an occurrence in which safety was or could have been jeopardised. Air traffic controllers and pilots, including international pilots under the terms of their company's Air Operators Certification, are required by Air Navigation Regulations to report all `incidents'. There was no reported `incident' in relation to the go-round of JA8141 on 1 May 1995. An examination of the radar tapes was not possible, as, there being no `incident' reported, the tapes were not kept beyond the prescribed fourteen days. The following responses are based on the voice recordings, control tower records and controller recollection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Controller observations and voice tape reply indicate that the go-round was commenced at a safe height and distance. From the voice tapes, JA8141 reported on an eight mile final at 2118.40z and reported `making go-round' at 2120.40z. `Z' time, or Zulu time, is the recognised abbreviation for UTC, which is Universal Co-ordinated Time, formerly GMT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) There is no evidence to suggest that safe separation between JA8141 and other aircraft was not maintained at all times. The pilot of JA8141 elected to go-round and did not advise the reason. It is probable that JA8141 was too fast and/or too high to execute the landing safely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) There is no evidence of a breakdown in separation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) There is no evidence of any `aircraft involved' with JA8141. The preceding departing aircraft was VH-WMY, a PA60 Aerostar of Crane Air Pty Ltd, which commenced take-off from the `lined-up' position on Runway 16R at 2119.23z. This timing indicates that WMY would have been airborne and in the vicinity of the upwind end of runway 16R at the time JA8141 elected to go-round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) There is no evidence of any non-compliance with Air Traffic Control (ATC) instructions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f) There is no evidence to suggest that correct standards and procedures were not applied by ATC at all times. There is no evidence of a breakdown in separation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(g) (i)-(iv) All operations were controlled from the old control tower, the new tower was not operational.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) (a) and (b) Only one Tower can have executive control authority at any time. A precise handover/takeover is required for the transfer of control. The timing of the handover/takeover will be such as to avoid any possible disruption to air traffic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The pilot in command carries the ultimate responsibility for the safety of the aircraft and may exercise his/her right to elect to go-round. Air traffic controllers are always conscious of the need to apply correct separation standards and procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) There has been no identified need to increase minimum separation standards.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr Lawrence</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) An increase in the Medicare levy of 64 cents per week for a person on average income is not likely to affect decisions to retain or take up private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) As I stated in the second reading speech on the Government's private health insurance reform legislation I consider that consumers are not getting a good value, high quality product in health insurance. I believe that this is a major factor in the declining participation rates in private health insurance. The health insurance reforms, which took effect on 29 May 1995, will place the health insurance industry in a position to offer a wider choice of products, achieve efficiency gains and pass on the benefit of those gains to their members in the form of lower or stable premiums and better controlled costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) There are no immediate direct costs to the Commonwealth from persons dropping private health insurance. However, the Commonwealth provides hospital funding to the States under the Medicare Agreements. Sub-section 25(5) of the Health Insurance Act (1973) and sub-clause 16.2 of the Medicare Agreements require that the amount of bonus pool funding be reviewed each time the percentage of the population who are covered by supplementary hospital table insurance falls by two percentage points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 15 November 1994 Private Health Insurance Administration Council (PHIAC) Report showed that the 2% trigger had been tripped with a 2.1% fall from the June 1993 to the September 1994 quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A review has now occurred and a report prepared for the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council (AHMAC). The report was also recently discussed at the Health Ministers' Forum and the meeting of the Australian Health Ministers' Council (AHMC) held at Alice Springs on 15 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No. Private health insurance provides for private hospital treatment and treatment as a private patient in a public hospital. Whether to maintain private health insurance is a matter for individuals to decide based on their personal requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) There was no proposal to increase the Medicare levy at that time. The Government considers revenue increases in the context of the Budget.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) and I are aware of the investment project to construct and operate Sydney's M2 motorway.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. Except in the context of an audit or investigation into a particular fund, the ISC does not normally seek or hold information on the individual investments and assets of superannuation funds, nor of the sums involved.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Rights of action and other remedies for investors who have acted to their detriment on the basis of false or misleading information contained in prospectus documents are set out in the Corporations Law, administered by the ASC. The Government does not guarantee the performance of superannuation funds. Investment decisions are essentially commercial matters for the trustees themselves, consistent with the Government's view that returns, and ultimately retirement benefits, will be maximised through private sector investment management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's framework for the prudential supervision of the superannuation industry is set out in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) (SIS) Act 1993. The SIS Act includes a number of `checks and balances' which can reduce the risk of adverse market movements or poor commercial decisions by fund trustees. These include codification of the main fiduciary obligations of trustees; a requirement on trustees to formulate and give effect to an investment strategy (which has regard to short and long term liabilities, risk/return, diversification and liquidity considerations); requirements for equal numbers of employer and member representatives on trustee boards; extensive information disclosure rules; internal and external complaints handling arrangements for members; and increased powers for the industry regulator, the ISC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, primary responsibility for the viability and prudent operation of superannuation funds rests with fund trustees. It is up to trustees to put in place appropriate mechanisms and internal controls to ensure that fund investments (whether made directly or through an external investment manager) are consistent with their fiduciary obligations to members and the fund's overall investment strategy, mentioned above. The SIS Act provides fund beneficiaries with a civil right of action against fund trustees where they suffer loss or damage as a result of investments that are not made in accordance with an appropriately formulated investment strategy.</PARA>

Where a jurisdiction is undertaking partly or fully State-funded projects, its LCA nomination will include amounts for these projects. Loan Council has released guidelines for measuring the LCA impact of the government risk exposure to infrastructure projects involving the private sector.</PARA>
