<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on this occasion to represent the opposition in this matter as shadow minister for transport. Obviously this relates to my own responsibilities within the opposition's ranks and, as it also deals with matters regarding aviation, I am also on this occasion representing my colleague Senator Parer who is the shadow minister for aviation&mdash;obviously not a member of this House but a member of another place, so I shall be representing him on this occasion as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see also that a number of my colleagues from this side of the House will be speaking on the amendments brought forward in the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 as they deal with a wide range of issues regarding transport, indeed, with every sector of transport&mdash;aviation, road, rail and maritime transport. So it is quite a comprehensive bill dealing with all aspects of transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing so, I might commence with the amendments that are related to aviation. This, of course, is an omnibus bill bringing together many different changes to transport legislation in the one bill. The aviation components of the bill before us deal with changes to the Air Navigation Act 1920. The principal purpose of those, as I understand them, is to place restrictions and requirements on the ownership of shares by Australian airlines. I think I am right in saying that it is to do with the sale of Qantas and other airlines, that it reflects government policy in its attempts to privatise certain airlines and imposes requirements in relation to foreign ownership and so forth. The opposition has no argument with that aspect of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next aviation component of the bill deals with the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959. It reflects concerns about the amount of insurance for passengers on commercial airline operations, and it comes as a consequence of a campaign that I have been involved with for some 18 months&mdash;ever since the Monarch aircraft crash of June 1993 in which seven people were killed. I knew six of the seven people who were killed. The crash took place in my electorate and I initially carried out some very minor investigations to see whether I could assist the families of the victims of the crash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that process, I discovered the inadequacies of our requirements regarding insurance. It appeared that, in reality, insurance was not compulsory for certain commercial airline operations. Indeed, it was possible for passengers to climb aboard a commercial airline flight in Australia, thinking that they were properly insured, only to discover that they were not properly insured. Even many of the ones who were insured were not aware that the liability for insurance companies amounted to a maximum payment of $180,000 per person affected by an airline accident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> So it became apparent to me&mdash;and, of course, to a lot of other people&mdash;that our arrangements regarding insurance for people who flew on commercial airlines were inadequate. It seemed totally inequitable that it was compulsory to have third-party insurance for cars yet it was not compulsory for airlines to have insurance for people who travelled on their services. It was also inequitable that, if you had an accident on an aeroplane, the maximum payment from an insurance company was $180,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience with Monarch proved the point very well. Members of this House would be interested to know that, 20 months after the Monarch crash, families of the victims of that crash have not received a cent from the company that insured Monarch. Not one single cent has been paid by Avsure, which is owned by Rural and General Insurance Ltd. This is despite the fact that Monarch held a paid-up insurance policy. Despite that fact, none of the families of the victims has received a cent from the insurance company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This gives us an opportunity to reflect on other accidents that have occurred. Another accident that affected people in my electorate took place in 1980 when an Advance Airlines plane crashed at Sydney airport. A number of people were killed in that accident, most of whom came from Temora. Their case ultimately took 14 years to resolve. It was not resolved until about April of last year. Fourteen years after the crash, insurance and other claims were finally settled. I think that, after 14 years, each family of the victims of the Advance Airlines crash received a grand total of $45,000. You can see from both of these examples that insurance arrangements for commercial airline passengers in this country have been most inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised these matters in a speech I made to the House in May last year. I am pleased to say that the minister responded to that in June or July of last year by ensuring that insurance is compulsory and by ensuring that the maximum payout is increased from $180,000 to $500,000, which is the subject of this amendment before the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though it is a sizeable increase in the maximum payout that a victim of an air crash can receive, it still leaves a great deal of inequity. If those people on the Monarch crash had been made, say, paraplegics as a consequence of the crash rather than being killed, the maximum payment they could have received from insurance would have been $180,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the members of this House: do we honestly believe that $180,000 would adequately compensate people who have been made paraplegics as a result of an accident? Anybody who thinks about it would realise that $180,000 would be lucky to cover the medical costs involved in an accident such as that. Certainly, $180,000 would not be sufficient to cover medical costs as well as provide sufficient income for those people to survive on for the rest of their lives. Compensation of $180,000 is totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst this amendment increases the amount, I pose the same question: is $500,000 adequate to cover all of the costs incurred by people involved in an aviation accident, given that they have to meet the cost of their medical expenses as well as have sufficient funds left aside to provide them with an income for the rest of their lives? Even $500,000 will not be sufficient to provide people with all their needs&mdash;to cover their medical bills and have enough set aside for the rest of their lives. Whilst it is an improvement, I still do not think it is adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is inequitable because we have seen many examples of somebody being made a paraplegic as a result of a car accident and receiving several millions of dollars in compensation. Whilst it was not a consequence of a car accident, a family member of a member of this House was involved in a very unfortunate and tragic incident which caused them to seek compensation. The amount of compensation that person received is adequate&mdash;it is in the millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw this to our attention because on a day-to-day basis we see people involved in incidents and accidents who are permanently affected as a consequence. Some victims are made quadriplegics or paraplegics, some lose a limb, or some are unable to work for the rest of their lives and they receive millions of dollars in compensation; yet, if the same consequence occurs to a victim of an air crash, the maximum sum they can achieve is $500,000. I put it to the members of this House that $500,000, even though it is an increased amount over what was there before, is still inadequate to compensate the victims who survive air crashes and suffer long-term damage to their health or to their physical wellbeing. It is an improvement but, in my mind, it is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some would say, `Surely you can sue the company because airlines are owned by big companies or by rich people.' Let me deal with that issue. In the case of the Monarch victims, the company was a two-dollar company. You might try to sue the owners or directors of that company to see whether you could get further compensation for the injuries incurred, or the losses incurred, as a result of that Monarch crash. But the reality with a two-dollar company is that a great deal of expense would be involved in taking the matter to court, and the likelihood of getting any money out of a company such as that is virtually zero. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The owner of Monarch&mdash;in this case a fellow by the name of Greg Scarf&mdash;has so far got away with the outrageous events of that accident completely scot-free. Despite the fact that he still operates a very substantial business, still lives a very prosperous lifestyle, the law is such that you cannot get to those sorts of people and get compensation from them. So you are dependent on governments setting in place proper insurance arrangements so that you can at least go to an insurance company and try to get money from it in a proper, reasonable and fair fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It raises the whole issue of how we look after people involved in aviation accidents. I would like to think that we could go beyond these sorts of amendments and look at other means by which we could further ensure that people involved in accidents are properly compensated. I would like to be able to involve people such as Greg Scarf, who as I mentioned earlier owned these airlines, in the future in these sorts of compensation claims. I think it is immoral that people who operated such an unethical and shonky airline as Monarch were able to get away with it scot-free, without having to fork out a single solitary cent, without bearing any punishment for the manner in which they operated their airline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This measure is designed to more adequately compensate people involved in aviation crashes. For that reason, the opposition is happy to support the bill. I know, as a consequence, people in the industry will say that this is a bad measure because it will add further costs to the operations of airlines. There is no doubt that it will add further costs, and I do not deny that possibility. But I pose the question to people who own these airlines: do they genuinely believe that, if they were made a paraplegic, a quadriplegic or were hurt permanently as a consequence of an aviation crash, they could live on $180,000 for the rest of their lives, after paying all the medical costs involved in that accident? The truth is that they could not. I doubt they could do so even with half a million dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst people in the industry will complain about this measure and say that it adds cost to the operations of their airlines, I think any fair-minded person would say, `This just has to be so.' It certainly will not disadvantage individual airline operators vis-a-vis competition because it will affect every airline operator. They will all have to pay the cost. Their competitive position against one another will not be altered. For that reason, I think this amendment should be supported by both those in the industry and by all members of this House. It will be certainly supported by those people who have been affected by aviation accidents over the years and by all people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a good amendment. In my view, it is not yet adequate enough because it still does not place a person involved in an airline accident on par with someone involved in a car accident, or a workplace accident or in an accident caused by some other event. Whilst those people can get several millions of dollars in compensation, someone involved in an aircraft crash can get only $500,000. At least it is a positive step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other component of the legislation deals with some internal arrangements to the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986 in a similar fashion to the way that it deals with internal arrangements to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990 and to the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983. In each case, the legislation gives the minister the right to express views to those government business enterprises. In return, it gives the minister the right of a proper and well-argued response from those government business enterprises. One would think that this would go without saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister responsible for a particular government business enterprise wanted to express a view to that enterprise, one would think that the GBE's board members and staff would listen and willingly respond to that view. But we have seen the need for this measure in recent times. For example, another government business enterprise, the Civil Aviation Authority, is an organisation which in my view has not acted in a responsible fashion. As a member of the aviation safety inquiry, I hear examples on a weekly basis of exactly why that statement is correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have an organisation that has had claims made against it that, on many occasions, it has misled the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and the public and that senior management on occasions has even misled the board of the organisation, we need to have the legal right for the minister to express a view to that government business enterprise and for that enterprise to respond to the minister's views in a well-argued and rational fashion. This is a necessary amendment and, again, is one which the opposition will not be opposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hope that the minister will find this a useful tool. As in many of these government business enterprises, the minister has the opportunity to give a direction. For example, the minister gave a direction to the Civil Aviation Authority just the other day. Whilst I know ministers are not keen to give directions to GBEs on a regular basis, this amendment gives the minister a halfway point between doing nothing and giving a direction. So it will be a useful tool to ensure that the public interest is maintained. That is an aspect of all three GBEs: the Federal Airports Corporation, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and the Australian National Railways Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other aspects of the amendments ensure that they have the ability to appoint their own chief executive officer. They deal with arrangements of transfer of staff from public service to employment by that particular authority, and they also deal with the ability of those organisations to make interim dividends to the government as opposed to a once a year, end of year dividend to the government. So they will bring forward revenue for the government, and I guess that is a good thing if you are a taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of the legislation before us deals with some changes to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989. As many honourable members would know, compliance plates are required for vehicles that operate in Australia. A number of categories of identification plate will be created, and this will be a better tool, if you like, in properly identifying vehicles that are imported into this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) has an excellent suggestion that I hope the government will consider. He will no doubt speak about it in greater detail, but the nub of it is that he believes that in order to overcome a great deal of the cost involved with stolen vehicles it would be an excellent suggestion if compliance plates that become the property of insurance companies be compulsorily returned by the insurance companies so that they can be destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many honourable members may not be aware of the fact that when a car is wrecked in an accident or whatever the insurance company in many cases ends up the owner of that vehicle. But a compliance plate is a valuable tool if you happen to be a thief, and the compliance plate is not compulsorily required to be returned by the insurance company to a proper authority so it can be destroyed. In many cases these compliance plates are taken and used to provide another identity for a stolen vehicle in such a way that you cannot prove the vehicle was stolen. The honourable member for Wannon has an excellent suggestion in this regard, and I hope the government will consider it for future amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of the bill deals with the Navigation Act 1912. I know the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) who is in the House today, as he always is on such legislation, will no doubt have something to say about this because he is always interested in the maritime industry. I am sure it helps at preselection time in a good, safe Labor seat. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know you do not need it. The legislation deals with removing the opportunity for double dipping, which I am sure the honourable member for Throsby would say never occurs, where maritime employees are on some sickness benefit that denies them the opportunity to both draw a wage from their employer and receive some form of income from the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. So this tidies it up. It deals with so-called sexist language and with the implementation of a system of ship survey and certification that is harmonised between the multitude of conventions that exist in the maritime industry around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 deals with so-called sexist language. There is nothing there that we would oppose. The Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Act 1986 deals with civil liability for oil pollution damage. Over the last few years this House has dealt in a bipartisan fashion with a number of amendments to the law to ensure that people who create oil pollution are properly penalised and made to compensate those who are affected by it. This aspect of it deals with civil liability. For example, you might have an oil spill or something or other that causes a fire which could burn your house down, burn out a national park or something like that, and this provides for a method by which people can be compensated for any civil damage done as a consequence of ships carrying oil which leads to some form of pollution and therefore damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last component of the bill relates to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. This is an area that I know is well received in the shipbuilding industry and obviously would be well received because the government over the years has been handing out considerable sums of money to people in the shipbuilding industry to assist in converting old ships to provide more efficient ships or to build more efficient ships from scratch. This is something the opposition has had some difficulty in supporting. We continue to be in that position because we believe that the main beneficiaries of reforms in the industry, the main beneficiaries of upgrading of old ships to make them more efficient, are the owners of those ships. Why should we turn around and pay money from the taxpayers' revenue to those people to do something which is in their own best interests in the first place? We have always opposed this particular component of the government's approach to the maritime industry, and we will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment is designed to ensure that, where overpayment to a person who has received funding under the Ships (Capital Grants) Act occurs, the government can retrieve it. Interestingly enough, whilst I do not have any specific examples, I understand that there have been instances where people have been paid moneys under this scheme and have not expended all of those moneys and the government has no legal course to ask those people to give back the money that they did not spend on the particular project that they received the funding for in the first place. So this provides the government with the authority to retrieve moneys provided by this grant that were not expended on a particular project. One can hardly oppose that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, the opposition will not be opposing this bill. We have a number of concerns about it, as I have mentioned, and some good and positive suggestions such as the ones the honourable member for Wannon will be making. My colleague Senator Parer, the shadow minister for aviation, has a couple of concerns in regard to the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959, which is about insurance. His particular concerns relate to the arrangements regarding foreign operators working within Australia. He will, no doubt, expand on those concerns in the Senate at a later date and put forward a very good argument for his concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, we will not be opposing this bill because in the end we believe it is in the interests of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it does point out the need for us to be continually changing the legislation in regard to transport as technology changes; to be continually aware of the fact that, particularly in aviation, there is a need to overcome some very serious deficiencies within the Civil Aviation Act; and to ensure that we are doing the very best thing for Australians who work in and use our civil aviation industries. I am sure many members of this House would agree with me that the experience of the last year or two has proven to us that we have some considerable inadequacies in that area and we need to be ever vigilant to ensure that we do not allow those to continue at the expense of innocent people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my colleagues for filling the government benches to allow members to hear me speak on this important legislation, the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. It is an omnibus bill amending aspects of the transport portfolio. As the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) said, with changing technology we are going to have more and more changes to legislation dealing with transport matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, my comments will be related to the maritime aspects of this legislation. The amendment to the Australian Maritime Safety Act 1990 changes certain aspects concerning the authority. It transfers the employment of staff from the Public Service Act 1922 to the authority which can determine the terms and conditions of service of its staff. The Navigation Act 1912 will also be amended. This bill amends part 4 of the act&mdash;which provides for the inspection and certification of ships under the provisions of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974 and the International Convention on Load Lines 1966&mdash;to give effect to a resolution of the International Maritime Organisation permitting the early implementation of the system of ship survey and certification that is harmonised between both conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hume referred to it as double dipping, but it is a tidying up. The bill removes the seaman's entitlement to wages where there is a duplication of a right to compensation under the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992. It also amends part 7 of the act to incorporate the terms and principles adopted by the International Maritime Organisation in its International Convention on Salvage which relates to the current provisions which are based on pre-federation United Kingdom legislation and the 1910 International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law respecting Assistance and Salvage at Sea. These changes provide greater incentives for salvage to encourage more timely salvage operations and assist in the protection of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides an objective standard and prescribed forms for testing the level of impairment by alcohol, or any other drug, for the purpose of section 386B&mdash;which makes it an offence for the master of a ship or a member of a crew of a ship to be under the influence of alcohol or any other drug to the extent that their capacity to carry out their duties is impaired. This bill also removes sexist language from the acts. These amendments enable the government to fulfil its responsibility to ensure safety of life at sea and to protect the maritime environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to acquaint the House with some practices in international shipping to which I believe that this House can no longer afford to turn a blind eye. When the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure travelled to various ports in Australia looking at ships we saw many examples of unsafe shipping&mdash;indeed, rust buckets. The committee report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> was, I believe, the catalyst for improving shipping, not only in Australian waters but in international waters. Indeed, the very term `ships of shame' has entered the international maritime language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that shipping is safer today because of the work of the committee and its report. I also firmly believe that there is a darker side to international shipping, and that is the condition of foreign nationals on ships: their living conditions, working conditions, food, and payment&mdash;or, as is often the case, non-payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is little short of a scandal that Australia, on a mere technicality, has not ratified International Labour Organisation Convention 147. Here we are today, tidying up deficiencies and bringing the language into modern day parlance. That is very important&mdash;but we refuse to tackle the really difficult issues. Many of the appalling conditions facing foreign crews could be solved if ships not complying with ILO Convention 147 were denied access to Australian waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the work of the Maritime Union of Australia and its efforts to highlight the inhumane conditions many seafarers have to put up with. For so long it led the campaign against the rust buckets. Now it is leading the campaign concerning crew conditions and pay. Officials such as Roger Chapman and Rod Paterson of the ITF and Tony Papaconstuntinos of the Maritime Union of Australia join a long list of trade union officials who have fought against the greed and inhumanity of foreign owners. They have argued against the dreadful conditions on many ships and argued for adequate wages and adequate food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen crews in Port Kembla who have been fed only watermelon for a week. Things that we take for granted in Australia are denied to the seafarers of many of these foreign ships. I have heard stories for some time concerning death threats against crews and their families and of the famous black list, which so many people deny exists. It exists, all right. It is compiled and held in the Philippines and anyone who knows anything about maritime unions knows that a black list exists. But time and time again, ship owners and officials deny that this black list exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recently as the ship safe conference in Sydney in September 1994, ship owners denied any knowledge of the list. `These things do not happen on our ships,' they told the international audience. To hear owners, charterers or their representatives speak at these international conferences, you would think there were no unsafe ships on the seas of the world, and that every crew was well treated, well fed and well paid. If only it were so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of example, on 18 December 1994 the ITF took action on behalf of an Indonesian crew on a Panamanian registered vessel, MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sheng Ho</EMPHASIS>, to alleviate a contractual problem which meant that the crew had not been paid. That action resulted in the crew being awarded $US229,780 in back pay&mdash;over $A300,000. On 20 December, a couple of days later, the Indonesian crew received the following letter:</PARA>

<PARA>I really am surprised that when I am attempting to draw the attention of the House to an international scandal, which concerns not only non-payment of wages but death and death threats the opposition would try to deny me speaking time. It is important that this be put on the public record, particularly in Australia. It is a scandal that the opposition should try to deny me my democratic right to say this and deny me my speaking time. As I was saying, when this amount of over $A300,000 in back pay was recovered, the crew were told that this money would have to be repaid. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the partners can fulfil this request of ours and in pursuance of this we attach a letter of appeal from the Indonesian Sailors' Union. We thank you for your attention and cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA>What in fact happened, as has happened in the past, is that the owners tried to make a farce of the payment of the back wages by making sure of its return while at the same time making sure that the ship was not detained at Port Kembla. Make no mistake, that ship would have been detained at Port Kembla until every cent of that back pay was paid. The owners agreed to the payment of the back wages which would immediately have to be returned to the captain when the ship cleared the port, but the crew did not have the money on them. It was paid into an account. We have been caught with this farce before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the ship&mdash;and I stress that this was a vessel subchartered by BHP, the big Australian&mdash;reached Port Klang in Malaysia, representatives of the owners boarded the vessel and demanded the return of the back pay. From reports I have received, this was done with death threats against the crew and their families. The crew refused to comply and, as a result, they have all been sacked, and I believe that they are now on that black list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have in my possession documents concerning this, proving that what so many have been saying was not occurring has in fact been occurring. The treatment of the crew, their pay and conditions, is an international scandal that will only be solved with and by an international solution. The conditions these people work under is like slavery&mdash;slavery that was abolished 90 years ago. Just as the conditions of ships could not be solved by one nation, neither can this situation. Of course, overriding all this is the greed of the international shipping community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that the shipping industry is competitive but surely, as has been shown all along our coastline, it is better to have well trained, multiskilled crews being paid a decent wage. This way we would have a smaller and more productive crew rather than a large, untrained, half-starved, flogged and usually underpaid crew. There is a real concern that these vessels are being chartered or subchartered by some unscrupulous firms in Australia. It is also worth remembering that those who talk of opening a second register in Australia, indeed of opening Australia's coastlines further to foreign crewed and foreign flagged vessels, also want to introduce this form of slavery to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No government can sit idly by and let this happen. We must raise these concerns in this parliament, but also our representatives at the IMO must continually raise them. We must not only rid the coastline of ships of shame but also be prepared to engage in the fight to rid the world of the inhumane treatment that too many seafarers are subjected to. We moved decisively to end slavery in Australia 90 years ago by stopping the recruitment of kanak labour. Why are some people now suggesting that we introduce slavery in Australia? Dress it up as they might, this is what a second registry for foreign seafarers on the Australian coastline would mean. </PARA>

This convention is designed to ensure that compensation is available to persons who suffer oil pollution damage as a result of maritime casualty involving oil carrying ships. The 1992 protocol increases liability limits and extends the scope of the convention. It replaces an earlier protocol adopted in 1994, which, because of a particularly onerous entry into force requirements, is unlikely to enter into force internationally. </PARA>

I do not know how much compensation we would have to have to clean that up. It is not necessarily the oil carrying ships&mdash;this is restricted to oil carrying ships&mdash;but often the bilges that spill oil. The spill that recently occurred at the top end of the Great Barrier Reef was not from an oil carrier but from a bilge, when they wash out the bilge and let the oil go. We will have to come to terms with that in regard to the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>

But, if some of the rust buckets carrying these chemicals up and down the Australian coastline run aground or there is a major spill, we would not know what had been put into the sea. We would not be able to see it. We would not know that there had actually been a spill until the fish started floating to the top of the water or people who got a mouthful of water actually died.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to talk on this bill, the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. I will confine my remarks to part F of the bill which talks about amendments to the Motor Vehicles Standards Act 1989. In particular, I want to talk about yet another area where the government seems to be perpetually dragging its feet. Of course, I am referring to the motor vehicle compliance plates that are used to identify each new vehicle that is sold in Australia and the fact that the government seems to have had considerable difficulty in coming to grips with the fact that it could do a lot more, through the use of compliance numbers, to reduce the level of theft of motor cars in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), talked about scandals. Let me tell you of another scandal, the level of theft of motor cars that goes on in Australia. It is approaching a billion dollar industry. And yet it seems that the government&mdash;despite many warnings over many years, despite some very sensible and very serious submissions that have been put to it over many years&mdash;has failed to act in this very important area. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying, this is another area where the government has failed to act. I am rather pleased to see that the former minister for land transport, the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), has arrived in the chamber because during his time as a minister he was urged time and time again to act on this issue. Yet, like in so many areas, he failed to take up the challenge. The minute he ran into something that was difficult, he did what a typical <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> minister would do and did nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am talking here about motor vehicle theft and the opportunity that the government has had over a number of years to take some positive steps to reduce this very onerous cost on the country, not to mention the difficulties it causes to so many individuals when they suddenly find that their cars have been stolen. In many cases, the cars are never returned. To give some idea of just how serious this problem is, we should realise that the number of vehicles being reported stolen&mdash;I emphasise `reported'&mdash;has been in excess of 100,000 a year. In fact, in 1994 it was 125,000. While it has increased slightly, it is still a very serious number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The direct cost to the community is around $400 million a year. But there are many additional costs, including the inconvenience to so many individuals who have lost their cars, the costs in police having to try to chase things up and the cost in the courts when prosecutions are mounted. When you add up all these other costs, it is not unreasonable to say that the cost to the community is of the order of $1 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The frustrating thing about all this is that the government has had offers made to it of quite simple solutions to this problem. While I acknowledge that the manufacturers have moved in quite a strong, demonstrable way to reduce the ease with which people can steal a car, it is still quite an attractive thing for those who want to get into an organised racket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the figures in New South Wales where the problem has been greatest, in 1990 the cost of car theft was estimated to be $226 million and in 1991 it had risen to $280 million. In 1992-93, theft related insurance claims cost the insurance industry $190 million. Guess who pays for this: this, of course, is passed on to the policyholders in the form of higher insurance premiums. According to the Insurance Council of Australia, in 1992-93 the theft costs added nearly 10 per cent to the insurance premiums. The RACV estimated that it was in excess of 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRMA, the National Roads and Motorists Association, in New South Wales in 1993 calculated that the theft added an average of $46 per year to every premium paid by every Australian car owner. When you think about it, that is a major cost. Nearly $1 a week extra is paid by every person who owns a car just to try to pay for the cost of this theft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With car theft, it is not just the odd vehicle that is taken and disappears altogether. It is estimated that at least a quarter of all cars that are stolen are stripped down and sold for parts or are on-sold again for profit under a new identification number. While this is serious enough in itself, it does not take into account the fact that 62 per cent&mdash;nearly two-thirds&mdash;of thefts do not involve insurance claims. So, when we talk about a figure of $1 billion, we are probably underestimating it quite a lot. So the community cost is very large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Theft rates have fallen slightly over the last three years. But it is still a very big issue. As the shadow minister in 1991, I called on the government to look at a very simple solution that was being offered. That was to use the vehicle identification number on several major parts of the vehicle. The Motor Traders Association of Australia has been raising this with the government since 1989, so it is not a new idea. Yet to date we still do not have any action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) is here. I should have thought that she would be rather interested in this sort of thing too because it ought to be something about which she is directly concerned as so many consumers are being affected by the fact that they have to pay more for insurance&mdash;as I say, nearly $1 a week because of motor vehicle theft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This solution is remarkably cheap and simple. The figures estimate that it would only cost $15 per vehicle to bring in this identification of major vehicle parts. Yet it seems that the government has failed to take up the offer and has failed to take this matter seriously. One really has to question where their priorities are if they cannot see the seriousness of this whole issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, insurance premiums would only have to be reduced by about five per cent to recoup the full cost of doing this. These labels, which are now available, can be put on the major parts of a vehicle in a way that they cannot be removed or, if attempts are made to remove them, they can self-void.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nearly a quarter of the vehicles that are stolen are stripped for parts or resold under a different identification. People ought to realise that this is not just a random thing. A number of organised, highly professional syndicates are operating this racket. These syndicates know what they are doing: they are so well organised that they steal cars to order down to the model and colour. There are many suggestions that at motor vehicle auctions people are working their mobile phones and actually buying cars as they come up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some work has been done in the United States on this whole issue where it has become mandatory for high-risk parts to be marked. It has meant that since 1984 it has been that much more difficult for people to get hold of those vehicles and then strip them for their parts. In America up to 100 parts per car have been marked. The Motor Traders Association suggested that only 16 would be necessary, so it is not a big cost. Indeed, the cost could be easily recouped by lower insurance premiums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that all of this information has been available to the government. In fact, there have been formal requests of the government for this for a number of years. Yet again, as this legislation demonstrates, the government is not prepared to act on an area which, if implemented, would have significant benefits for Australia over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing to note is that the number of people actually charged with stealing motor vehicles is remarkably low. In fact, only about 2.8 per cent of cars stolen result in a person being charged. That is less than three per cent. It is very disturbing to think that, although the number of people being prosecuted is very low, this is costing the community over $1 billion a year. One would think that the government would take this matter seriously and do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Currently, aluminium labels have the vehicle identification number on them. While they are quite easy to read, adhesive labels with a self-voiding provision are now available. In other words, the minute someone tries to tamper with or remove it, the label self voids. That would take away one of the avenues people in this organised racket can use. They currently take the compliance plate off one vehicle and put it onto another. This removes the opportunity to trace a stolen vehicle because the identification number has been removed altogether from that first vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is clearly an area in which the government is going to have to move. Given the extent of theft, given the cost to the community and given that all those who insure their motor cars have to pay for this enormous cost, the government should be beholden to take action. I find it rather appalling that, after all the opportunities that have been put before the government over the years, the government has again failed to take up the challenge. This legislation demonstrates yet again that the government is not prepared to look at this whole issue. I would have thought that, through the transport ministers council that meets regularly, this and a number of other issues could be addressed so this major cost to the community could be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of recommendations have been put up within the last year. One recommendation was that when a vehicle is re-registered or registered within another jurisdiction it be mandatory for identification plates to be checked. Yet not even that is done. Given that the major motoring organisations have expressed their concern over a number of years and given that there is a simple solution, I believe that the government has a lot to answer for in relation to the level of motor car theft in Australia. Yet the government is not prepared to act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> The Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, which is before the House, is a very wide-ranging bill and provides me with the opportunity to speak on two matters very near to my heart. The first matter that I wish to address is the increasing availability of private finance to invest in infrastructure projects such as those outlined in the One Nation statement. This response for an acceleration of infrastructure investment will bring about two very welcome positives: it will create jobs and it will boost the economy. As well, the projects contemplated by investment agencies have the potential to improve immeasurably the quality of lifestyle in employment opportunities available to all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If corporate participants and governments can work together&mdash;and there is no reason why they cannot&mdash;private sector involvement in public infrastructure will see the completion of projects which hitherto have been but a wish or a dream in the minds of parliamentarians, civic leaders and constituents. I have an expensive dream for my electorate of Hunter, which I believe will come to fruition because of private infrastructure investment. I am confident that the pet projects of nearly every member of this House can be realised through the application of private infrastructure investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1992 the growth in Australian superannuation funds&mdash;an attractive, alternative funding source for infrastructure projects&mdash;has been substantial. Daily income for Australian superannuation funds is $486 million, with total assets currently standing at $4,186 billion. If the commonly adopted diversification strategy implemented by most superannuation funds is applied then some $37 billion of these funds will be invested overseas in either equities, bonds or fixed interest deposits. Because of advice from asset consultants and fund managers, superannuation trustees embrace this strategy in order to adhere to the diversification philosophy rather than to any great desire to invest in overseas equity or bond markets. Given the opportunity and a reasonable range of alternatives that would satisfy normal investment criteria whilst not sacrificing diversification of investment, many Australian superannuation funds would redirect these moneys back into the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Institutional investors are showing more interest in infrastructure projects which promise good rates of return in comparison with long-term bonds, plus there are tax advantages. The funding of public infrastructure projects by private, personal and institutional investors is certain to progress rapidly in this year and in coming years. This process, while not having its genesis in the One Nation statement, will certainly be assisted by the effective use of infrastructure bonds and it may be possible, through the development of other government tax incentives, that principally institutional investors will look on infrastructure projects as a legitimate alternative to overseas investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should the government proceed with the introduction of compulsory employee superannuation contributions, it would make the task of selling this to the Australian public much easier. If those same employees had a choice of investment, given the well-known Australian conservatism to savings, the attraction of investing in large Australian infrastructure projects would assist in the introduction of what is going to be a most difficult strategy. With both Lend Lease and the New South Wales super corporation recently announcing major ventures into infrastructure after assembling teams to work out the necessary risk return profiles, institutional investors are looking hard at the area. Estimates of the rates of return vary, but an existing infrastructure project might be expected to return 15 per cent before tax and inflation and much more for an unfinished project where the risks are somewhat higher. As the rates for a finished project compare well&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

That is already happening. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gunnedah basin, 320 kilometres north-west of Newcastle, contains in excess of one billion tonnes of identified recoverable coal reserves, and that figure is based on the 1994 New South Wales coal industry profile. These reserves contain good quality coal of both thermal and coking varieties. The coal industry has generally considered the Gunnedah basin as the logical replacement for the Hunter coalfields as its economic reserves are expended.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prospect of such a large-scale development of the Gunnedah basin reserves, however, has been negated by the fact that, due to the distance from the port of Newcastle, the cost of transporting the product on the current rail system is prohibitive. The prime reason the current rail system is inadequate for viable transport is the Liverpool Range to the north of Murrurundi and the steep grades associated with the crossing of the range. For many years there has been consideration by various parties with vested interests in the development of the Gunnedah coalfields to the driving of a tunnel through the lower level of the range which would immediately allow the capacity of trains servicing the field to at least double from some 3,200 to 6,400 tonnes, according to SRA figures. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, interstate freight runs along this line from Sydney to Adelaide and Perth and is overseen by the National Freight Corporation. Interstate passengers also travel over this line, and that aspect is overseen by Australian National which runs the Indian Pacific service. I remind government members that the east-west rail line, as opposed to the Sydney-Melbourne-Adelaide line, is 400 kilometres shorter; it is six hours faster; and it runs over flatter terrain. The line is already there and it is in very good shape. It is welded between Molong and Broken Hill. I believe that no responsible federal government should let it go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is talk that the Indian Pacific will be re-routed onto the Melbourne-Adelaide line. It would be a tragedy if that happened. While I have no objection to Indian Pacific passenger trains running on the Melbourne-Adelaide line, they should be in addition to what presently runs on the east-west line through Parkes and Broken Hill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales government, through the SRA, spends about $75 million a year on western area rail infrastructure. Over the last couple of years the New South Wales government has spent $4 million on building three 1.8 kilometre crossing loops between Parkes and Broken Hill and $1.3 million on an on-line fuelling facility at Broken Hill. That is indeed a handsome commitment to the line. Crewing has also been rationalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This line is particularly vital to the little towns in western New South Wales in my electorate. Ivanhoe is one of those towns and 30 to 40 residents are employed in the rail industry. To see this line close because of re-routing of freight and interstate passengers would be a tragedy. The line is also important to other towns such as Mendindie and Condobolin. I believe that every effort must be made to keep Indian Pacific passengers and freight running interstate along this line. The federal government should oversee the negotiations that will take place between Australian National, the National Rail Corporation and the SRA. The federal government should assist where possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that the federal government has spent something like $12 million on refurbishing the Indian Pacific in recent times, and that is very welcome. However, the federal government charges probably twice that amount on the diesel fuel freight tax alone. If that tax were removed it would tend to make interstate passenger rail servicing and interstate freight servicing much more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to see the New South Wales government make a commitment that if the Indian Pacific is re-routed, it will run an Explorer train service on the line to maintain the intrastate passenger traffic.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment now on other parts of the bill and on road funding in particular. I again record my dismay that this federal government has slashed federal road funding from something in excess of $1,600 million to a figure barely in excess of $800 million over the last two years. I believe that is a scandal. It has put tremendous pressure on maintaining, let alone upgrading, the road system in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it has done this, the government has continued to increase fuel tax. When this government first came to power in 1983 it was collecting about 6c a litre in fuel tax. Today that is in excess of 32c a litre on unleaded petrol and diesel, and in excess of 34c a litre for leaded petrol. Just over $1 billion of collections from fuel tax in 1982-83 has blown out to over $10 billion this year. It would have been even higher had the coalition and opposition parties not been able to stop an extra 3c a litre which the government wanted to put on leaded fuel in the 1993 budget. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventy five per cent of domestic freight transport in this country is by road, and 80 per cent of that is carted distances less than 100 kilometres.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993 budget, in particular, impacted very heavily on the average semitrailer running costs. We were not told anything about this before the election, I might add. The fuel tax increases on diesel alone added about $6,000 a year to the cost of running the average semitrailer. The sales tax increases alone added about $400 a year. That meant that freight costs had to go up and that has already put about $3 a week on the average family grocery bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the towns of my electorate of Parkes&mdash;perhaps not so much in Sydney and Melbourne&mdash;these increases have added about 12.5c a kilometre to transport costs. I saw figures the other day for a semi carting cattle long distances. The recent fuel tax increases were adding about $1.80 a head to the cartage costs. The package we took to the Australian people at the last election would have taken about $60,000 a year off average rig costs.

The coalition, I am pleased to say, has made a federal commitment to seal that road upon return to government.

The Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987, which we are discussing today, makes mention of benefits to shipowners for modifications made to vessels to bring them into conformity with the revised crewing levels of the shipping reform program. I think it is pertinent in that regard to again raise the need for continued reform on the waterfront. The waterfront has been a national embarrassment to Australia for years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the number of wharfies employed has fallen substantially, the cost to the people that use these facilities has hardly changed at all. With the $100,000 golden handshakes for the wharfies who have been retrenched, which has cost something like $430 million so far, it is no wonder the costs have not come down, because much of that has been paid for by cargo levies of $1.25 a tonne, levies which still continue, I might add. </PARA>

The wages on the waterfront vary somewhere from $60,000 to in excess of $90,000 per year. If we compare those amounts with the massive investment made by the farmers in my electorate in their industries, often in excess of $1 million, we see that the farmers work far greater hours and take a far greater responsibility, and many, if not most of them, are earning a negative income. We must not lose sight of that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Transport Legislation Amendment Bill raises several important aspects of transport policy in Australia. In this regard I refer the House to the findings of the National Transport Planning Task Force, released last December.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task force also noted the extensive changes and improvements in Australia's transport system over the past decade. For that, this government can take a large slab of the credit. It found, however, that in several areas micro-reforms have not reached their full potential and now need to be reignited. I will quote from page five of the report which states specifically:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">road regulation reform, where the agreed process seems to have stalled&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">port authority reform, where&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the benefits have been captured by state government treasuries rather than customers.</PARA>
<PARA>It is acknowledged, and I believe now broadly accepted in this House, that the greatest barrier to economic efficiency in Australia is the cost of federalism; that is, overlapping and confusing responsibilities, regulations and planning priorities among and between Australia's three tiers of government. The National Transport Planning Task Force provides an instance of the cost of federalism at page 55 of its report. I refer all members interested in transport reform to the report&mdash;and I know this is an instance in which my friend and colleague the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) would be closely interested. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transport manager of a Perth firm which carts dangerous bulk liquids awarded a contract for the construction of a 25m tri-axle B-double trailer to a Queensland company. To move the newly constructed empty trailer to Perth operating permits were required from the states through which the vehicle would pass.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither the NSW Government nor the Commonwealth had in place legislation which dealt with this type of vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was therefore necessary to avoid transiting New South Wales and the vehicle had to be moved via the Innamincka Track.</PARA>
<PARA>I assume that is somewhere in Queensland, as the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) would understand. It states further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three sets of operating permits were required from Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In South Australia and Western Australia each required the trailer to be inspected by dangerous goods inspectors and each inspection cost over $10,000. Additionally, registration and driver licensing laws, stamp duty, third party insurance and a myriad of other hurdles had to be negotiated. The paperwork alone took over one month.</PARA>
<PARA>In a nation wanting to compete and to be efficient on world markets, we really do need to overcome these costs of federalism. I am pleased to have learned from my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe), that the Commonwealth will soon be bringing the appropriate legislation to this parliament. It remains for the New South Wales government, alone among the governments of Australia, to get its act together and bring forward the nationally consistent regulations and arrangements needed to avoid these huge business costs on Australia's export potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to address the bulk of my remarks on this legislation to its amendments to the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 which specifically provides for the minister to notify the commission of his views on the appropriate strategic direction for the commission in the performance of its functions. It is not possible to frame, or understand, transport or infrastructure policies in the 1990s without regard to the requirements of our internationalised economy. The efficiency of government business enterprises is all important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission has estimated that government-supplied inputs account for 16 per cent of all intermediate inputs used by Australian industry, equivalent to six per cent of total industry costs. Transport and energy are the two most important inputs. A high proportion of export industries and factor resources are dependent on rail transport. Rail freight accounts for more than eight per cent of the total costs of the mining industry, 12 per cent for the coal and oil industries, 11 per cent for cereal grain producers and nearly 20 per cent for ferrous metal ore producers. The performance of these government business enterprises has a significant impact on the competitiveness of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> EPAC has estimated that best practice reforms to government business enterprises in Australia can add 2.5 per cent to GDP. Rail has a huge role to play in this process. The Industry Commission has identified potential gains of $5 billion per annum in GDP from rail reform. Seventy per cent of these gains would result from improved work and management practices and using cost savings to reduce rail deficits. The other 30 per cent would arise from pricing reforms to achieve full cost recovery. These gains would result in improved efficiency of resource allocation with subsequent flow-on effects throughout the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Benchmarking studies have shown that the pace of rail reform must accelerate to reach national standards, let alone international best practice. In 1992-93 railways were responsible for 23 per cent of jobs in government trading enterprises, but only six per cent of government revenue. The first benchmarking goal in rail must be to match Australia's internationally competitive road transport industry. Competition with road transporters should be used as a catalyst for productivity gains and rail industry upgrading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and associated benchmark is against international best practice. Despite recent reform efforts and improvements in efficiency, the performance of the Australian rail freight system falls short of world standards. The Bureau of Industry Economics reported in its 1993 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rail Freight Update</EMPHASIS> that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . whether on the basis of price, operating efficiency or cost performance rail freight services are clearly below best practice and this poor relative performance impacts directly on the competitiveness of Australian firms using rail freight services.</PARA>
<PARA>Labour productivity in the most efficient overseas railways was nearly eight times the Australian average, while capital productivity was four times greater. Overall, the Australian systems must reduce their 1991-92 operating costs by about 27 per cent, or close to $600 million, to match world best practice costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The differences between international and Australian efficiency partly reflect national operating conditions. The BIE analysis shows that, at current rates of improvement, Australian freight will reach world best cost levels in 1998-99. The acceleration of this process and further improvements to operating costs require additional capital investments by each of the Australian systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Since Federation, the greatest cost to infrastructure and economic efficiency in Australia has been the cost of federalism. At least on rail freight, substantial progress has been made through the establishment of National Rail. Its emerging success is an outstanding example to all governments in Australia of how cooperation and a national perspective can improve our economic performance. We are doing it on rail; we can do it on road and eliminate some of the problems I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> All Australians can be encouraged by National Rail's 1993-94 results, with a seven per cent growth in customer revenue and a four per cent increase in freight market share. National Rail, to its credit, has set performance improvement targets commensurate with Australia's trading position&mdash;it is a dynamic outfit looking outwards to the world environment, trying to assist Australia's trade prospects&mdash;that is, it hopes to reduce operating costs by 45 per cent in real terms and increase labour and capital productivity by at least threefold by 1995-96, the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> National Rail is taking steps to improve work practices, increase wagon availability and improve the reliability of its terminal equipment, while increasing the number and quality of capital city services. I know the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) is very supportive of those reform initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government's other rail entity, Australian National, is expected this year to transfer its interstate freight functions to the National Rail Corporation. It will be reviewed to ensure that the ongoing organisation is appropriately structured and functional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These initiatives would be enhanced by two further reforms. I urge them upon the minister and the government, particularly in the consideration of the national transport planning task force report. First, there should be established a single system to manage interstate rail passenger services. The shifting of public transport costs between levels of government is never as important as efficiency gains available to all Australians, regardless of their state of origin. On the east-west corridor between Sydney and Perth, where passenger services are operated by Australian National, substantial benefits have already been realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, Australia's rail freight systems should be integrated. While it may be logical to exclude metropolitan passenger traffic from the national rail network, it is totally artificial to separate interstate and intrastate freight operations. No freight system has pursued a proper plan to rationalise and enhance its services. An integrated and truly national system is essential to the attainment of international best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now turn, Mr Deputy Speaker, as we all must on rail reform, to the Hilmer report and national competition policy. The report recognised that because of economies of scale and distance, `natural' monopolies may exist in some industries. Duplication of the rail system, electricity grid and gas pipelines is not economically feasible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to lower prices and greater efficiency in these industries is the creation of access for upstream producers and potential downstream competitors. Hilmer recommended an open and transparent system of declared access to essential infrastructure facilities at fair and reasonable prices. Adherence to the principle of competitive neutrality would prevent governments from unfairly subsidising their enterprises in competition with private firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provision of third party access rights is not a new initiative on Australian tracks&mdash;it is not new at all. For many years BHP has been able to operate its own trains over sections of the New South Wales rail network. Its extension to all parts of the infrastructure sector is an essential reform. In the absence of competitive markets most of the productivity gains of public business enterprises in Australia have been realised as budget dividends for governments rather than cost benefits for consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1990 and 1992, for instance, labour productivity in the State Rail Authority of New South Wales improved by 12.7 per cent, Queensland Railways by 11.5 per cent, the Victorian Public Transport Corporation by 2.9 per cent and National Rail by 16.4 per cent. But the average cost of sending rail freight improved only at the margin. Costs to industry fell by just 5.1 per cent in Queensland despite their large increase in labour productivity, 2.5 per cent in Victoria and only 0.6 on the national line. With even more extravagant dividend stripping, the average cost actually increased in New South Wales by 5.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From Hilmer's agenda it is competition not ownership in its own right which promotes efficiency gains in infrastructure. The debate in this regard should not focus on the relative market shares of public and private owners. I notice my colleague the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) in the chamber. He would appreciate that in Victoria it is not competition they are interested in; the Kennett government is obsessed with private ownership. They are willing to dismantle the way in which the public sector can efficiently compete with the private sector, with an ideological obsession that the private sector always does best. That is not the case. The private sector should be given an equal opportunity to compete against government business enterprises but not monopoly opportunities&mdash;not the sort of monopoly sell-off the Kennett government has as an obsession on its ideological agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at federal policy in regard to the introduction of private competition on a level playing field against the public authority on telephones. Much as the advent of Optus has enlarged the telecommunications market, efficiency gains through competition in rail are likely to attract customers from the road industry and expand the scope and potential of all rail freight enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as much, competition policies are not necessarily synonymous with privatisation&mdash;a message all members of this parliament should take to the Victorian government. The primary objective of the reform agenda is to promote competition where it is likely to add to national competitiveness. The case of transferring ownership as a means of improving efficiency depends on whether privatisation is likely to produce additional net benefits to the economy, not an ideological obsession that the private sector always does best. It is a matter of judging these instances and prospects case by case with regard to the principles of competitive neutrality and the proper role of the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hilmer's model is consistent with the European Community's policy on rail transport. That is, to define the tracks as an essential facility and promote competition between track users. British Rail, for instance has split itself in two: one section is a track authority earning a commercial return on track rentals; the other as a residual trading enterprise competing for franchises against privately owned companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The British rail system has been divided into 25 route packages. Earlier this year the first seven passenger franchises were opened for competitive tendering. Three leasing companies have been established to make available the rolling stock for passenger services. This lowers an important barrier to market entry by reducing the up-front capital costs of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia the first signs have emerged of a competitive market in rail freight. Road Railer Australia is hoping to position itself as a viable commercial competitor to the National Rail Corporation. The Hunter Valley rail project in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, has the potential to introduce internationally competitive freight rates for coal haulage and break down the monopoly profits currently levied on the coal industry by the State Rail Authority. Mr Deputy Speaker, as an outstanding supporter of the coal industry in the Hunter region, you would understand that its international trading prospects rely on the efficiency of the transport system. The lower the cost, the more viable the industry and the more sustainable the jobs of coal workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the idea of competitive neutrality between the public and private sectors in transport operations. I also support advancing the notion of competitive neutrality between transport modes. Let us not just leave this as a question of ownership, let us get down to true efficiency in the transport system. There should be in Australia a more level playing field and greater competitive neutrality between road and rail transport. Currently, the system is not fair. It is not competitively neutral. For instance, when a government builds a road, it looks only at the potential community use. There is no demand for the government to make a financial profit on road construction. However, there is a movement towards commercial costing of new rail projects; that is, governments are expected to make a commercial return on capital outlays for rail projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past two decades, real Commonwealth capital outlays on roads have been 10 times greater than all forms of federal rail funding, including rail operating subsidies. The unlevel playing field goes further. Nowhere in the public sector is there a cost recovery expectation on road maintenance, yet we are moving towards full cost pricing on rail to recover all the recurrent costs. Equally, there is no focus within the parliaments of the nation on road operating losses for government, but there is a huge focus on rail operating losses. As well, road is not subject to any taxation of its externalities, such as pollution, congestion and each of the other problems that come with certain aspects of road transport. Rail has few externalities. If that were built into the competitive equation, there would be much greater government investment in rail transport in this country than we see at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This federal government has been keen to promote the provision of private infrastructure in Australia. This is a logical response to the fiscal constraints placed on all levels of government in the 1990s. The infrastructure bonds introduced in the One Nation statement have now been enhanced by the Working Nation white paper, with a 33 per cent tax rebate for bond holders. Even with the best facilitation of private projects, however, infrastructure in Australia will remain primarily a responsibility for the public sector. Currently, just 11 per cent of national infrastructure outlays are funded from the private sector. Government capital spending is a crucial determinant of Australia's economic competitiveness. With more extreme climatic conditions and diversity of landscape than any other country, this is not an easy task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, on an island continent with disperse population centres, economic efficiency inevitably depends on the effectiveness of the transport system. Whenever the economic distance between markets is reduced, Australia enhances its competitive advantages for both domestic and external trade. Governments should regard transport investment as an essential structural reform, not as a function of the business cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach taken by One Nation, recognising the importance of transport to the nation and its regions, should not be restricted to pump priming the economy. Capital spending has been used as a swing instrument in the federal budget, inversely proportional to rates of economic growth while directly proportional to the size of the budget deficit. Better outcomes can be achieved through consistent long-term strategies for the nation's infrastructure and capital spending. Recurrent outlays are better suited to the role of a swing instrument. I am confident that this approach will soon be adopted nationally. It will be led by this government, using the findings of the National Transport Planning Task Force. We should recognise the importance of competitive neutrality and more rail investment, especially for the regions, to make our country economically competitive. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the series of amendments the most major amendments are those which include changes to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act, the National Railways Commission Act and the Federal Airports Corporation Act. The changes to these acts include revised accountability arrangements for the Commonwealth authorities and the government business enterprises which are involved. The amendments ensure that the lines of communication are improved between ministerial officers, the authorities and the enterprises involved.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties we have had in the past has been getting sufficient flexibility in the way our public enterprises operate in market environments and retaining some semblance of accountability, ministerial direction and, should I say, control. These enterprises and corporations belong to the public of this country, the people of Australia. They are managed by the government and by the executives of the enterprises in the interests of the people. Given these sets of amendments, it is entirely appropriate that we should be strengthening the accountability of these enterprises while at the same time maintaining their essential ability to operate flexibly in the Australian national economic environment. </PARA>

I happen to represent in this parliament a strong manufacturing region of the Commonwealth: Geelong, in the seat of Corio.

In the regions, such as the one I represent, it has never been more so than today. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a national community, and as a highly urbanised population, we have come to appreciate more the links between the transport system, the quality of our environment and the national economy and its performance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the internal to the external sense, Australia is geographically located away from many of its major markets. We must ensure that the process does not just stop internally and that we achieve efficiencies in linking the regional markets, which I represent in this parliament, with the external environment. The transport network is absolutely critical to maintaining the competitiveness of our regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The transport systems are very important to our standards of living. I have mentioned the importance of these systems in an economic sense but not in an environmental sense.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned that transport issues are critical to the development of our regions. Getting goods to the larger markets and to the international economy is a major task. The Kelty task force, which recently reported to the government, addressed these issues quite specifically. It identified the following key issues: the need for better and safer roads and linkages to the national highway system; improved linkages between the various modes of transport and improved facilities for the transfer of goods between the various modes; and better rail and public transport systems not only in our cities but also in our regions. It also commented significantly on the effect to regions when transport services are cut back. It should be remembered that, for many regional communities, transport, infrastructure and the provision of transport services are not just economic issues but also social issues. I share the view expressed in the Kelty task force report provided to the government that `better transport is an investment in growth and not a drain on the community'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I represent a regional community in this parliament which is particularly blessed with transport infrastructure assets in road, rail, sea and air. As far as Geelong is concerned, it is well serviced by the Princes Highway. That highway links Geelong to its major market in Melbourne. At some stage the communities of Melbourne and Geelong in the state of Victoria will have to give consideration to a third lane stretching from Melbourne to Geelong. Under the one nation statement we made some inroads into that task, but it is one that ought to be considered now rather than later and factored into infrastructure expenditures over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Princes Highway also links Geelong to its productive western district hinterland. Of course, Geelong is linked by good road systems in the form of Great Ocean Road to the surf coast&mdash;a fast developing region of the state of Victoria. These linkages are very important. They link Geelong to its major hinterland areas which produce wool, grains and other commodities. They also link Geelong to an area of great growth: the Great Ocean Road and the surf coast area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government, which I represent here on the floor of the parliament, has acknowledged the importance of an efficient road system to the Geelong region. As I mentioned, through the One Nation package we commenced the task of putting in a third lane in the Geelong-Melbourne highway. We completed the dual carriageway on the Portarlington Road which links the urban developments on the Bellarine Peninsula with Geelong proper. The Bellarine Peninsula is one of the fastest growing areas in an urban sense in Australia. That particular road is most important for residents living on the Bellarine Peninsula and for strengthening the economic linkages between the towns on the Bellarine and the city of Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We completed the dual carriageway from Geelong to Torquay, regarded as the gateway to the Great Ocean Road, which has provided the stimulus for economic development and an impetus for tourism in the whole surf coast region. It is tourism that this region is looking towards to stimulate job creation and economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that there were federal funds provided to complete the Western Ring Road in Melbourne which now links Geelong and surf coast regions much better with the Melbourne market, northern areas of Victoria and southern New South Wales. Under that same program the federal government put over $14 million into the black spots program to improve road safety in the region. Under the building better cities program we have put $2 million towards a new bus interchange in the city of Geelong which will improve urban transport in that city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as rail services are concerned, Geelong is linked to Melbourne by a very fast and efficient commuter service. One Nation moneys were provided to upgrade that line and to improve commuter travelling time. But perhaps of more importance was the government's decision to link Geelong into the national standard gauge network which was commented upon by the honourable member for Werriwa in his speech to the parliament this morning. The improvements that this will bring to freight movements in the region and to linking the region into the national market are incalculable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as sea traffic is concerned, Geelong is particularly blessed with a bulk handling port which ranks as one of the great bulk handling ports in the nation. It is a major handler of petroleum, grain and other bulk commodities, and it has considerable potential for further development if handled correctly, and I will comment on that in a minute. The government reforms have already played a very important part in improving the efficiencies of this particular port. The government's waterfront reforms and its program of micro-economic reform have seen enormous efficiency gains in the port of Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a decrease in the work force of some 50 per cent, and the multiskilling of those workers who have remained. There have been substantial reductions in operating costs and lifts in profitability, and this has been reflected in the reduced charges to port users. We now see the port of Geelong as a very important source of regional investment both in terms of infrastructure and economic goods and services that are bought within the city of greater Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is with some consternation that I reflect on the decision of the Kennett government to privatise this port. This is being done</PARA>
<PARA>against the advice of major sectors of the Geelong community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussions I had with business leaders and others when the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) recently visited Geelong, the business community spoke of the stupidity of the Kennett government walking down the line of privatising the port of Geelong. It is nothing short of plundering the assets of the community. I really question why in January this community in private was so vehemently opposed to the privatisation proposals, yet one month later came out in public strongly supporting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as air services are concerned, we have an asset of unbridled potential in Avalon Airport. This area offers great potential for growth in passenger and freight movements. I point to the stimulus that has been given to Avalon by the recent decision of the government to award a contract for the maintenance of military aircraft to E-Systems, ASTA and others in that consortium. It will secure the skills of the area and will certainly give an impetus to developments that are occurring there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to announce to the House that recently Hazelton Airlines, one of the major rural and regional airlines in Australia, commenced a service into Avalon airport.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we need to revisit one of the major recommendations of the Kelty task force, that Essendon be closed and general aviation activities be increased at Avalon. This will give a great stimulus to the plans to develop this particular part of the Geelong region. Avalon has a great potential not only for a passenger service but also for a freight service, with a productive hinterland that can provide goods that can be exported by air through this particular facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the future is concerned, it is really time now for the Geelong region to examine more closely the development of its transport infrastructure assets. There is enormous potential for planned development if we get it right.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geelong has the potential to become a regional transport hub, with the magnificent transport assets which I have mentioned to this parliament. It is now time for the community to think closely and clearly about the intermodal linkages that will need to be effected to improve the efficiency of Geelong's transport network. Of course, we need to look at continually upgrading the great transport infrastructure assets that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to link the port of Geelong to the national standard gauge network. The port of Geelong has recently completed a feasibility study that suggests that there are great economic advantages to the region if this particular linkage is made. But if the Kennett government goes ahead with its privatisation of the port of Geelong, I wonder whether those linkages will be made and I wonder about the accumulated economic expertise that has been built up over time in the port of Geelong, which serves the Geelong community so well. I fear for its dissipation in this mad privatisation that is taking place in the port area. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure has been dealing with the question of the insurance cover for passengers of general aviation aircraft.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the aviation industry people tend to think that all of the protections that apply to the major domestic and international airlines flow on to smaller aircraft. Perhaps someone has an aircraft and he wants to fly from Nambucca Heads to Walgett. He invites four of us to join him and we share the costs. We must ask ourselves if we are protected in the event of the unthinkable happening. On many occasions there is no protection at all. With this legislation we want to ensure that everybody&mdash;particularly in the charter area&mdash;is covered. The private area is not covered, but at least the charter area will be.

It is a massive act and it contains a lot of areas worthy of modernisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to part IV of the act, the provision for inspection and certification of ships, flows from two conventions&mdash;the 1974 International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea and the 1966 International Convention on Load Lines of 1966.

All that information is now being published in the major nations. The European Community is moving to the same system and extending the information. The United States Coastguard is also expanding on our recommendations.

It was being loaded at Porta di Madeira at Brazil in November last year, and during the process of loading broke its back and sunk at the berth. That situation excited the interests in earlier times of our iron ore and coal loaders in this nation because they did not want to see the prospect of their loading facilities being disrupted by vessels becoming disabled or breaking up at the berth and so putting their own facility out of action. </PARA>

Then the two halves were floated and towed out into the Atlantic and scuttled at a site that was selected by the Brazilian navy. I mention that because it is current information.

What has arisen out of this agreement are things like the reduction in crew size&mdash;that is also covered in this legislation and I will come to ship's capital grants a little later on&mdash;and the reduction in the crew to berth ratio. Also the continuity of employment has been improved. Shipowners say that they invest a considerable amount of money in the training of crew and they want to see that trained crew member spend a longer consecutive period on board their vessel to get the benefit of the training effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, there is a considerable amount of improvement to take place in the Australian shipping industry. I am pleased that that is being done by agreement between the shipping industry in this country and the maritime unions that are involved. In addition, a group has been formed, the shipping services task force 2000, which arose out of a conference on Australian shipping in Launceston on 17 and 18 August last year. I participated in that group. That group is moving to get a wider Australian recognition of the dimensions of the Australian shipping industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In summing up the debate on the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill, I would like, first, to thank the opposition for its assistance in helping us pass this legislation. I would like to compliment the various members from both sides for their contributions: the members for Hume (Mr Sharp), Parkes (Mr Cobb) and Wannon (Mr Hawker) from the opposition side; and the members for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), Throsby (Mr Hollis), Werriwa (Mr Latham), Corio (Mr O'Connor) and Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) from our side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As can be gathered from the debate, there has been considerable interest in the House in the issues related to the maritime industry. Australia is a very large user of international shipping. We have a quite proud history in seafaring, in our own way, and there are lots of things being done on a whole range of kaleidoscopes at the moment to expand and enhance our role in shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly commend the member for Shortland and his House committee for the work they have done&mdash;I have done so in the House before&mdash;in the past particularly in the area of ship safety and for the work they continue to do in safety in the whole transport field. That work is obviously of considerable interest to the members of the committee. It causes them to make very well-informed contributions in these debates. These things are obviously to the credit of the members and the House. The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and I do appreciate the interest and support on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some amendments that I will be moving shortly which will incorporate the provisions of the 1989 convention and they will establish environmental protection as a goal of salvage operations in its new reward system. The fixing of that reward, I might add, takes account of the skill and efforts of a salvor in preventing and minimising damage to the environment in salvage operations, moving to another field of best practice in those issues in our part of the world. It is true to say that the provisions of the 1989 convention have broad support within the international maritime community. They also have the support of state and territory governments, and industry organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding the debate I would like to just repeat a point I made during the second reading speech yesterday. The work that is being done in Australia, particularly in the protection of the environment as it relates to shipping, is being recognised at international levels. It is with some pride that we can note that the International Maritime Organisation has declared the Great Barrier Reef zone as a sensitive area for shipping purposes. It is the first area to be internationally so declared. I think that is quite a feather in the caps of the various officials and people who have been involved in the maritime debate and in presenting Australia's expertise and credentials in this field. I thank all who have been involved and the opposition for its support of these legislative changes. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill gives legislative force to a number of non-budget measures, improving the effectiveness and delivery of a wide range of social security payments. Several initiatives are to assist families, especially those taking on new parental responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under current arrangements, family payment for a newborn child is backdated to the child's birth if a claim is lodged within 13 weeks of the birth. Similarly, when a newborn child is placed with an adoptive parent, family payment is backdated to the time when the child entered the parent's care if the form is lodged within 13 weeks of the child's birth. However, there is no backdating provision for people who adopt older, rather than newborn, children. These people may be paid only from the date of claim. This bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 so that arrears of family payment may be paid from the date a child enters an adoptive parent's care if the claim is lodged within 13 weeks of the date the child is placed in the person's care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently, when a person who is receiving family payment for one or more children takes on the care of a new child, whether by birth or adoption, it is unnecessary for the person to lodge a new claim for the new child. It is sufficient to notify the department of the addition to the family for the increased rate to be paid. However, there is currently no rule allowing the increased rate to be backdated to the new child's birth or the date the new child came into the person's care. Accordingly, the rate may be increased only from the first family payment payday after the actual birth or the date the new child came into the person's care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes amendments to allow rate increases for second and subsequent family payment children to be backdated if the department is notified of the birth of the second or subsequent child within 13 weeks of the birth or the date the child came into the person's care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional family payment rates applicable to children under the age of 16 are adjusted each year on 1 January so that the sum of the combined basic family payment and additional family payment does not fall below a certain percentage&mdash;benchmarks of adequacy&mdash;of the combined pensioner couple maximum basic rate. From 1 January 1995, additional family payment rates applicable to children under the age of 16 were increased by $1 per week as a result of a decision taken in the 1993-94 budget context. To preserve the benefit of the $1 increase, this bill changes the current level of benchmarks of adequacy so that the increased rates of additional family payment are reflected in the benchmarks. Therefore, from 1 January 1996, additional family payment rates will increase in line with the higher benchmarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sole parent pension is currently available to people bringing up children on their own, in a number of situations. People may qualify if they are not members of a couple, or, if they are members of a couple but living separately and apart from their partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill ensures that people who are separated may qualify only if that separation is permanent or indefinite, and not if it is a strictly temporary separation. The sole parent pension is designed to provide medium- to long-term support for people faced with the responsibility of bringing up children on their own. It is not intended to be available to people separated from their partners due to holidays, work or study commitments or during short-term domestic disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also introduces special measures to assist those people in our community caring for disabled relatives or friends. One measure concerns the current inconsistency that frail disabled people may travel overseas for a holiday without their own social security entitlement being affected, whereas their carer may not accompany them because the carer pension is generally not portable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment allows a carer pensioner to accompany the person being cared for overseas without loss of qualification, provided that the period of absence is temporary and does not exceed three months. This will permit disabled people to retain the support of their carer while travelling overseas to visit their homeland, for example, or to seek medical treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since July 1993, carer pensioners have been entitled to participate in employment or education and training within the limitations imposed by their caring role. However, while long-term recipients of many social security payments are entitled to an employment entry payment to assist with the costs of starting employment and are entitled to an education entry payment to assist with the costs of taking up study, these entitlements have not been available to carer pensioners. This bill introduces an employment entry payment of $100 and an education entry payment of $200 for carer pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also introduces measures to assist people claiming the sickness allowance. The requirement to serve an ordinary waiting period is removed if the social security secretary is satisfied that it will cause the person severe financial hardship. A similar rule already applies to people who claim the jobsearch and newstart allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mobility allowance is provided to assist with transport costs incurred by disabled people. It is generally payable to handicapped people who are in gainful employment, vocational training, voluntary work or certain approved jobsearch activities. Disabled recipients of jobsearch, newstart or the youth training allowance are necessarily engaged in jobsearch activities, yet they have not had access to mobility allowance for technical reasons. This bill ensures that these people will have access to mobility allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1993, an amendment to the Social Security Act 1991 extended the availability of fringe benefits to all disability support pensioners, regardless of income, for 12 months after their payments ceased. However, the continuation of fringe benefits was unintentionally restricted to pensioners who lose their qualification because they commence full-time work. It does not extend to those whose pension is cancelled because of their earnings but who do not commence full-time work. The dependent pensioner partners&mdash;that is, the wife or carer pensioners&mdash;of these disability support pensioners also lose their entitlement to a fringe benefit extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments made by this bill allow clients whose disability support pension is cancelled because of their earnings&mdash;whether from full-time work or not&mdash;to retain their eligibility for fringe benefits for 12 months. Currently, disability support pensioners who lose qualification as a result of commencing full-time work may have their pensions suspended&mdash;for two years&mdash;rather than cancelled. Should they again become qualified for disability support pension during that two-year period, an accelerated restoration process replaces the need for a new claim. This provision, introduced as part of the disability reform package, was designed to serve as an incentive for clients to attempt employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, however, pensioners whose disability support pensions are cancelled because of their earnings from part-time work would have their pensions cancelled upon expiry of any earnings credit. Such people would have to undergo a new claim assessment process if they again become eligible for pension. As a result, a disincentive exists for people to attempt part-time work, which is the only option available to many disability support pensioners. This is contrary to the spirit of the disability reform package. This bill applies the two-year suspension rule to all persons whose disability support pensions cease because of their earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Partner allowance commenced in September 1994 as a direct payment to the dependent partner of a recipient of jobsearch, newstart or sickness allowance or special benefit. The payment had previously been made as an add-on to the rate paid to the allowance or benefit recipient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, partner allowance may only be paid 14 days in arrears. This may disadvantage some people in some cases if a person's partner is granted jobsearch, newstart or sickness allowance or special benefit more than 14 days before the lodgment of a claim for partner allowance. To address this problem the bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 so that partner allowance may be backdated to the date the person's partner claims jobsearch, newstart or sickness allowance or special benefit provided the claim for partner allowance is made within 14 days of the partner's claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes a number of amendments to the jobsearch and newstart programs. Specifically, the bill allows the social security secretary the option of requiring a person to attend a particular place for a particular purpose as a condition of payment of jobsearch or newstart allowance. This option will be exercised in situations where, for example, the secretary considers that a particular program information session held outside DSS and the CES would be valuable for the person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also amends provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 relating to the appropriation of money, from which jobsearch and newstart training supplements are paid, to more accurately reflect the source of those funds. Entitlement to the supplement is contingent on approval of participation in a vocational training program or labour market program by the employment secretary. This approval is not subject to review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes a number of amendments to simplify, and make more equitable, the cancellation and debt recovery provisions of the Social Security Act 1991. Certain provisions operate to create a debt when a person receives a payment that is calculated at a rate greater than the correct maximum payment rate. This applies whether or not the person notified the department of a change in circumstances, and the debt commences from the date of the relevant event or change in circumstances. As the debt incurred will be the same whether or not the department is advised, this acts as a disincentive for people to notify the department of changes in circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To provide an incentive for social security recipients to notify promptly changes in circumstances, and to ensure that treatment is consistent with the treatment of other recipients who notify changes resulting in loss of qualification, this bill ensures that recipients who notify a change in circumstances that affects the maximum payment rate will incur a debt only from the end of the notification period. This allows them a period of grace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current legislation, there is a clear distinction between qualification and payability for a social security payment. The general scheme of the Social Security Act 1991 is that payment is no longer payable to a person who loses qualification for it. However, the debt recovery provisions are not as clear on this point as they might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 to ensure that, once a social security recipient has lost qualification, the recipient will have no further entitlement to payments. This proposal does not disturb the current rules that allow for the continuation of payment to the end of the notification period. Rather, it provides an incentive for clients to notify a change in circumstances within the prescribed period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time since the bill was introduced, further examination of the debt recovery provisions contained in the bill has revealed that it is possible that certain provisions may not in fact operate as originally intended. That being the case, I will be moving amendments to the bill that will operate to remove any doubt on this matter and will ensure that the original intention of the provisions is put into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are an estimated 170 local exchange trading systems or similar community exchange programs in existence nationally, the largest with 1,500 members. As goods and services are exchanged without recourse to money, these systems are a useful community initiative, particularly in representing a form of activity that helps social security recipients keep contact with labour market skills and habits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, goods and services provided in return for non-cash credits are assessed as income for the purposes of the income test in the Social Security Act 1991, which discourages participation in these schemes. This bill exempts certain non-cash credits from the income test to overcome this disincentive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 to allow notice of a decision to be given to a person for the purposes of the act if that notice is sent by pre-paid post to a person's post office box last known to the secretary. This amendment clarifies the department's response to a number of Federal Court decisions. This bill also makes amendments to the National Health Act 1953 and the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be moving amendments to the bill that will allow the Minister for Social Security to declare, by notice in writing and published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, a particular class of debt that may be waived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment recognises the development of a data matching program between the Department of Social Security and the Australian Taxation Office's reportable payments system-RPS&mdash;in relation to the incomes of non-PAYE taxpayers. The government amendment will enable particular classes of debts arising under the principal act to be waived for those who would be affected by the new data matching program and who volunteer advice to the Department of Social Security about their true circumstances. I will also be moving amendments to omit division 7 of the bill. That division deals with interview requirements for sole parent pension and bereavement allowance claimants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 20 March 1995, a new payment type, income support supplement, will be introduced into the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The arrangements for carer pension need to take into account the introduction of income support supplement. Unless the carer pension provisions are amended, carer pensioners will lose qualification for carer pension if they care for a person who receives an income support supplement instead of a social security payment. I will therefore be moving amendments that deal with various carer pension provisions to ensure that carer pensioners are not disadvantaged by the introduction of the income support supplement. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is a very interesting bill. When the listing of the bill was discussed for debate, it was suggested that the bill be referred to the Main Committee. I was told that it contained largely matters of form, matters of a minor and inconsequential nature and matters of a rather superficial character which would not raise or excite any particular interest of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes I think bills of this character need an even more comprehensive review, and I have a suggestion on the way in which this matter might be progressed. I foreshadow that, unless the government is mindful to give the responsibilities to a committee of this House, we will once more ask the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee to examine a number of matters which I will identify. I believe amendments will be required for each of those matters. I will suggest a way in which the matter might be progressed satisfactorily to achieve an outcome that will meet the government's objectives and the concerns that I and others have raised. I will propose specifically one amendment to deal with an oversight in some legislation handled late last year in which all of the agreed amendments were not put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be recognised that these days social security legislation is extraordinarily complex. When we look at the advisers sitting over there and when we turn our eyes to the desk we can see probably what are meant to be rather plain English legislative guides that rise to something of the order of eight inches above the desk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like tax law, social security law has become very complex indeed. But, as a measure of the cooperation that the government obtains from the opposition, I will at first instance mention the large number of issues that are covered in this legislation that will not be the subject of significant adverse comment or amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These proposals are intended to modify the carer pensioner provisions for a person accompanying the carer overseas: that is, carers would be able to obtain the benefit of their pension while they accompany a person who is otherwise entitled to go overseas. The financial consequences of that are not regarded as significant, but it has been drawn to my attention that there are others who may become entitled to this particular benefit. While the government expects that only 10 or so cases might occur at this time, with the way in which pension payments are increasingly changing and with the greater likelihood with the introduction of the partner allowance that many more people will go onto carers' pensions, we should not be surprised if this has more significant financial implications over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the welfare rights movement has also suggested some extensions of this area. No doubt the government would look at those matters in a budget context but, knowing of the ease with which it is considering social security expenditures in the context of this budget, I would not be too optimistic about significant further extensions at this time. But that matter has been raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also sought to extend employment entry payments to carer pensioners. An education payment for carer pensioners is provided. While we are not opposing that matter, I observe that I sought some further information from the department which has not come to me at this time. That would normally prompt me to be more difficult about the matter. In relation to carers who have to provide constant care and attention, and with the definitions of what constitutes constant care and attention, how can we be providing access to carer pensioners to involve themselves in other work or other studies for up to 10 hours a week when we are going to give them a $100 entry payment on the one hand or an education entry payment of $200 on the other hand? They are meant to be offering constant care and attention. It may be that constant care and attention is not constant care and attention under the definitions that we use. I had hoped that that matter would be clarified for me, but I have not seen any clarification. But, in my usual cooperative way, I am not allowing that matter to affect my judgment in the extent to which I facilitate the passage of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill deals with other matters as well. It extends the suspension provisions to disability support pensioners when the DSP is cancelled because of earnings. It allows certain DSP recipients to retain eligibility for fringe benefits. It allows recipients of jobsearch and newstart allowances and the youth training allowance to receive a mobility allowance. It ensures that the partner allowance is payable from the same date as other allowances under certain circumstances. It will increase the additional family payment benchmark effective from 1 January 1996. It will allow retrospective family payment arrears and increases to be paid in certain circumstances. It will remove the need to determine whether a particular loan is exempt or not. It will remove the requirement for a waiting period before sickness allowance can be paid in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will provide that the training supplement is payable only if the training course undertaken has approval of the employment secretary. It will expand the circumstances in which notices of decision are taken to be given to a person. It will ensure that a person is taken to have failed to negotiate an activity agreement if the secretary is satisfied that the person is reasonably delaying an agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will reduce rates of payment of certain allowances from certain dates when a customer with an earnings credit balance fails to notify receipt of that income that could result in a decreased allowance payment. It will clarify that ministerial decisions under sections 1099E and 1099L are not subject to internal or Social Security Appeals Tribunal review. It will exempt specified exchange trading agreements from the income test provisions. It will simplify the continuation and variation of determinations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will make minor and technical amendments to the National Health Act to enable certain persons who receive a mature age allowance to retain eligibility for Commonwealth fringe benefits and will preserve the health care card entitlement for certain mobility allowances. It also deals with certain data matching issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not intending to raise substantial objections to any of those matters. It is an extraordinarily beneficial approach to take on legislation dealing with such a large number of matters&mdash;and I commend the advisers on getting so many matters right on this occasion&mdash;but it does reflect upon the nature of the Social Security Act when, in order to make non-budget measure changes, so many issues have to be addressed. I approach examination of these issues seriously. You wonder how any customer or client can reasonably expect to find their way through this legislation. This is a matter that is going to require review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was at a conference recently in which the welfare rights movement took us through particular client examples, which revealed the enormous difficulty in properly advising people as to their entitlements. Because of the extent to which the government wants, in many cases, to put its own mark on the Social Security Act and to have programs with names that it can say it is responsible for, it has unnecessarily, in my view, introduced complexity of such an order that it puts customers and clients in enormous difficulty in being able to satisfy themselves as to their entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now go to the six or so matters that I did not mention. The first relates to the issue of ensuring that the sole parent pension is payable only if the separation is permanent or indefinite. The government gave us some advice as to some problems it sees in this matter. I am told they are largely potential at the moment, and that is why we are told in the explanatory memorandum that the revenue could leach to some $30 million, presumably if people took advantage of what one might assume were loopholes in the existing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible for people to separate but for the separation to be for a purpose. It could be that a partner has gone overseas or interstate to work or to study, leaving the partner at home. Nobody would envisage that a person in those circumstances would be able to have their spouse or partner on a sole parent pension, particularly if they are up on the North West Shelf working at great danger on an oil derrick pulling in $60,000 or $70,000 a year. That is possible, but nobody would expect the act to provide a sole parent pension in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other matters that were raised in relation to the extent to which people in a relationship might temporarily separate. The issue arises as to whether or not&mdash;if that separation is clearly of a temporary character and the parties are going to come back together again&mdash;it is reasonable to allow a sole parent pension to be payable in those circumstances. This is where we do see very significant problems arising in relation to what happens in those instances where a spouse has left a violent partner for a temporary reason. Sometimes, when you look back at the relationship, it is very easy to make a judgment that the separation was temporary and make a determination on the basis that the parties have come back together again. But, in situations in which people are faced with some violent action which could occasion them to separate, there are difficult judgments that have to be made at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has suggested that the act presently provides more than sufficient discretion for those who are examining these matters to be able to make a definitive judgment as to whether or not a sole parent pension claimant has left because of the violent actions of the `other member of a couple'&mdash;these are the formal terms that are used&mdash;and that the claimant would not be forced, through lack of financial support, to return home to a dangerous situation. However, the fact is that a number of organisations have raised very real concern about this issue, including the welfare rights movement. Although it has been put to me that this body may not understand fully the framework of law that operates in this area, it has usually been my experience that it has a pretty good knowledge of these matters. The welfare rights movement is very concerned about this question, as is the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, which has raised exactly the same question as to what happens in cases where violence, in particular, might be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have suggested to the department that, if there is any ambiguity about these provisions, there may well be other examples in other areas of the law, whereby claims of domestic violence by a partner are examined by an organisation that would normally hear from both sides and establish that the claims had been proven. In the area of immigration, this is done in relation to claims for grant of resident status, where a partner separates because of domestic violence. The government wants to be satisfied that there is a proper basis upon which a grant of residence status might be made in compassionate circumstances. This avoids double jeopardy, whereby a person loses their partner and then may be forced to leave Australia as well. The fact that the domestic violence was proven was accepted under that law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that the provisions that have been used in immigration law could be used in this area to provide a basis for partners who had been the subject of domestic violence proceedings. Such provisions could be accepted as the method by which it could be proven that a couple had separated for just cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that those matters do need to have a good deal more attention. That can be undertaken in the context of a committee examination, where the views put by the welfare rights movement can be laid on the table, as can the departmental view that these matters are already addressed. We can then develop further amendments, perhaps along the lines that I have suggested, or with the department's assistance. But these matters do need further attention. Certainly, we do not want to see the revenue leaching. People should not be able to obtain benefits because of an artificial separation, but they should be able to do so in cases where domestic violence is involved. I am sure my colleague the member for Pearce (Ms Moylan), who takes a very considerable interest in questions relating to women, would be concerned if I were not to put this matter clearly on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter that I wish to raise is the requirement that claimants for a sole parent pension or bereavement allowance attend an interview relating to that claim. This matter was raised by other organisations, particularly the welfare rights groups. The concern is that the requirement of notice suggested could be a period of less than 14 days in which a person would be required to attend an interview. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security says that the government is going to take that matter out. It was a matter of concern to me. I know it was raised with the government. It shows the way in which these matters can be responsibly addressed. I welcome that comment. It demonstrates the benefits that can be obtained from a thoroughgoing review of legislation when it is presented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter of concern was the provision to allow the Secretary to the Department of Social Security to require a jobsearch or newstart allowance recipient to attend a particular place for a specified purpose. This is a particularly interesting matter because the government is already able to designate whether a particular program meets the government's training requirements. It now wants to designate whether or not a particular jobsearch or newstart training participant is able to participate in that particular approved program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordinarily, one would think that a judgment ought to be able to be made as to whether a particular individual should participate in a program, and whether the particular program suits that person. A determination could then be made that, even though a case manager has suggested it, the department is able to come to another view. If the clause is enacted in the form that is proposed, it would be listed in the non-reviewable decisions under section 1250 of the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a matter of concern to us. There is a vast difference between approval of a general course as a suitable vocational training or labour market program and the decision that a particular course will not assist a particular person to find work. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills made the following observation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pending the minister's advice, the committee draws attention to the provision, as it may be considered to make rights and liberties or obligations unduly dependent upon a non-reviewable decision in breach of principle 1A(3) of the committee's terms of reference. And the committee draws Senators' attention to the provisions that may be considered to make rights and liberties and obligations unduly dependent on insufficiently defined administrative powers in breach of principle 1A(2) of the committee's terms of reference, or, in the alternative, to make the exercise of legislative power insufficiently subject to parliamentary scrutiny in breach of principle 1A(5) of the committee's terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA>Given those comments, the opposition is mindful to oppose that particular measure in another place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the fourth matter, the issue is to allow customer information to be disclosed to certain Commonwealth agencies. The government is seeking to change the provisions by which information is presently made available to other Commonwealth departments and authorities. There are a number of provisions that operate in this area. I have had a briefing in relation to those. The one that we are dealing with here is to allow the Secretary to the Department of Social Security to disclose information not to the secretary of another Commonwealth department or authority&mdash;which is the present arrangement&mdash;but to other staff of that Commonwealth department or authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are certain circumstances under certain provisions where that can happen now, but this provision is designed to extend the range. At the moment it is intended that that will be done by way of the secretary delegating his or her disclosure power. My concern is that that then takes it beyond the scrutiny of this parliament as to how far that delegation may go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did raise this concern and I have received formal advice from the department&mdash;for which I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security&mdash;which details the nature of the way in which these matters are dealt with. It is quite clear the particular way in which this matter is to be dealt with. Advice from the Attorney-General's Department is that this delegation is an instrument of an administrative character and only instruments of a legislative character are suitable for disallowable instrument status. The department, therefore, is arguing that even under the new Legislative Instruments Act this delegation would be administrative and would not be reviewable under that legislation, and so what we will be seeking in another place in relation to that matter is that this delegation be clearly a delegation that is subject to parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to the decision to allow the secretary to collect information relating to claims for the seniors health card. There was an interesting matter raised with me by the Council for the Ageing, which wanted to be assured that when, in relation to the issue of the seniors health card, the department was going to obtain information from a third party relevant to whether or not a person who has claimed is qualified for that card, the information that is obtained from that third party will be provided to the claimants so that they could at least test its veracity. That to me seems not an unreasonable request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that that issue can be addressed already under freedom of information law and it may be sufficiently covered that the third party information would be disclosable to the claimant. I am not yet satisfied that that is the case. I think that is a matter that the committee ought to review, where the evidence can be laid on the table and we can satisfy ourselves in relation to that matter. If there are no requirements at the moment which would ensure that that occurs, it seems to me that in that instance we do need to ensure that the freedom of information provisions are extended to cover it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the last matter relating to the question of debts and waiver. As the parliamentary secretary mentioned in her speech, this area is one in which the government itself will be proposing amendments and it is quite complex and difficult. I just want to make one observation first of all about another area in which the welfare rights movement has satisfied me that we ought not to accommodate one of the particular changes that the government is pressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the situation, as I understand it, is that when the issue of debt recovery arises there are two issues that are involved: first, the issue of whether or not a person is qualified for a particular benefit; and, at a point when that qualification issue arises, there is a basis upon which a debt can arise if a further decision is taken which is a separate decision relating to the question of whether the benefit was properly payable. So you have got two issues, one of qualification and the second of payability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's proposals, as we are advised, bring these two concepts together, so the judgment will be made as to when a debt arises on the basis of whether or not the person was qualified for the particular benefit, and that may involve an element of backdating. It means that the time when somebody becomes aware and says that a person was no longer eligible is not the time at which the debt is created&mdash;it is in fact backdated, in some cases presumably to the date when the person no longer qualified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the difficulty with this matter is that, if this backdating is allowed to the date at which the person was no longer qualified, a certain laxity is allowed to develop in the administration. It means that nobody has to be conscious that there is a penalty that the department suffers, the revenue suffers, if somebody is not making the decision that the person is no longer payable. It means that people might even be encouraged in the view that they can let the matter go on and not draw it to attention&mdash;in a situation in which there may be pressure to do other work, for instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department has had a lot of problems in prioritising its work lately and the whole question of payability, of ascertaining whether somebody ought not to have been on a benefit and making a decision as to whether or not to terminate payment, could be deferred because it is not a priority task. That seems to me to be disadvantaging the person who is involved, who is going to have a debt created and to be obliged, through deductions that will occur later, to make a repayment. I am not convinced in relation to that matter. There needs to be an examination by the committee in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter is that of waiver. The government wants to introduce specific provisions in relation to waiver of debts to introduce new data matching provisions. We are quite happy with the government's intentions in that regard but we want to see the circumstances in which that is done. There are delegations proposed here which we think need to be the subject of parliamentary review. We want that matter to be examined in the Senate committee as well and would propose amendments in the Senate to ensure that that happened if the present legislation that deals with delegated instruments did not cover it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, this bill does give us an opportunity to amend the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Act of last year and section 1251 of the Social Security Act. I will be moving that amendment in the consideration in detail stage because of the situation in which that oversight was not addressed on the previous occasion. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 consists essentially of some 27 non-controversial items.

It means that I will not have to go through my standard speech of rebuttal. I am delighted also to hear that we have entered a new era of cooperation&mdash;exciting news for us. It does not change anything, because all we have had in the past has been rhetoric and empty words, but this new bit of cooperation may mean that we will get some more constructive discussion and debate. At the same time we may not prolong what in many cases are relatively minor matters and turn them into political point scoring matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters are essentially non-controversial. Of the 27 items that are listed in the explanatory memorandums, one major one has an impact financially. That is the additional family payment benchmark, which will affect next year's budget by $46 million, up to $99 million in 1997-98. With regard to the remainder of the amendments, the effect is negligible&mdash;in one case $0.2 million, in another case $0.53 million. The case that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) referred to, the qualification for sole parent, has a potential cost to budget of some $30 million but at the moment that figure is not costed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially they are matters of housekeeping, of modification, of tidying up and in many cases of basically adjusting equity, and in that context it is important that matters like the treatment of carers' pensions are actually brought into line. Matters like the extension of family payments in adoption cases to make them equivalent for older adoptions are fairly straightforward matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) has indicated some proposed changes to be made by the government on these matters. I note particularly the one for a veteran whose carers may be disqualified from a carer's allowance if all the veteran is receiving is compensation as opposed to a pension. That obviously is an important matter. These types of matters will come up in each parliament as the world changes. For example, when the government in the 1990 budget phased out the first home ownership scheme, there was a downstream consequential requirement to remove the provision for that scheme from the data collection and to adjust the relationship between the Department of Social Security and the department of housing. These are the kinds of matters that one normally deals with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 12 years we have seen a major reshaping of the social security system. Whatever we do, there will be people who will have different views, and that is an understandable situation in a country like ours. But it is important to understand that our system is not a middle-class welfare system; it is incredibly well targeted. Today's amendments actually finetune that targeting. The focus is on finetuning and adjusting and bringing up to date. There must be constant vigilance for possible loopholes, like the sole parents who could choose to live in separate houses and, notionally, still get full allowances, unlike a couple who were living in the same house. Those kinds of things will come up from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the linkages and the targeting in terms of income levels and distribution of support, and if one then looks at the linkages between the social security system and other systems such as the employment and training system, Austudy and a whole range of other areas, which we need to bring together very closely, one will see that it is an incredibly complex system. There is no doubt about that. It is complex due to the sheer diversity of people, their families and their circumstances. A sophisticated system is needed to handle that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister, the member for Berowra, spoke about eight inches of files on the advisers' desks. That is relatively minor in one sense. You can call it complex or you can call it sophisticated. The fact is that, if you want to have a sophisticated system&mdash;and I am sure Australians do&mdash;sophistication requires definition. You simply cannot have a sophisticated system across the range of issues that we have and expect to get the interrelationships within and between systems right unless they are well defined. Eventually it is the legislation that provides the definitive framework and eventually it is regulations that extend that into detailed applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the idea that having complex legislation is somehow a bad thing is fallacious. Complex issues are not simplistic. You can define them, you can describe them simply, but to make them simplistic is to remove their sophistication. There is a class of politicians around this country, and in other parts of the world, who keep telling people there are simplistic solutions to complex problems. There aren't; there never were and there never will be. There may be simple explanations of complex matters, but what we hear is much more to do with the simplistic, and I think many Australians now understand that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have, in fact, moved more and more towards a sophisticated, targeted and interrelated system. That was nowhere more evident than in the Working Nation white paper of last year. I can recall, from when I first entered parliament, the separation between the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the old CES. I will just give you an example of that separation, from my own area. Back in about 1985 or 1986, we required the two departments to compare their files on those people who were registered for unemployment and those people receiving social security benefits. When that comparison was made, it was discovered that something like 18 per cent of the people who were receiving unemployment benefits were not registered for employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the system that we inherited. That was the system that Liberal and National Party members had put in place and had run for my lifetime. It was a system that did not require cross-referencing or interrelationships. The mood we have had in recent years has been a difficult thing to achieve. It has required a substantial cultural change within the departments themselves, and it has required incredibly sophisticated machinery of government between the departments in order for them to actually cross-refer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider the amendment that was raised by the shadow minister, regarding the transfer of information between secretary and secretary, and whether that should be passed down the line. I can understand, as we all can, the concerns about the level at which we authorise staff to transfer private information about individual clients of their departments. But the idea that we let only secretaries talk to each other is, obviously, foolish. Given the level of information that is available or is needed, the number of people who are served by each department and the potential for fraudulence, to limit that to such a narrow bottleneck would mean that the amount of information passed would be so minimal that it would totally hamper both the departments and the government in terms of our efforts to make sure our systems are used fairly and properly. That is the kind of level of sophistication we need, and I am quite confident that the minister and the departments can set an appropriate level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, of course, we must accept and remember that whatever level is chosen must be backed up by the provisions of the privacy legislation and a range of other matters. Certainly, our departmental staff are human beings; they are as capable of being corrupt as some others in the community may be. But our provisions on those matters are, in fact, extremely powerful. I am quite confident that the misuse of that information would be an absolute exception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the need for good relationships between those departments relies on good information transfer, as do our fraud prevention measures and our cross-referencing, because, in many cases, people do get into situations which are not of their own making. I have constituents, as we all do, who come in, having discovered that they have debts they were not aware of and did not know were building up. In many cases, what we are doing, by both data matching and better departmental communication, is preventing people getting into situations of having to repay, out of their benefits, debts inadvertently incurred. So, good communication between departments, in very many cases, is in the interests of the people we and those departments serve. It is an indication of the level of sophistication that we have developed between our departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attempts by those opposite to suggest that there is a lot of fat available in the social security budget, and that we can cut massive amounts out of it and, at the same time, in most cases, oppose any measures to minimise fraud or tighten up the system, I have always found to be interesting. It is obvious from the figures coming through in recent times, particularly with data matching and so on, that the government's measures in terms of fraud and sustaining integrity, introduced some years ago, are becoming increasingly effective. The level of fraud is now a minor part of expenditure, and well within international norms and parameters. What must be remembered is that those measures were all new. The things that we have been doing in recent years were unheard of 12 years ago, when the departments were not even required to talk to each other or to cross-reference each other's applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may also be political mileage for those opposite in attempting to create a climate of blaming the victims, of blaming those on benefits for their circumstances, of redeveloping a new mentality based on the concept of dole bludgers. There may be some political mileage in that, given that people on benefits are effectively a minority in the community. But what those opposite are doing in that process will not be to their ultimate benefit. The concept of scapegoating and blaming the unemployed and other people on social security systems is implicit in their comments about the level of fraud but, more importantly, in comments on the capacity to cut the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That concept came through in a recent public opinion survey that suggested a majority of people thought that the way for a government to save money was in the welfare area. That was not by accident; that did not come out of the blue. People did not suddenly have a dream and suddenly realise what they believed. It has been a long process of conditioning by those opposite who have been suggesting for many years now that there were massive savings available in the welfare budget. That `throwing enough mud' methodology is clearly having an effect, and the tragedy of that is that those who are impacted by it and those who are made to feel guilt about the fact that they are on social security cannot fight back and cannot answer back. At the same time, they know, as we and those opposite know, that the measures in place to protect the integrity of the system are quite profound. I suppose it is the hypocrisy of that that makes me angry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my constituents' point of view, on the one hand people come forward quite upset about the level of antifraud measures that are in place, the number of checks that are done and the amount of reporting that people have to do in terms of response while, at the same time, they are being seen by the broader community as bludgers. That is the kind of resentment that is being built up in people who really are victims of circumstances rather than otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In every parliament there will be legislation of this nature: omnibus amendments which pick up a whole range of issues. Normally, we would deal with them in a fairly prompt fashion and I trust that that will be the case after hearing the shadow minister, this being a new year and this being the first legislation of the current year. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one hand, we hear of cooperation on this legislation and then we have this kind of childish game playing, which is probably the appropriate description for the call from the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) for a quorum. He sees the whole parliament as a joke. He is also one of those who will join in this constant theme about the standing and status of the parliament. Perhaps he joins the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) in warning teenagers not to come here, but he is the reason that they should not come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a series of minor amendments which are essentially non-controversial. I am interested in the shadow minister's comments&mdash;most of which, quite frankly, I see as looking for a reason to argue against it, rather than being very constructive. The fact that we are constantly revising and reviewing, trying to make things clearer and easier to understand and administer, and increasing our level of sophistication within and between departments, is an indication of why our welfare support system is seen as one of the world's finest, and probably the most effective. I commend the amendments to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join this debate on the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 to support my colleague the shadow minister, the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who is one of the most compassionate people in this place. I am also interested to listen to my colleagues from the other side of the House who are quite conscientious and intelligent. I am interested in the way they keep extending the myth about the Labor Party and their thoughts about the social system of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that we, as a wealthy country, should be supporting those that are needy, and I guess that in Australia we do. But the myths that surround the Labor Party keep coming through with every speaker. The last speaker, the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), talked about cultural change and constantly revising things, and about how we on this side were blaming people on social security as victims and calling them bludgers. I have never actually heard anyone on this side call them bludgers, but I do remember the member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith), in a speech in this place 12 months or maybe two years ago, mentioned that retired Australians are, in fact, spongers on the system. So the only people I have actually heard criticise people who are on social security are those on the other side of the House. The myth really continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind those government members here of the promises that they made about social security, as well&mdash;promises that they are constantly revising and changing. The Australian Labor Party's 1993 election policies for older Australians said that they would remove all age and service pensioners from the tax system by 1995. That was a promise at the last election. I guess that must be happening some time this year. I believe the former Treasurer, John Dawkins, said that he was not compelled to keep that promise, but he is no longer here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular social security legislation is very important to Australia. We have got to look after our fellow Australians. In this particular area, we spend $68,000 per minute, 24 hours per day in Australia. You would expect that, if we are spending $68,000 per minute, we would in fact get some value for money, rather than eight inches thick of regulation on how we should be spending this money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest difference I find between Labor politicians and Liberal politicians is that, while they are all conscientious and very much wanting to support each other and Australians, the Labor Party members have no concept of where money comes from. They do not know how to handle money: they spend it all over the place, as you can see they did in Western Australian, South Australian and Victorian state governments. Labor just throws money at a problem, rather than trying to actually get in and solve the problem in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he first came into the parliament the previous speaker mentioned comparisons of unemployed people in Australia. I have a table that I want to refer to. In the year 1982-83, which was when the Labor Party came into power, unemployment in Australia was nine per cent, with 624,900 actually unemployed and those getting benefits numbering 545,300. He was quite right to suggest that there were fewer people getting benefits than were unemployed. In 1993-94, some 10 years later, there were 915,500 people unemployed, yet, strangely enough, there were 917,500 people actually getting unemployed benefits. So we have gone from one extreme where there were actually more people unemployed not getting the benefit 10 years ago to now when people are receiving the benefit who perhaps should not be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This table is interesting because it gives an average duration of unemployment back in 1982-83 of 32.9 weeks. Some 10 years later, the average duration of unemployment is 57.5 weeks. So I guess there has been a lot of constant revising and change in the last 10 years. Whether it is for the better or not is something for Australians to consider at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker also talks about some of the great things that the Labor Party has achieved, which again is myth making, but I would like to read a couple of things that it has achieved. Over the last 11 years, one in 10 Australian families has both parents out of work; almost 19 per cent, 704,000, of Australia's children aged under 15 live in a family with no breadwinner; and one quarter, 25 per cent, of Australian families has no working member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year was the International Year of the Family, and one quarter of Australian families has no working member. This is what the Labor Party has delivered to us. The number of traditional families in the category of unemployed and welfare dependent rose by 50 per cent from 1989 to 1993. The number of children who are members of families dependent upon social security payments rose from 619,000 or thereabouts in 1982 to almost 1.6 million in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One in eight families is falling below the poverty line. Poverty is increasing in almost every group except the aged. Over two million Australians now live below the poverty line. In a country as wealthy as Australia, two million of our fellow Australians live below the poverty line. That equates to 13 per cent of households and a rise of over 14 per cent of the population since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>Of all Australians living in poverty, one half come from traditional nuclear families. Forty-four per cent of Australia's single-parent families live in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking inflation into account, 10 per cent of earners have seen their income rise by seven per cent since Labor took office. Over the same period, real wages for the bottom 10 per cent have fallen by five per cent. The top 20 per cent of income earners get 42.1 per cent of total earnings; the bottom 20 per cent get 5.4 per cent. So these are the real facts about the Labor Party in power as opposed to the great myth about its being the carers of Australia. It does not really care; it just throws money at a problem and hopes it solves itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill is full of amendments. Why are we putting amendments through? It is because, traditionally, the Australian Labor Party cannot get these things right. We are always amending bills. Remember the great Native Title Bill that came through about 18 months ago? Apparently, it now requires amendments and will be coming back into the House some time this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no intention of opposing this social security bill, as the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), said. We support most of the amendments. However, it must be said that the area of social security is very complex and it is too bureaucratic. I have seen examples of that in my own electorate. This particular amendment deals with debt collection. If the debt collection system in social security is like it is in other agencies associated with government, people will be interested in a story presented to me recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A young woman aged 19, who had left school at 16, had been working for 2 1/2 years to save enough money to educate herself in a particular course. That course cost her $5,000 for 12 months. She applied for and was granted Austudy because it was an Austudy approved course. At that time her father was only on part-time employment. For 2 1/2 years she had been earning her salary and had been independent of her parents. Despite that, when her father went from a part-time job to a full-time job, her Austudy payments were affected. I do not understand why someone who had been independent of her family had her Austudy payments affected when another member of the family had a wage increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The girl was not advised about this until December, and her repayments were backdated to October. It was something like $350-odd. She could not afford to pay it immediately. The people from the department harassed her. They harangued her. They rang her constantly. She offered to pay at the end of the course when she was employed, as people do with the HEC scheme. They would not accept that. They said that she had to pay the money back right away. She offered to pay it off at $5 a month. They accepted that. They were very pleased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the day after they accepted that offer, she received another letter demanding payment within seven days. That caused her great angst and caused the family to come to me. The problem was that the person she was dealing with in the department went on holidays. The new person who replaced that person the next day demanded a payment because he did not know what was going on. This story shows that the whole thing is getting too bureaucratic. Social security is a human area. It requires a humane approach. We are dealing with people; we are not dealing with machines. This particular department is getting so complex and so bureaucratic that one wonders what it is employed to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of this amendment relates to activity and attendance requirements for unemployed people. This means that if someone does not comply with the performance contract, as people are required to do after about 18 months of unemployment&mdash;and we know that 57 weeks was the average length of unemployment during 1993-94&mdash;that person will lose his benefits. Part of that employment contract is an attendance requirement. We assume that this is not going to be treated with disdain and that people will not be forced to do unreasonable things. For example, if a person is living in Manly, New South Wales, and the person in Manly says, `There is a job in Wollongong. You are required to attend,' and that person does not attend, could he lose his benefits? That is an extreme case, but if people do not fulfil activity or attendance requirements, they could lose their benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party put forward the myth that we on this side were dropping people off the dole. This is exactly what the government is now doing. If someone is required to attend or do an activity and refuses to do that, based upon whatever grounds, they in fact lose their benefits. So the bottom line is that those who do not want to comply with their performance agreement lose their benefits. That means the government is dropping people off the system. So the notion from the Labor Party that this applies to our side of politics is in fact true for its side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the comments my colleague the member for Berowra made earlier, and I will finish this by saying that we are a wealthy country. We have some rich resources and some great natural talent. One of our greatest natural talents is our people, and we do not necessarily look after our people as well as we could. Sure, we try to help by giving them money when they are needy and require some help, but the problem is greater than that. What is required is not just throwing money at the problem&mdash;we must actually go into the whole social system and look at the basic problems, why people are needing to go on welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing with people; we are not dealing with machines. The more complex this legislation for social security becomes, the more complex it is for those conscientious officers that work for the Department of Social Security and the more hassles they have, because it is harder for them to understand. It really is time that we started taking a bipartisan approach to this whole problem and not taking people for granted, as I think we sometimes do, certainly in the broader public debate. As my colleague was saying, it is time that we started treating these issues of people on welfare as important issues and not necessarily throw money at the problem but in fact seek solutions as to why they are on welfare in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is really what we should be doing in this place, rather than bickering over amounts and what we should be doing about money here and money there. It is really time we started facing the facts about our social system in Australia and started doing something about it. Just making amendments here and then shifting things here and disqualifying some people and allowing people over here is not really the way to go. We should be looking at the whole social problem and looking at other policies&mdash;perhaps not in social security&mdash;that can solve some of these social issues. I will conclude on those remarks. I support the shadow minister's amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) because he is consistent. He always shows that he does not know what he is talking about. It is very well to spout off about looking at the whole social picture rather than throwing money at social security. Throwing money at it: what the hell does that mean? There are some very concrete proposals here which are not throwing money at anything. He also talks about the bureaucracy. He obviously does not know much about the bureaucracy because he is talking about an Austudy situation which is covered by DEET and not DSS, as he says, and I think we can also safely say that no office in Manly would insist that somebody goes to Wollongong for a job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Spouting off rhetoric is all very fine, but I think it is also pretty hypocritical. The member for Cowan came into this place at the same time as I did, at the 1993 election, and he would have campaigned on Fightback&mdash;a document which wanted to take people off social security after nine months. So it is extremely hypocritical for someone like him to stand up in here and say that the Labor Party has lost the plot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this bill is very significant. Social security, as I think almost everyone has said in the debate so far, is very important. Australia has one of the best social security systems in the world, without a doubt. It is, as the member for Cowan has said, very complex, and I know that the current Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) is doing all he can to smooth out those complexities and make the system easier to run. He has in hand at the moment some ways of looking at simplifying the kinds of payments and the number of payments so that they are easier to understand by the general public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With something as complex as social security, which involves people on the ground, people in need and people who are vulnerable, as it very much does, loopholes and inconsistencies appear and have to be fixed up. That is precisely what this bill does. It may seem to someone glancing at it that it is a hotchpotch of odd bits and pieces, but it is putting together a whole lot of issues that do need amending and do need adjusting. I think they are adjusted to the benefit of the people who receive them. Finetuning is always needed in any legislation to do with such a complex area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of issues here and I do not intend to run through them all. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) has already done that, in the second reading speech. I would like to just mention a couple of those issues before I go on to the issue which, for me, is one of the most important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to first allude to the benefits for carers. It was not that long ago in this country&mdash;and those of us of a certain age can remember the time&mdash;that we did not even call them `carers'; we just took it for granted that a spouse, a daughter, a son, a cousin or a neighbour would look after those in need, and we did not look after them. I think carers are being recognised. Certainly, this government has gone a long way to recognising the role that carers play in the HACC&mdash;home and community care&mdash;program. They are part of the target group, and we endeavour to do as much as we can for them by providing respite and so on. The carers pension is something that I think we need to be justly proud of, and these amendments which affect carers are very important. Anything we can do for carers to help them while they are caring for people and to help them into training or employment at a time when they are no longer in caring positions is extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other one is retaining fringe benefits for six months for people coming out of the mature age allowance and partner allowance. These are important, because they do encourage people to get back into the work force when they may feel that they are losing too much, particularly in the sense of fringe benefits, to actually go back into the work force. I think that transitional period is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other clauses here, which refer to disability, mobility, sole parent pensions, family payments and so on. They cover almost every area of social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one that I want to spend some time on is the amendment regarding exchange trading systems. This holds a particular joy for me, because I raised this issue with the Minister for Social Security in 1993. In fact, I was just looking through my file and realised that, for the letter I wrote to the minister at that time, I did not even have my proper letterhead, I was so new to this place. So it is very important for me to see that something that I brought up has now reached this stage. I am sure those of us who are fairly new backbenchers in this place often feel that we do not have very much influence, so it is particularly gratifying to me to find something that I raised personally has now reached the stage of being enshrined in legislation. In fact, when the minister was going through this bill with the caucus community services committee and he mentioned my involvement, the chairman of the committee, the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), said, `We will call this the Deahm amendment.' I am very happy to accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic problem concerned people who were involved in exchange trading systems in my area and were dealing with the Katoomba office of the DSS&mdash;which was being conscientious; I am not criticising it in any way. Because this scheme was so prevalent in the area, social security recipients were asked whether they were involved in one of the schemes and, if so, how much they had earned in their credits under the program&mdash;ecos, as they are called in this particular area. Each eco was then counted as a dollar of income, so they lost their social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The local group, called LETS&mdash;the Local Exchange and Trading System&mdash;wrote to the minister. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LETS income does not pay rates, electricity, gas or phone bills or provide food and shelter on a livable level. LETS does provide a situation where unemployed people can maintain their skill levels, gain experience in new skill areas and maintain a high level of self-esteem which ensures a healthier lifestyle and thus less strain on the National Health Care System.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LV5">Ms DEAHM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I am glad to hear that the honourable member for Ballarat thinks it is a good system, too. I immediately took this matter up with the minister, who had a discussion with people from the LETS group, the Welfare Rights Association and a number of other groups who all added their contributions. After some discussion, the minister approved the dropping of this practice. Now we see it coming up in legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the points made by the department was that these people were working in a formal situation but they were not very different from people who were working in an informal situation: for example, two people on sole parent benefits baby-sitting for each other with no money or credits being exchanged; they were gaining a benefit and they were doing some work, in a sense. I am glad to see that that has been recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">LETS is a very important organisation. It benefits unemployed and underemployed people. It also benefits some employed people who receive payment for some of their work and receive credits under the LETS program for other work. LETS uses the skills of people&mdash;particularly the unemployed and the underemployed&mdash;and keeps their skills going. People are not going to lose their skills while waiting for a job to come up. It was a community initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Blue Mountains, where it is particularly active, it came out of a group known as the Coalition Against the Recession which started up a few years ago. Various groups were formed to look at how the local people could help those who were suffering under the recession. It included food collections where bins were placed outside the local supermarket. People could buy an extra item and put it in the bin so that it could be distributed. The LETS program is one of the more permanent programs to come out of that initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have only the 1993 statistics, but at that time there were 170 LETS programs nationwide. The Blue Mountains group has 1,500 members. The monthly turnover was 35,000 ecos. As I said, we count an eco as the equivalent of approximately $1. I understand that there was no problem with people having ecos credited as income for tax purposes. Fundamentally, no-one has objected to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great thing about the scheme is that it encompasses a wide range of workers including builders, plumbers, accountants, people doing tax returns, baby-sitters and lawn-mowers. It is extremely beneficial. In my electorate the LETS scheme has undertaken what is called a buddy scheme. Established members introduce and help new members in getting used to how the scheme works. They teach them the ropes and, perhaps, teach them some new skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people say to me, `I can't afford to employ someone to mow my lawn. I can't do it myself because I am not physically able. I can't get this sort of help under home and community care because there are higher priorities.' The LETS program has responded to this by introducing what is called a community service fund. This invites members of the group to donate either money, ecos or time to a fund from which the services can be provided for people in need&mdash;particularly the frail, the aged and the disabled. So, I have been able to put the little old lady who cannot mow her lawn on to members of the LETS group and they have been able to do it for her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The LETS group has also cooperated with a group known as Mission Employment. This is a skill share operation which is run by the Sydney City Mission in my electorate. They started a group called LETS work to promote the scheme to people who have been recently retrenched. As many of us know, when people are retrenched their initial thought is, `That's fine. I will have a little holiday.' However, they start looking around for jobs and, when they find nothing is coming, their self-esteem drops, their confidence drops, and they are put in a position where they do not find it very easy to go out and get work. Of course, their skills also drop. LETS work, together with the LETS group and Mission Employment, is there to get those people moving and also to teach them some of the skills that could earn them some ecos and keep them in work while they are looking for full-time employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to this bill removes the provision requiring that kind of exchange work to be counted in the income test for social security. However, there are certain restrictions. Firstly, the normal activity test requires members to continue to look for appropriate work. They cannot say, `We are doing this for a living.' They have to be looking for work. Secondly, cash amounts are not exempt. If they happen to get cash for any of those jobs, they must declare it. Thirdly, the social security secretary must be satisfied that the system is a local community based system, the primary purpose of which is to help persons maintain their labour skills and keep them in touch with the labour market. It is not run with a view to making a profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even with those requirements&mdash;the LETS group is certainly happy with those requirements&mdash;we have gained a victory in this case. I am very proud of the LETS program. There are several of them in my electorate and the members do a wonderful job. I was glad to hear the member for Ballarat endorse that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I helped launch the Ballarat LETS project last year, so I endorse the sentiments of the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm). However, I am somewhat disappointed that someone whose company I enjoy and who I quite like on a personal basis perpetuates this myth that the coalition had a nine-month unemployment policy before the last election. I say in the clearest possible terms: that is wrong. I hope that, having heard it refuted in such strong terms, the member for Macquarie will never again utter that untruth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate on the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 has been very wide ranging, and I think that is appropriate in the circumstances. I would like to commend to the House the speech of the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) who exposed the Labor rhetoric for what it is. It really shows the utter hypocrisy of the government on the question of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country we have seen the gap between the rich and the poor widen. That is happening despite the rhetoric of the government&mdash;and despite its rhetoric, the government is doing absolutely nothing about it. Its absolute hypocrisy on the question of social justice is now reaching legendary proportions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would go so far as to say that history will show this government as an equity fraud because it continues to perpetuate this social justice myth. The Australian people are awake to this. They will no longer be conned by this government. They know that equity ALP style means giving it to Labor mates and the rest can go to hell. That is the way the ALP has been operating in politics for the last 10 years and I have no doubt that is the way it will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to look at Austudy as an example of Labor's absolute belief that the country stops at the end of the metropolitan tram routes or bus routes. As far as the rest of the country is concerned, people can sink or swim. This has always been Labor's attitude and will continue to be its attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was on the phone this morning to a constituent from Stawell who told me that because he has to send his daughter, a trainee nurse, to an institution away from Stawell, his family is suffering a cost penalty which I, and others who have looked into this closely, believe is nearly $170 a week. That is simply because they live outside metropolitan Australia. That is not social justice, that is not equity, and nothing has been done to address that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Macquarie had a go at the member for Cowan for talking about matters that fell within the DEET portfolio. When you are paying $170 a week financial penalty for having to educate your child outside your regional rural area you are coming within the domain of the Department of Social Security. The two are very much tied together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before this House is of significance to a number of Australians. It is therefore unfortunate that this legislation is in many ways a patchwork piece of legislation which does nothing more than redress the tardiness of this government in its haphazard approach to policy making. As has been previously stated by my colleagues, a number of pieces of legislation will be affected by the bill, including the Social Security Act 1991, the National Health Act 1963, the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 and the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very broadly, this bill proposes amendments to the aforementioned legislation. Although these amendments in themselves may not introduce major policy changes, they are nevertheless very significant in what they propose. The bill proposes changes to the eligibility qualifications for the carers pension which, if passed, would allow the carer to receive the pension while the carer and the person being cared for are overseas for a period of up to three months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also aims to extend the employment and education entry payments to recipients of the carers pension, eligibility for fringe benefits to people who cease to receive the disability support pension for a period of 12 months and eligibility of the mobile allowance. The bill also aims to ensure that credits which are approved under trading systems, certain barter arrangements&mdash;the honourable member for Macquarie has already mentioned that in relation to the LETS schemes&mdash;are not deemed income for the purposes of social security payments. Finally, this bill aims to bring forward the date from which a benefit is not payable due to changed circumstances where the recipient notifies the department of these changed circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the moves by the shadow minister for social security and senior citizens, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), to have this bill considered by the Senate committee on community affairs, especially given the concerns expressed by the coalition about certain aspects of the bill. Having this piece of legislation referred to the committee is the only way that we can gain a better understanding of the full implications of the bill away from the restraints which this chamber imposes. The coalition is committed to ensuring that all legislation is given proper and deserved consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just because the coalition will not be opposing the bill does not mean that we are content with many aspects of it. There are a number of proposed amendments to the bill which the coalition has serious concerns about. Although these have been alluded to by my colleagues, I will elaborate on them later in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill gives due recognition to the role the carers play in our society. Carers are, in my view, the unsung heroes in our society as they provide a much needed and very difficult service to those in need. Carers provide daily care and constant supervision to prevent injury to people being cared for, as well as injury to other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be classed as a carer, a person must not be employed or study for more than 10 hours a week. A carer will continue to satisfy this requirement even if there are breaks in the caring period to a maximum of 42 days a year. The job the carers do is both demanding and sometimes&mdash;I stress the word `sometimes'&mdash;with little reward. The role carers play is essential and deserves to be further commended. It is a job which I believe many of us would concede requires great strength and great courage. It requires a very special type of person to care for someone who is severely handicapped and living in the same house as the carer or in an adjacent dwelling. The personal care task is based on the personal care required by the disabled person and tasks directly related to that person's needs, such as daily attention, bathing, hygiene, food preparation and administering of medication, to name a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to say that carers are a vital part of my electorate of Ballarat. These carers provide many different types of support to many different types of people, both financial and emotional. Sometimes emotional support is just as important as financial support, if not more so. Carers can be individuals or groups, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate there are a number of support groups that are carers. I will go through those, because, as far as my electorate is concerned, they are important and they are providing a valuable service. I would like to place on the public record my support for the work they are doing. These support groups in Ballarat include: ADARDS, the Alzheimers disease and related disorders support group; ADDVANCE, which is the active attention deficit disorder support group; the AIDS care team; the congenital disabilities support group; the cystic fibrosis group; Diabetes Australia; Grow, the community mental health self-help organisation in Daylesford, in what will be part of my new electorate; the headway carers group; the Motor Neurone Disease Association of Victoria; the  Muscular Dystrophy Association; the obsessive, compulsive disorder group; the Parkinsons support group; and the post polio support group. There are also a number of other carer groups that are just outside my electorate. These groups provide a desperately needed and, in my view, underrecognised service to many of my constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill looks to providing such carers with wider services. The amendments to the carer pension would allow a carer to accompany the caree overseas without a loss of qualification, provided the period of absence is temporary and does not exceed three months in a calender year. Currently, a frail or disabled person who is cared for may travel overseas for a holiday without affecting entitlement. However, the person may not be accompanied by their carer because of the restrictions on the portability of the carer pension. Although there are minor exceptions to this rule, this is a grossly unfair situation during such time that carees are in most need of their carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the amendment in the bill overcomes this gross injustice, the coalition is concerned that, with the government's phasing out of wive's pensions, more wives or de facto partners will claim a carers pension; and that when their spouses go overseas&mdash;their pension is portable for 12 months&mdash;they will receive payment for only three months. This is an area which must be urgently addressed for it has the potential to increase dramatically the bill's financial impact. If the government is serious about providing an effective service to those genuinely in need, at the same time minimising the impact of rorting within the system, then such anomalies in the legislation must be tightened. To ensure this is effectively done, the bill must be referred to the Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill further proposes the introduction of an employment entry payment and an education entry payment for recipients of the carer pension. The amendment proposes a payment of $100 to be made in recognition of the costs involved in starting employment, with an additional amount of $200 to be payable to assist with the costs of commencement of education. In order for jobsearch and newstart allowees to be eligible for the proposed employment education entry payments, they must cancel their social security payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does, however, have justified concerns regarding this proposal. On the face of it&mdash;and I stress `on the face of it'&mdash;it would appear incompatible that a person in full-time study could fulfil their requirements to provide constant care and attention to a person in need. If the 10-hour rule which applies to work were to also apply to study contact it could be argued that a carer could engage in full-time study at the same time as providing care and qualify for the pension. However, one could envisage possible problems for carers, especially during times of high stress, such as the exam period. It may be that the committee will review the definition of a carer in terms of hours spent in providing care to see whether full-time study is likely to have an impact on the ability to adequately provide this care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with interest that the bill proposes the restoration of fringe benefits to the disability support pension. This amendment will allow clients whose disability support pension is cancelled because of earnings to retain their eligibility for fringe benefits for a period of 12 months. This concession would also apply to the dependent partners of these disability support pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is, in effect, a signal of failure on behalf of the government. On 1 April 1993, the Social Security Act was amended to extend the availability of fringe benefits to all disability support pensioners regardless of income. This was to be a crowning moment for a government which had deluded itself into thinking that it was capable of delivering social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the bill was not properly thought out and a consequence of this change was that the relevant amendments restricted the continuation of fringe benefits to pensioners who lost qualification for the disability support pension because they commenced full-time work. This, in effect, meant that a beneficiary who had the pension cancelled because of his or her earnings but had not commenced full-time work was not entitled to the 12-month fringe benefit extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government now claims that this amendment will correct this unintended consequence and ensure that beneficiaries, whose disability support pensions are cancelled because of their earnings, obtain their eligibility for fringe benefits for a period of 12 months. Had the original bill been dealt with in an orderly and appropriate fashion, through the appropriate mechanisms, we would not have to go through this amendment stage today. The Australian people can only conclude that this legislation is a telltale sign of a government which is tired and worn out, losing both the will and the ability to effectively govern the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this is not the only amendment in the bill which reveals the true extent of the government's inertia. This bill also proposes the suspension of fringe benefits for those receiving the disability support pension. Currently, if disability support pensioners lost qualification as a result of commencing full-time work, they would have their pension suspended for a period of two years, rather than having it cancelled. Should the person again become qualified for a disability support pension during that two-year period, an accelerated restoration process replaces the need for a new claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us remember that this provision which was introduced by the government as part of the disability reform package was designed to provide incentive for clients to attempt employment. The current situation is in stark contrast to that of a pensioner who has the disability pension cancelled because of earnings from part-time work. These pensioners would need to undergo a new claim assessment process if they again became eligible for a pension any time. This situation, ironically, provides a disincentive, as do many of the government's policies, for pensioners to attempt part-time work. This in most cases is the only option which is available to the many recipients of the disability support package, which purports to supplement their pension.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, had the government had the foresight and common decency to process the bill properly, it would not have to introduce a bandaid fix-it approach, as we are doing today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other bandaid approach which is characteristic of the amendment is the endeavour to backdate partner allowance. Why could this not have been introduced when the partner allowance was brought before the chamber initially? The department claims this will have a negligible effect. However, the department's administrative arrangements are such that this measure could have been implemented without legislative authorisation&mdash;thus, backdating was sought. The government simply must learn that, unless legislation is dealt with properly the first time, we will always be returning to this chamber to replaster, reupholster and rework legislation as it falls apart. Based on the government's record, we have little cause for optimism on this front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are areas of this bill which, if not handled delicately, could have serious negative effects. One such example is the amendment to ensure that the secretary has the power to collect information from clients and from third parties as to whether or not a claimant is entitled to a seniors health card. The coalition shares the concerns of the Council on the Ageing, that the term `third party' is not adequately defined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair for us to believe that the information collected from the third party should be made available to the claimant upon request. Although we want to legislate against rorts within the system, we should not let this be at the price of individual privacy. Again, the ramifications are too serious to allow this to be handled in the same hotchpotch way it has been. The Senate committee is the only way that these issues can be truly dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another such amendment is the qualification for sole parents. There is a danger that this could result in intrusive inquiries into the lives of prospective sole parent pensioners and their friends of the opposite sex. This amendment could also have a more serious effect on women who are seeking an urgent payment of the pension because they have a violent partner. When the relationship is investigated, the issue of the permanence of the separation arises and the absent partner is given the power to state that that person believes the separation to be short term because of domestic disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In such situations the claimant could be denied the pension because of that statement, thus the department may assist in compelling a woman with no other income to return to her violent partner. It is no surprise, therefore, that the Catholic Social Welfare Commission has called for a more precise definition of `strictly temporary basis'. I am sure we are all aware of what the consequences would be if the government has got this amendment wrong. This chamber should support the coalition's proposal to ensure a court order is obtained so that claimants who have left a violent partner are not forced to return to what potentially could be a home situation which threatens the safety of the claimant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The safety and security of the victim should be paramount in the delivery of such payments but, at the same time, we want to ensure that only those genuinely in need have access to those payments. This matter is best left to the Senate committee on social welfare to ensure that the issue is properly handled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been seen, despite the significant importance of this bill to many recipients of the abovementioned allowances, it is riddled with holes. In many places it amounts to nothing more than a bandaid solution to compensate for past ineptness. As I said before, if we do not want to be here again this time next year going over old ground and putting bandaids on top of bandages to desperately try to hold this legislation together, let us do it properly this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the coalition has managed to find such problems with the bill in the short period of time that we have had access to it, imagine what problems the Senate committee on social welfare could find in the bill. It is time this government understood that the processes and procedures of this chamber are an essential part of any legislation and that we will subject all legislation to these mechanisms to ensure they receive the proper scrutiny. This bill is a classic example of what happens when legislation does not receive the proper care and attention the first time. The government owes it to the people of Australia so that the same mistake is not made on this occasion, especially on such an important piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the remaining 45 seconds can I say that we on this side of the House are the ones who are genuinely concerned about social justice in this country. One of the key people leading that role in this chamber is the shadow minister, the member for Berowra. If you look through what has been said in this House over the many years that he has been here, especially since he has had those responsibilities, you will see time after time that true social justice has been generated from this side of the House by the member for Berowra. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are here today to debate and consider the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. To take up one of the issues which has been considered by a number of speakers, this is a bill which has a range of, in some respects, unrelated clauses leading to a number of minor changes in the operation of the legislation. The nature of this parliament and of government as a whole in this country, both now and in the past under earlier governments, is such that the legislation that we deal with in this chamber is often amendment legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot expect to get everything right the first time because circumstances change and issues develop. In those circumstances, any responsible government would move to respond to what has happened to ensure that it maintains the integrity of the system for the country as a whole. That has been the experience not only of this government but also of previous conservative governments right back to Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill makes a number of minor amendments to the Social Security Act. The act is a particularly complex piece of legislation running to over 1,300 sections, defining entitlements to a large number of payment categories with wide ranging rights of appeal to independent tribunals. I think the range of amendments contained in the bill have been well canvassed by many of the speakers, in particular the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) in her initial comments. However, I would like to mention three amendments in particular: entrenching the $1 increase in additional family payment in January 1995 into the benchmarks for AFP; exemption of local exchange trading system&mdash;or LETS&mdash;`credits' from the income test, which is something that both the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) and the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) spoke about at some length; and employment and education entry payments, $100 and $200 respectively, for carer pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you look at these amendments, my earlier comments on the integrity of the system and the need to adjust it on a continuing basis, I think you really get to the essence of what this government has tried to do on the question of the social security system. We have seen it as being an evolving thing; we have seen it as being something which encompasses more than strictly the question of benefit payments. I believe that we can stand proud for much that we have done over the last 12 years on the question of the social security system. For example, we have improved the adequacy of social security payments. The base pension increased by some 14 per cent against the CPI between March 1983 and December 1994, with Labor's longstanding commitment of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Family payments have been increased enormously. Additional family payment has increased by 75 per cent in real terms for children under 13 and by 147 per cent in real terms for children aged 13 to 15. The number of low income working families receiving AFP has increased tenfold because of wider coverage and service delivery improvements. Family allowance, and indeed all family payments, have been indexed against inflation. Australia's family payments are among the most progressive in the world. When combined with relatively progressive income tax scales, Australia's tax-transfer system is the world's most progressive as far as families with children are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From July 1995, these payments will be improved further as a result of the introduction of the parenting allowance, which will pay up to $134 per week to 118,000 low income working families where one partner stays at home to look after children. Maximum levels of rent assistance have increased by between 80 per cent and 137 per cent in real terms, and rent assistance has been extended to low income working families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures have improved the position of the most disadvantaged in Australian society very substantially both in real terms and against any `poverty line'. For example: the position of a single pensioner renting privately has improved from six per cent to 13 per cent above the Henderson poverty line, which I will discuss later; the position of a sole parent with two children renting privately has improved from nine per cent below to two per cent above the Henderson poverty line; and the position of an unemployed couple with one child renting privately has improved from 11 per cent below to one per cent above the Henderson poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most payments are underpinned by explicit benchmarks governing the pension and family payments. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has, however, asked the department to look at methodologies by which the adequacy of payments can be judged with a view to establishing priorities for future adjustments to real payment rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Targeting is an important issue within our social security system. The Labor government reintroduced comprehensive income and assets testing into the system in the mid-1980s. Most payments are targeted to those most in need&mdash;there is little `middle class welfare' in the social security system these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study by ANU academics has shown that Australia has one of the most efficient social security systems in the world in alleviating poverty as well as in purely administrative terms. We also have enhanced incentives for self-provision. People retiring now and in the future benefit from the government's enormous expansion of superannuation coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other measures to assist self-provision include: the introduction of deeming on pensioner bank accounts, which has forced the banks to pay them realistic rates of interest; the introduction of earnings credits into pensions and allowances, which encourage part-time and casual work; better linking of social security and labour market programs through, for example, the newstart and job compact arrangements for the long-term unemployed, the disability reform package and the jobs, education and training scheme for sole parents; the introduction of the child support scheme to ensure that non-custodial parents make a proper contribution to the maintenance of their children; and setting the tax rebate so that maximum-rate pensioners are not subject to income tax. From July 1995, the income test on unemployment and other allowances will be adjusted to ensure that recipients are always better off working additional hours either full time or part time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also worked to restore the integrity of the system. A wide range of compliance measures have been adopted in the system. A review in 1992 concluded that these measures had `indeed succeeded' in `correcting the relative laxity of the past and restoring public confidence in the payment system'. A comprehensive set of up-front measures ensures that payments are only granted to those entitled to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of payments have built-in compliance features. For example, continued payment of unemployment allowances is usually conditional on fortnightly lodgment of a statement of jobsearch efforts. These measures are supplemented by an array of review mechanisms under which some 2.3 million reviews are conducted each year of people's continuing eligibility for payment. These reviews save the equivalent of some $1 billion per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These mechanisms include: data matching with other agencies such as the Taxation Office, DEET, Immigration and state corrections authorities; risk-based reviews, based on statistical probabilities of success, often conducted by mobile review teams; and duration-based reviews in a number of payments, including sole parent pension and unemployment allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been a range of client service improvements. The client service statement by the then Minister for Social Security in March 1992 encompassed a range of improvements to client service delivery, including revamping Social Security offices to make them more user-friendly; the publication and updating of client service standards; and the introduction of teleservice centres to improve access via telephone calls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that my own local area in Cranbourne is the beneficiary of part of this. We recently turned the sod, in effect, in the construction of a DSS office in Cranbourne. It is in the middle of the south-eastern growth corridor in an area of Melbourne that is growing rapidly&mdash;one of only several in Melbourne, I might add, under the Kennett government&mdash;and it is an area that is in urgent need of government services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Minister for Social Security, Neal Blewett, recognised this and two years ago a decision was made to fund an office. It has gone through that process. A site has been selected and construction has commenced. We hope that office will be operating by around June this year. That Department of Social Security office will incorporate a more user-friendly approach and move away from what is sometimes thought to be its inquisitorial nature. It will try to ensure that the dignity of those who use those services is respected. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In today's debate, there has been a fairly long-ranging use of statistics. An old line many of us know is that there are lies, damned lies, and statistics. We all use them to good effect when it suits us. But we need to go beyond statistics and look at studies. They are not infallible but they take into account more than just statistics. They can look at effective comparisons. A range of studies in recent years have compared retirement incomes and the social security system in Australia with those of relevant overseas countries. These studies have shown how well we have been going in, for example, the area of retirement incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent World Bank report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Averting the old age crisis: policies to protect the old and promote growth</EMPHASIS> was published by the World Bank late last year. It addressed a range of issues in relation to the nature of age patterns, and what income services and other supports were available.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study suggests that Labor's combination of a more means-tested public pension and the introduction of the Superannuation Guarantee Levy is a far-sighted move which will make the greying of Australia less financially painful than in most other industrialised countries.</PARA>
<PARA>In October last year, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) made the point in the House that Thailand is currently developing a comprehensive social security system. It will use what is effectively the Australian model because, through research, it has found that it is the most likely to succeed. There is no greater credit than someone replicating your efforts. That also puts the actual effectiveness and efficiency of our system in good stead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study done at the ANU by Professor Gruen, Dr Deborah Mitchell and Professor Ann Harding compared the social security systems of Australia and nine other developed countries. That study concluded that, of the 10 nations studied, we have easily the most efficient system of getting the dollars to those who need it. That has to be a major benchmark with respect to the operation of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond that, there have been other studies. There was a study done last year titled `Living decently', which was authored by Sue Richardson and Peter Travers. In their conclusion they stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the 1980s most Australians were indeed living decently. Material affluence was at an all-time high. Australia was still ranked around the middle of the dozen most equal countries in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>They also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a world leader when it comes to social mobility. Our positive picture of high levels of affluence and of relative equality is at variance with the gloom and doom that is typical of many editorial writers and political social commentators.</PARA>
<PARA>Another study which related to this particular issue came out in the OECD's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Employment Outlook</EMPHASIS> for July 1993, which contains a table on earnings dispersion for the year 1991. Again I stress that, when you are talking about the social security system in Australia, the position of people in benefits situations and those with low incomes, you simply have to look beyond the amount of money they receive. You have to look at Medicare and educational opportunities; you have to look at a range of activities beyond that simple matter of the amount of money they may receive; you have to look at allowances, rental subsidies, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That study showed that Australia has one of the least unequal distributions of earnings in the developed world, following the Scandinavian countries. To get a comparison, the measure of inequality was shown to be 50 per cent higher in the United Kingdom than in this country and 2 1/2 times higher in the United States. The real concern here, which relates to where we are going as a country and where we may go if there is a change of government, is that those countries which have strongly embraced labour market deregulation&mdash;have moved away from awards&mdash;are those that are in fact facing the greatest inequality. That fact is clearly coming through in the studies, and there has been much media and press comment about it. Now university research is pointing to that fact and making it very clear to everyone that that is the case. </PARA>

I certainly do not wish to say that there is no poverty out there and that it is not a real concern. What I am saying is that this government has done an awful lot to address those issues and to move on from the situation we inherited some 12 years ago. I am also saying that to get a relevant, fair and reasonable comparison of the situation in Australia one has to look overseas to see what other nations have done&mdash;how the other governments during the time that we have been in power faced the same international circumstances and acted as they saw fit. </PARA>

To the extent that it does that, we on this side of the House support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow minister said in his introductory remarks, this bill also highlights the complexities of our social security system. As we have noted in this place on a number of occasions, there has been an explosion in welfare in this country in the last 10 years since this Labor government came into power. For example, in 1980 there were 289,400 people getting a disability pension; in 1993 that figure increased to 524,900. In 1980 there were 70,400 people getting supporting parent or sole parent benefits; in 1993 that figure quadrupled to 298,400. In 1980 there were 311,000 people getting unemployment benefits; in 1993 that figure almost trebled to 913,800. In 1980 there were 122,900 people getting student income support; by 1993 that figure almost quadrupled to 423,600. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, unfortunately, all sorts of disincentives within the system which I believe are designed to push more and more people into the welfare system. In my contribution to this debate today, I will reflect on what I think is a very real concern in the community about the spread of welfare. Welfare costs, or welfare outlays, if you want to use that terminology, as a percentage of our gross domestic product have doubled in the last 20 years. Government speakers come into this place belabouring the fact that it is a good thing; that it is a product of an enlightened Australian society. To some extent, it may well be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me repeat what I have said in this place on a number of occasions: this government has a program for every problem&mdash;and it created most of those problems in the first place. We do not have to go much further than unemployment to recognise that. The huge cost of unemployment benefits to this country is a product of the economic mismanagement of this country by this government. Let us look at those getting disability pensions, which have doubled since 1980. Many of those people rightly qualify for disability pensions but they are being used by the government in a way that has actually reduced the number of unemployed. Many government programs&mdash;for problems that it created&mdash;have achieved that end. They have simply disguised the level of unemployment. So rather than having 800,000 or 900,000 unemployed people in this country, we probably have twice that many. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government comes in here and crows about the number of jobs it has created it is not honest with us about the figures. It mostly talks about jobs as being part-time jobs; they are short hour jobs. In fact, very few people in the community probably realise that the definition of employment for the purpose of being classed as unemployed is that you worked only one hour in the week before you were surveyed to participate in the collection of those figures. So if you worked for one hour you are classed as being employed; that is, not unemployed. </PARA>

This is an all-encompassing bill that deals with a number of matters affecting social security, and it is in that context that I am making my remarks. I appreciate the fact that you have vindicated me on that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was talking about the fact that welfare has to be paid out of taxes. It seems to me that the incidence of taxation in this country is falling more and more on those who are less and less able to pay it. We are already being softened up by the government and by the welfare industry for tax increases based on the false premise that Australia is a low tax country. It is not a low tax country. In fact, taxes have increased consistently over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1967 the tax rate for the median taxpayer was 24.6 per cent and in 1990 that had increased to 40.3 per cent. There are lots of other ways in which we can measure the figures, but the clear facts are that Australia is not a low tax country. If we want to have this welfare state that has been imposed on us by this government then it has to be paid for. The fact is that when you have all these programs that you cook up every day&mdash;and we will probably hear about some more in question time today; every time a minister gets on his feet in this place it is to tell us about how they will spend some more money fixing up a problem they have created&mdash;then they have to be paid for, and of course they can only be paid for out of taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say quite clearly that I believe a relatively wealthy and fortunate nation such as Australia should be able to take care of those who are genuinely unable to take care of themselves or who are genuinely disadvantaged. There would be no difference in the opinions held by members on that side of the House or on our side of the House on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the system imposed on us by this government goes way beyond this. The fact is that today we have before us complex legislation&mdash;simply because the social security legislation is so complex itself&mdash;and, because it is complex, it lends itself to abuse and fraud. Recently my local paper the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gold Coast Bulletin</EMPHASIS> brought to light a number of instances of fraud which are quite alarming. On Tuesday, 17 January under the headline `$184m welfare fraud clamp' it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government `dole buster' teams have saved the Department of Social Security almost $4 million in fraud and over-payments on the Gold Coast in the past six months.</PARA>
<PARA>That is good news. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mobile review teams, based at Surfers Paradise and Tweed Heads, act on public tip-offs about dole fraud and also check unemployment claims at random.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact that they have discovered that extent of fraud in what amounts to spot checks indicates the extent to which the system is being abused. This should not surprise us, because certainly not a week goes by without the office of every member in this place being approached by people who are able to instance fraud and abuse of the social security system. The reason that occurs is simply that the system is so complex. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gold Coast Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 21 January 1995, under the headline `Students' $5m Austudy rort', says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gold Coast region students have reaped a $5 million windfall from a subsidy rort&mdash;and authorities yesterday vowed to haul the guilty ones before the courts.</PARA>
<PARA>We are glad they have vowed to haul the guilty ones before the courts, but the fact once again is that this is an indication of the extent of abuse within the system. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 20 June 1994, under the headline `Crackdown nabs staff hands in social security till', states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government's computer clampdown on social security fraud is catching cheats with senior jobs within the Department of Social Security as well as small-time rorters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department has uncovered $18.8 million in fraud since July 1 last year, of which $2.5 million involved 11 senior staff in departmental branch offices.</PARA>
<PARA>I am demonstrating here that there is a considerable amount of fraud&mdash;and there is plenty of evidence of that&mdash;within the social security system. The reason for it is simply that the legislation is so complex. I have no objection whatsoever to the tightening up of requirements for access to benefits. </PARA>

The interesting statistic that came out in that particular survey was that 56 per cent of unemployed people themselves supported those sorts of schemes. </PARA>

In 1980 there were 70,400 supporting parent benefit recipients and in 1993 there were four times as many&mdash;298,400. Why is that?

That happens to be the objective of the government. We also do it from not a bad position, because it has to be said that the interest rates that are being paid, for example, by our home buyers now at this point of time are at a level they never fell below in the last period of the Treasurer opposite us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question because he has been at the forefront of the campaign to ensure that Queensland does get its fairer share of places for university education. I am aware of the report that the honourable member refers to. It comes from a speech that the shadow spokesman for education made in Brisbane on 15 February. It was a disappointing speech because not only did it not give any detail of what the opposition policy on higher education might be, it also failed to live up to expectations that it had fed the gallery in terms of having further leaks about what the government might be doing in its budget round.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All it did was put fear into the minds of university students, those 500 extra students that got places as a result of our policy at the end of last year, that those places might not continue. The fact is that these places are not at risk. Not only have we honoured the promise in terms of delivering those 500 places, we have already funded them. I can give a guarantee that that funding will continue over the life of the degree. There is no point funding one year of a degree if what we are trying to do is raise the opportunity for people in Queensland to get into university. Not only can I give the guarantee that the 500 places are safe, I can tell the House that we will go beyond the 500 places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the time these were announced that this was a down payment on our commitment to redress the inequity that has occurred in the system whereby Queensland&mdash;and it is not the only area where this is the case&mdash;has seen significant growth in its population ahead of the rest of the country but university places have not followed in the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a government are committed both to access in terms of ensuring that university places are available near to where the people live and to equity in the way in which those places are handed out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am currently in discussions with the higher education sector about a number of priorities impacting upon that sector within the context of the forthcoming budget. The allocation of places to Queensland and to the other growth areas is only one component of it. I can assure the House that, whatever the outcome in terms of what this package of measures involves, it will not involve up-front fees for undergraduates. That is a clear commitment that this government makes and which it reaffirmed at the party conference last September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We as a government are committed to people having the opportunity to enter university based on merit, not on money; that is, not on their capacity to pay. But this, of course, stands in stark contrast to the opposition policy&mdash;or what we can glean from it&mdash;so far as higher education is concerned. Senator Hill has been quite silent in terms of what the opposition proposes for higher education.

On 26 November last year, I had the pleasure of announcing the integration of the Daw Park Repatriation Hospital into the state public hospital system of the South Australian government. Integration of the hospital will take place on 9 March this year. The changeover will involve a payment of some $220 million over four years to provide for the treatment of veterans in South Australian public hospitals. The key aspect of the package is that the Commonwealth will make a specific capital contribution of some $13 million for the construction of a new rehabilitation facility at the hospital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new facility will provide significant benefits for the local community as well as entitle war veterans and war widows to reside within 20 kilometres of the hospital. Integration will secure Daw Park's future as an acute care teaching hospital and will guarantee continuing access for veterans to its high quality treatment services. I, with the Minister for Human Services and Health, intend to officially hand over the hospital to the state on 10 March. Special veterans services&mdash;such as outpatients clinics, psychiatric, aged and extended care and rehabilitation and hospice services, will also be retained. A newsletter reporting on the joint announcement and the support of all major ex-service organisations was sent out on 6 January.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members may have seen the report on Monday's edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> on Channel 9 hosted by Ray Martin. That program featured a number of claims about sole parent pensioners. It implied that a significant number of sole parent pensioners are teenage girls having children solely in order to gain access to the sole parent pension. It also claimed that little or nothing is being done to ensure that both parents of children of sole parent pensioners are making a contribution to their upkeep and that nothing much is being done to create incentives for sole parent pensioners to take up work opportunities, and so forth. In other words, it referred to all the standard negative stereotypes of sole parent pensioners that do so much harm to those people and their children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the facts? It is important to provide a few on this matter. Firstly, the vast majority of sole parent pensioners achieve that status after the break-up of an existing marriage or marriage-like relationship. The average age of sole parent pensioners is 33 for women and 38 for men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, a picture is purveyed that sole parent pensioners are teenagers but the reality is that three per cent of sole parent pensioners are teenagers and that fewer than one per cent of sole parent pensioners are under the age of 18. Over the last 20 years or so the number of teenage births has declined markedly in this country by around 60 per cent, which coincides with the availability period of the sole parent pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation is in marked contrast to that of the United States. A very different pattern exists in that country in terms of sole parent pensioners. The numbers are rising sharply and the whole picture is very different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Those who watched the program would never have guessed at the existence of the child support scheme, which has been in operation since 1989. That scheme has a requirement for parents to take reasonable steps to seek maintenance before they can get the sole parent pension. As a result of that scheme, the number of sole parent pensioners receiving child support has doubled in the last five years. The average level of child support has risen markedly over that period from $44 to $68 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I turn to work incentives. A major focus of government activity has been on the so-called JET program&mdash;the jobs, education and training program. That is unquestionably one of the most effective labour market interventions that we have. It is demonstrably successful and will shortly be generating net savings on government outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the overall picture. As a result, the proportion of sole parent pensioners deriving income from non-government sources has increased quite significantly in recent years. All those facts are hardly consistent with the picture of large numbers of teenage girls having children just so they can access the sole parent pension. The average duration of sole parent pension is now down to about three years. It is terribly unfortunate that a program with such a wide viewership should continue to pervade these negative stereotypes, which do immense harm to people and families.</PARA>

<PARA>I am very pleased that, in the last day or so, a couple of non-governmental organisations, including CARE Australia, have come out in support of such a code. Those 93 non-governmental organisations which belong to ACFOA&mdash;the vast majority of the 120 non-governmental organisations in the aid field&mdash;already sign up to the existing ACFOA code of ethics, which in my experience is rigorous and effective.

The legal advice that I have had in a preliminary way is that compliance with such a code could be a prerequisite for tax deductibility status. Incidentally, I note that Malcolm Fraser's reported concern that such a code might be used to obtain lists of donors is quite misplaced. I assure the House that there is no intention that any code of practice would require that.</PARA>

It will also examine international best practice.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) drew my attention to a case involving an injunction being sought to prevent the publication of a report by the Ombudsman. The honourable member asked me to consider whether an issue of privilege existed and asked whether the House should be represented in the proceedings. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) also commented, asking me to consider the actions of the party seeking the injunction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Chifley asked whether I was aware of any previous such case. I have to say that I am not. As I understand it, the situation is as follows. The Ombudsman has prepared a report and, at this stage, has provided a copy to the chairperson of ATSIC under section 15 of the relevant act. Under the Ombudsman Act, the Ombudsman may publish reports and may provide a copy to the Prime Minister. This could occur where the Ombudsman had concerns following consideration of a report by the agency concerned&mdash;under section 16 and section 35A of the act. Another possible step is for the Ombudsman to provide the report for tabling in the parliament. This could occur if, for example, the Ombudsman still had concerns following the provision of a report to the Prime Minister&mdash;under section 17 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the particular case raised by the honourable member, ATSIC has sought an injunction from the Federal Court to prevent the Ombudsman from publishing the report and from providing a copy to the Prime Minister. Such action is allowed for by the legislation&mdash;section 11A applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I am advised, an injunction could not be obtained, and has not been sought, to prevent the Ombudsman from dealing with her report in accordance with the Ombudsman Act. Rather, I am informed, ATSIC alleges that the Ombudsman has breached the act and that, therefore, the report is not a proper or valid report. The Ombudsman has undertaken not to publish her report pending the resolution of these issues by the court. The matter is scheduled to come before the Federal Court in Sydney later this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, it is not common for such reports to be tabled in parliament. Whether this eventually happens depends on the earlier processes and, in particular, on the Ombudsman's views as to the responses received. It seems to me that there is, at this stage, no issue of the rights of members or the House being infringed. It is possible that the case will prevent further publication of the report but, as I understand it, the actions taken have not been directed at the parliament in any way. As indicated, there is no requirement that such reports be presented to parliament. This is a matter for the judgment of the Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may also take the view that, should such a document be presented to a house of parliament, the person responsible for providing it may be entitled to seek the protection of the law concerning parliamentary privilege in any case. I do not believe that a prima facie case of breach of privilege or contempt has been made out. Whilst I recognise the concerns of the honourable member, I do not believe it necessary or desirable for me to be represented in the proceedings. Notwithstanding, I am sure all members would have an interest in this matter. I, too, will monitor progress.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The person who makes the decisions is the real minister for communications. He is the captain of the team over there for whom this fellow is the runner. The captain of the team, of course, has a different view of communications policy to most Australians. In his view, communications policy is all about high politics. Every decision that has been taken in this area of communications has been taken for the immediate, shabby, short-term benefit of the Prime Minister and the spivs around him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In finding his substitute for media policy, Paul Keating has made more deals than Nick Leeson and, as a result of that, his media policy is about as bankrupt as Baring's bank. This rabbit on the other side of the table is not part of that high politics. His role is just to do the nightwatchman's job, to stonewall, do nothing, try not to get bowled out and do what he is told. It looks as though the millions of sporting fans and cricket lovers in this country are about to find out that he is not even up to that role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see the extraordinary sight of this minister running very hard. At one time he is over on the side of free to air television, the next time he is at the other end of the wicket, he is on the side of pay TV. He is running harder than Mark Waugh in the 49th over of a one day match. At the moment, it is like watching the fast forward on the television. He is back to one side then the other side trying to make up his mind and trying to produce some sort of result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week he was over on the side of Channel 9, it seems. Now he is on the other side. What has changed since then? Only the captain's altercation with Kerry Packer in the outfield. It is pretty clear that the Prime Minister has told this bloke to fix it, and fix it quickly. We are watching a very embarrassing performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister does deals in this area, he does them a long time ahead. He can see the event coming up. He knows when the match is going to be played, so when he wants to make a deal to sort something out for his own political purposes he does it ahead of time. When he wanted balanced coverage in the 1993 election campaign, he sorted that out. He told Conrad Black what he wanted in January-February 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's problem has been that he has left this to the very last moment. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> in July last year the minister was warned that Australis thought that it had bought the free to air and the pay TV rights to the Windies tour. There was fair warning about that, and it was fair warning to you that something had to be sorted out, and you did nothing. You usually do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July 1994, that same month, an article appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> which reported that a leading Sydney lawyer had given advice that Mr Kerry Packer could increase his interests in Fairfax beyond his current 15 per cent, up to 25 per cent, without breaching the cross-media rules. Did you clarify any of that? Were you interested in that? Then you started to say, `Well, perhaps the cross-media rules are out of date. Perhaps they have been overtaken by technology. Perhaps something will need to be done about them to change them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the Prime Minister's current view, is it? The Prime Minister's current view is that perhaps the cross-media rules need to be tightened. He is playing his political games, and you fall in behind. When the Prime Minister brought down his Creative Nation statement and he threw the ABC orchestras into chaos by suggesting that the Sydney Symphony Orchestra should be taken out of the network&mdash;the biggest network of symphony orchestras in the world&mdash;what did you do? You waited around for five months while every music lover in the country was wondering what on earth was going to happen to that network because you had not been able to resolve it. It does not matter whether it is music lovers or cricket lovers, they get the short end of the stick from you because you cannot make any significant decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In January this year, you were asked if pay TV could broadcast the Pakistan test series&mdash;one of the best cricket test series ever. You were asked whether it could be broadcast on pay TV&mdash;a series the free to air channels had not taken up. What did you say? You said you would think about it. You asked the ABA to report in the middle of the year&mdash;nine months after the series was played. So much for Australian sports lovers. That is the sort of service they get from you, Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now clear that you knew for months that Australis was claiming free to air rights for the Windies tour and you did absolutely nothing, or at least you failed to resolve the matter and all its implications. You did not take any action to find out whether the anti-siphoning rules applied or not. You allowed uncertainty to continue. As David Leckie of GTV 9 said this morning on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program, `This is a deadlock that should not have happened.' He said, `There's only one person that can break this deadlock, and that's the minister for communications, Mr Michael Lee.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where has Mr Michael Lee been all this time? He has not been there trying to sort this out. He has followed the usual form and let it drift. The ABA has given the minister some preliminary advice. It seems that the claims of Australis do not pre-empt the legislation, that it does apply, and under your legislation you had a very clear responsibility, a responsibility to determine whether the free to air channels had been given a reasonable opportunity to acquire the rights. But you did not take effective action to sort that out. You  still have not taken effective action to get a clear and immediate ruling from the Australian Broadcasting Authority as to the position under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A week ago, as I said, you seemed to be on the side of Channel 9. It proposed a 24-hour lapse between the pay TV and the free to air broadcast. You proposed 12. Of course, that was on the basis that the anti-siphoning rules actually applied to this case. But, of course, the minister is now proposing simultaneous broadcasting without setting a precedent. Why does it not set a precedent? It does not set a precedent only if the anti-siphoning rules do not apply to this case. So, in the context of one week, the minister has taken two quite opposing views about the application of the anti-siphoning rules to this case. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the minister that last May you made a promise to the Australian people. You made a promise that this anti-siphoning legislation would ensure that viewers would not be forced to pay for major sporting events which they now receive free of charge.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was it a promise to be kept or was it a big l-i-e by L-e-e? Minister, when you received that first warning, why did you not act?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance today just shows how hypocritical the opposition is on this and other issues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is important is that the government remains committed to ensuring that pay TV is about increasing the diversity of television coverage for Australians. Pay TV was not meant to force people to pay for events they have traditionally watched on free to air TV. Yesterday, Mr David Leckie, the Chief Executive Officer of Channel 9 made a few comments. One of the things he said was, `The only person who can stop this is Michael Lee.' Let me make one thing clear: there is only one thing stopping Australians watching the West Indies tour and that is Channel 9's determination and demand to have exclusivity. That is the one thing stopping this broadcast being available to Australians right across the country&mdash;and that is what has to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ridiculous for Channel 9 to claim that there is some threat to the viability of its broadcast. How can it claim that its viability of broadcasting to 18 million people is somehow undermined by 3,000 people watching it on pay TV?

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, my friend, the argument from Channel 9 is that the wedge&mdash;that is, other sporting events&mdash;will not be covered if Channel 9 agrees to simultaneous broadcasting on this event, in case you haven't noticed. We made it clear yesterday that this will not set a precedent and Australis has said, `This will not create a precedent.' So it is very clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ridiculous for Nine to suggest that in some way this compromises its position for future negotiations. Channel 9 has also claimed that, in a press release put out by Mr Leckie on 22 February, in some way it has some right. The press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"If Nine loses its fight to maintain exclusivity&mdash;that being our internationally recognised right to broadcast the cricket before Australis&mdash;we do not believe that the anti-siphoning legislation will work.</PARA>
<PARA>Unless I am a bit thick, no channel has an internationally recognised right to the cricket or any other sport&mdash;just as Channel 2, the ABC, did not have an internationally recognised right to the cricket before Mr Packer took it off them. Surely the opposition&mdash;the supporter of free enterprise&mdash;is not arguing that in some way Channel 9 has a monopoly on the rights to the cricket. Do you agree with Channel 9 on that point? I certainly hope you do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ridiculous for a broadcaster to say it had this exclusive right to be the only channel to negotiate the rights for cricket. When a network such as Nine says that it has the rights to broadcast cricket, it should be thinking of the obligations it has to its viewers. It has an obligation to its viewers to ensure that this is on free to air. The challenge is for Channel 9 to remove the roadblock that is stopping all Australians having access to the cricket. The first point is that the only thing blocking the road today as we speak is Nine's demand for exclusivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point is raised in an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> under the headline `Rugby League poised to expand into pay TV arena'. I do not know whether the opposition spokesman has seen it. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is understood that discussions are advancing between the Mr Kerry Packer-controlled Nine Network and Optus Vision to negotiate the broadcast of Rugby League on pay TV.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The director of sport for Nine, Mr Gary Burns, told <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that Optus Vision would "probably" get the use of Rugby League for its pay TV network.</PARA>
<PARA>On the one hand we have Mr Leckie saying that any event on the siphoning list must be shown exclusively on free to air, otherwise we are going to undermine the economics of free to air coverage of sport; on the other hand we have got Channel 9 saying some other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have a few questions for Channel 9. Does Channel 9's pay TV associate&mdash;that is, Optus Vision&mdash;intend to broadcast any matches which are not broadcast on free to air, in particular matches that are on the siphoning list? For example, Nine currently broadcasts two of the rugby league matches and the ABC broadcasts a third match. However, there are a lot of other matches that are currently not shown on free to air TV and that are on the siphoning list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a question for Channel 9: is it planning to allow those other matches to be shown on its pay TV channel? If that is the case, why is it okay for Channel 9's pay TV company to show an event on pay TV that is on the list but it is an outrage when Australis's pay TV company choses an event on the list? I think that Channel 9 should answer that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The essential point is: how does the siphoning list work? What we have made clear is that the rights to an event that is on the list cannot be secured by a pay TV licensee until a free to air broadcaster has first secured the rights. That is the way the legislation was intended to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to confess that I drew up a list that was pretty long. It is my very strong view that Australian viewers out there should continue to have access to the major sporting events free of charge. That is why my list was long. In fact, the opposition criticised me because it claimed my list was too long. The following statement was in the 20 May 1994 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media Australia</EMPHASIS> under the headline `Opposition concern over the extent of "free list"'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Senator Richard Alston, also warned that ensuring wide-spread free-to-air access to sporting events could be to the detriment of the developing pay-tv industry.</PARA>
<PARA>There is Senator Alston, who is still the opposition spokesman&mdash;I thought he might have got a shuffle along but he is still there&mdash;saying that he thought my list was so long that it was going to undermine the viability of pay TV. It is a bit hypocritical for opposition members to come in here and say that there is some major problem when they were the people who were saying that my list was too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give the House another quote. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 6 October under the headline `Opposition may back pay TV operators on exclusive sports deals'&mdash;do you remember that one?&mdash;it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spokeswoman said Richard Alston was concerned that the list strike a balance between free-to-air and pay TV interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"We have got to achieve a balance which continues to allow people to see events of national importance on free-to-air but also ensures that the fledgling pay TV industry remains viable," the spokeswoman said.</PARA>
<PARA>It is extremely hypocritical of the opposition to come in here and argue that, in some way, there is a problem with the anti-siphoning list when they are the people who argue that we are protecting too many events for free to air TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened with the West Indies negotiations? As the shadow spokesman says, it is correct that Australis did claim in July last year that it had the exclusive rights for the West Indies series. As I told you yesterday, subsequently they advised the Broadcasting Authority and me&mdash;we made inquiries with Australis within days of its July announcement&mdash;that an affiliate company, Prime Sports, had secured the international rights and that their licensee company, the company that holds the satellite licence, had not secured the rights. Then in January, Australis told us that they were wrong, that that licensee company had secured the rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting aside the question of whether or not the Broadcasting Authority and I were misled, the ABA is certainly still investigating whether or not the West Indies tour is covered by the list. They have told Australis that their preliminary view is that it is covered by the siphoning list. You have to give credit to Australis for behaving as if the event is covered by the list. And that is to Australis's credit&mdash;they have negotiated with Nine, they have offered it to other networks, both metropolitan and regional. That is the way the siphoning rules are meant to work, and that is the way this government intends to make sure they do work. So it is pretty hard to argue, as the opposition does, that in some way there is some crisis with the way the siphoning rules work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have I done in all this? On two occasions I have sought to break the logjam. These companies have been trying to negotiate these rights off and on now for three or four months&mdash;and, I have to confess, mostly off. Ten or 11 days ago, I tried to come up with a compromise that allowed Nine and Australis to reach agreement so the viewers out there can watch the cricket. Ten days ago I suggested a delayed broadcast of 12 hours. Certainly that was less than Nine asked for; Nine were after 24 hours. But it did not break the logjam, and the thing that was blocking the negotiations was Nine's request, demand&mdash;however you put it&mdash;for exclusivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people, particularly Channel 9, argue that they have to have exclusivity. This is rather hard to understand when you realise that there are already clear examples where precedents have already been set and different deals have been done with different broadcasters over a number of events. I will give you one example that I am sure is in the mind of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair): the New Zealand centenary cricket test. Delayed highlights were shown on Channel 9 but the live coverage was shown on Galaxy. The FA Cup in soccer, which I understand will again be shown live on SBS, will be simultaneously shown live on Galaxy. The netball world championships will be shown live on the ABC and live on Galaxy. I have been advised that the US Masters golf will be shown live on Nine and a delayed broadcast will be shown on Galaxy. All of these events are on the list. It is certainly clear there is obviously room for compromise by Australis and Nine to reach agreement on the West Indies tour, which is also on this same list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston is the king of the press releases. We get half a dozen press releases a day, a stream of consciousness&mdash;Senator Alston's views on this, that and everything else. But there is never any focus on the opposition's communications policy. We had an amazing article written by Senator Alston in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on the Opinion page last week, with Senator Alston saying, `unless Keating can overcome his micro-economic reform fatigue and slash transmission costs', he does not think Australia will get the benefits from the information superhighway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather hard to reconcile Senator Alston's urging that we should be speeding up micro-economic reform when it comes in the same week as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is running around saying that vague is best, that the opposition believes we should slow down the pace of micro-economic reform because there is too much pain out there in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also notice that Senator Alston is on the record as saying that he does not think that the government should be putting money into developing multi-media in Australia, into bringing together our creative industries, the people who are the best at making films and television programs, and our computer software programmers to generate Australian content for the superhighway. He does not think that the government should be involved in this area. He thinks that is picking winners and that is money down the drain. His obsession is with the cost of transmission on telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government remains firmly committed to encouraging and stimulating investment by the private sector in this very important industry&mdash;an industry that the commercial content report recommended will be worth billions of dollars by the turn of the century. Yet we have Senator Alston thinking in the old ways, saying that the only way you can develop any industry in this area is to lower the cost of telephone calls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In case anyone has not noticed, it was not the Liberal-National coalition party that broke up Telecom's monopoly. When they left government, we still had a 100 per cent government owned Telecom monopoly. It was the Labor government that introduced competition in telecommunications. It was the Labor government that resulted in STD and IDD calls falling by 20 per cent in price. It was the Labor government that reaffirmed that the duopoly between Optus and Telecom ends in July 1997. It is the Labor government that decided that in July 1997 we will move to full and open competition in telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we have from the opposition? What is their policy on telecommunications reform, micro-economic reform or any of these areas? `Watch this space'. You get lots of press releases from Senator Alston but you certainly get no indication as to whether he is actually going to say anything that is of relevance. There was a profile in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> back in April, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One parliamentary colleague believes that Alston's greatest weakness is his fondness for hearing his own voice.</PARA>
<PARA>And it quotes this parliamentary colleague:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem is that quite often he just doesn't know when to shut up and when to speak.</PARA>
<PARA>That says a lot about the shadow spokesman on communications&mdash;there is no focus. In Senate estimates we get a thousand questions from the opposition, many of them duplicated, which cost the taxpayer over $1 million to answer. Yet we get no focus from the opposition, no policies brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government remains committed to ensuring greater micro-economic reform in telecommunications in broadcasting. This government remains committed to ensuring that pay TV provides an increase in diversity in programming, and that Australians will continue to watch those sporting events such as the West Indies tour on free to air TV. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here is our Telecom mate. I was fascinated to hear the minister at the table say how the government has been prepared to break up the Telecom monopoly. He knows that when the government came into office it gave Telecom a 49 per cent interest in Aussat, which was the government instrumentality that ran the satellites. The whole basis of that was to destroy the alternative of having a reasonable satellite service around Australia. The government, yielding to pressure from Telecom, destroyed Aussat's opportunity to develop a reasonable alternative to the Telecom monopoly much earlier than would otherwise have been the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole problem with the chief whip, or whatever he calls himself, in this place is that he cannot forget his linesman background. The problem is that, within the first decade of Labor, Telecom destroyed the competitive opportunity in the communications area simply because it controlled Aussat, which controlled the satellite alternative. The minister for communications was very proud of the degree to which&mdash;he claims&mdash;as far as Telecom is concerned, it has broken up the monopoly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But look at what the cross-media laws have done. Look at what the 1987 changes to the broadcasting and television legislation and the 1992 legislation have done in terms of monopolies of media around Australia. Today, the effective owner of the most successful television network says he wants to own the second largest print media group. The largest print media proprietor is the largest shareholder in the second most successful television network. The two largest print media groups are controlled by foreigners, who are reliant on the government for any increase in their holdings. The third free to air commercial television network is effectively 57 per cent owned by a Canadian, despite a foreign ownership limit of 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national public broadcaster has just entered into a news and current affairs pay television joint venture with the second largest print media group&mdash;the Conrad Black outfit. That outfit is 25 per cent owned by a foreigner, although there is a 15 per cent foreign ownership law. The major shareholders in the two most successful television networks own in excess of 70 per cent of the magazine market, and the two dominant players in the media have entered into pay television joint ventures with the two telecommunication carriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that, under Labor, there has been a concentration of ownership in each of the media. There has been an increase in ownership from abroad. There has been a lamentable opportunity for people to have reasonable access to free to air television and to pay television, which has languished for more than 11 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pay television was one of the great achievements of the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins). He was responsible for successive collapses in the tendering process. It was a process in which he, in a deliberate way, failed to set down the terms and criteria which would allow reasonable predictability in the letting of the contracts and a reasonable opportunity for commercial development of pay television. Only one person was responsible: the communications minister's predecessor, the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The whole problem is that, yet again, the minister for communications is very much the lackey of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me more than anything at the moment is the way in which Labor is prepared to genuflect to the high and mighty in the media field. The tragedy of Labor is that it is not prepared to lay down firm guidelines&mdash;whether in print media, electronic media, pay television or the opportunities that should be available for free to air broadcasting. Today's matter of public importance was that the anti-siphoning laws the minister developed were developed after the event instead of before it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the only basis on which there is any claim whatsoever for Australis to have an opportunity to show the program. Sure, the minister says, `Yes, they are coming along and they are prepared to give a free to air television station an opportunity to show the programs in a way that might be negotiated,' but the circumstances should never have been allowed to develop. If anti-siphoning laws are going to be the basis on which an opportunity for showing free to air television programs is going to be preserved, those laws should have been developed before the licences for pay television were let.

If Channel 9 makes profits out of the broadcast of cricket in Australia, or the broadcast of an Ashes Series in England, it should cross-subsidise the profits out of those tours into broadcasting from the West Indies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the member for Goldstein and the right honourable member for New England were serious, they would take up the issue with Channel 9 because the onus is on it. The onus is not on government policy because there is no question that the minister's policy is sound, but we all know the opposition's policy is unsound. Senator Alston is on the public record saying he wants to see the anti-siphoning list shortened to make it easier for pay TV to pick up exclusive rights to events in the sporting arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same Senator Alston who wanted to see regional monopolies in the cabling being carried out by Telecom and Optus Vision. This is the same Senator Alston who wanted to transfer $6 billion to $7 billion of the asset value of Telecom over to Optus Vision. The coalition has no legitimate interest in competition policy or in the welfare of the Australian public and the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is really a bit of nostalgia for the members of the opposition. It takes them back to the Menzies era when the Liberals knew something about cricket. The tory Prime Minister would watch the cricket and make deals with his business mates similar to those now being forged between the Leader of the Opposition and Kerry Packer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It takes the opposition back to the Menzies era when the Prime Minister thought so much of public policy formulation that he dedicated a chapter in his memoirs to left-handed batsmen. It takes the opposition back to that lazy, indulgent, slothful era of public policy in Australia when the Prime Minister would sit down over a brandy with Reg Ansett and draw up the two-airline deal, dole out tariffs to the manufacturing sector, do deals with his business mates, regulate the exchange rate and close down the efficiency of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition really longs for the Menzies era. The member for Goldstein knows a lot about it, but he does not know much about communications policy or the pay TV regulations discussed in this debate&mdash;and he certainly knows nothing about cricket. You would not classify him as a cricketer's bootlace or having any prospect of doing well in any sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) has been raising the issue of wrestling. What about wrestling? Maybe the real interest for the member for Goldstein is a sport which suits him&mdash;it might be wrestling. Maybe he would like to see the wrestling on pay TV late at night instead of worrying about the cricket from the West Indies. Here we have a tag team duo from the coalition. We have Count Yorga and Gorgeous George out of retirement to debate these issues and show how the opposition has no decent appreciation of communications policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the debate, the coalition has exposed that it knows nothing about the anti-siphoning laws. It knows nothing about the substantial issues of cricket coverage out of the West Indies. I urge the honourable gentlemen to open the international rule book on cricket laws at page 96. There they will find a rule interpretation that perfectly sums up their contribution to this debate, their whole attitude to pay TV and communications: the law on hit wicket, because that is what they have done today&mdash;hit wicket. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before question time I was discussing the sole parent pension. It became obvious during question time that the government was very sensitive about this matter, and rightly so. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) was asked a question on this particular subject&mdash;a subject that was aired earlier in the week on Ray Martin's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>. The minister's defence of the government's position was quite pathetic. There is a concern in the community for the reasons that I incidentally outlined before question time that this particular social security benefit is too easily accessed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will repeat the figures. In 1980 there were 70,400 sole parents getting a benefit; in 1993 that figure quadrupled to almost 300,000. If the minister is not concerned about that, he ought to be. That is the sentiment being expressed in the community and on the Ray Martin program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister pointed out, and there is no doubting the figures, the number of young teenage girls becoming pregnant for the purpose of getting the pension is quite small. In the end I think he said that around three per cent of the recipients were teenagers. In that sense, it is not a huge number. But, even though it is small, it points to the problem that this has created. In the context of the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, which by and large is tightening up eligibility for a whole range of benefits, that is really eminently supportable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The youth homeless allowance could be classed similarly because a number of such benefits are, in effect, antifamily. The government was severely embarrassed and had to take action to redress the problem being created by young teenagers having arguments with their parents, leaving home and going straight down to the Department of Social Security, which welcomed them with open arms, gave them benefits, rent assistance and the whole lot. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has happened. The government knows it is true. It had to take action to fix that problem. I do not know to what extent it has been fixed. With respect to this legislation and the sole parent pension, notwithstanding my personal support for tightening up the availability of most social security benefits, the opposition has expressed concern that the government may be erring on the side of forcing women back to a violent situation in the home. Obviously, that is a legitimate concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some homes may be intolerable for a whole variety of reasons to wives or children. However, in my view it would always be better if money were directed towards helping keep marriages together rather than creating a situation where marriages are assisted to break up. In saying that&mdash;let me be quite clear about this&mdash;I have no sympathy at all with the sending back of women to violent homes. In fact, that is one of the concerns with this particular change to the legislation, and that has been expressed by the shadow minister. I believe that the sole parent pension has acted as an incentive for young women to have children out of wedlock. The minister admitted to that in his answer to a question today, although he said a small percentage&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You don't have to be blind Freddy to realise that. Everyone out there in Australia realises that the pension, as a result of the way it is structured, acts as an incentive. I do not know the extent to which that happens. The minister said that three per cent of the recipients of the benefit were teenagers. You can make what you like of that statistic, but the government cannot deny that a percentage of young women will take advantage of the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier I referred to reports in the newspaper about rorts and abuses of the social security system. I will not go over them again because they are on the record, but they are substantial. The reason for those reports and abuses is that a lot of benefits are easily accessed. The system is so complex that it lends itself to those sorts of abuses. I do not think the intention of the sole parents pension is to encourage young women to have children out of wedlock. I am not suggesting that even the government would want that to occur. But I am suggesting that situation is a product of that system. I do not think those in the community would disagree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the end, even in that situation, I do not believe people who have a particular need should be put out on the street. The point is made quite clearly, as it was on Ray Martin's program, that the availability of this benefit or any other benefit that is readily available to anyone who wants it actually creates a demand for such a benefit. That, unfortunately, is a product of the system that you have created. A welfare mentality now pervades the Australian community. You have created all these products and programs to solve problems that you have created. In doing so, you create a demand for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that welfare fosters dependency, and there is plenty of evidence that that has occurred. It has also contributed to family disintegration. In my view, the government ought to be putting money into programs which keep families together rather than facilitating in families breaking up, which is what it has been doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had a very wide ranging debate on the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, as has been exemplified by the contribution of the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford). He spoke a handful of words on the bill's content and spoke a lot of his typical rhetoric. He attacked the social security system and the recipients of benefits under that system. I took a point of order on this matter during his previous contribution and was assured by the Deputy Speaker that it was a wide ranging debate. Since I was given such a direction, my contribution on this matter will also be wide ranging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore have to take up the challenge of the honourable member regarding his comments on the youth homeless allowance and the supporting parents benefit. As we have come to expect, he never allows any facts or reality to stand in the way of his right wing rhetoric or his attacks on the recipients of benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> He acknowledged that, of all the supporting parents receiving benefits, only three per cent were in the teenage category. But then he said, `The government is still out there encouraging all these young women to have children out of wedlock.' I do not think he was in fact encouraging the concept of these pregnancies being immaculate conceptions; a lot of men were involved. You do not seem to recognise that some males have some responsibilities. You failed totally to acknowledge that this government has put in place a system through the Child Support Agency which is making sure that non-custodial parents are making contributions towards the welfare&mdash;something your party was never able to grapple with when in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have never acknowledged the fact that we have raised the percentage of non-custodial parents who are contributing to the welfare of their children from the 30 per cent that it was when your government was last in power to over 70 per cent now. You have failed to acknowledge that that is a major social policy reform which has reduced the burden on the taxpayers of this country and made the people who should be responsible for paying for the welfare of their children do just that. You also seem to misunderstand the whole purpose of the sole parent benefit, which is to support the children. You seem to want to make victims of the children in this process. You give no recognition to the rights of those children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government says it will not create a society with massive poverty, massive starvation and one in which thousands of people have to beg on the streets, as is the case in the countries that you probably hold up as great examples of social policy, like Thatcherite Britain and the way in which George Bush ruled in the United States. You hold them up as great examples. Yet, if you go to the cities of London, New York or Los Angeles, on every second street corner you will see mothers and babies begging for support because they do not have a comprehensive social welfare fabric within their society to make sure that all the people in the community are cared for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We provide a minimum level of support so that people can get decent housing, food and clothing to support their children. That is what our social welfare programs are about. In the attack from the member for McPherson, he also failed to acknowledge the fact that the best way we can deal with poverty in this country is to create jobs. This government has created over two million jobs since it has been in power. In the last election campaign we made the commitment to create 500,000 jobs in three years and those opposite attacked us and said it was a ludicrous aim and that we would never achieve it. But we have achieved 420,000 of those 500,000 jobs in the first two years. We will probably surpass our 500,000 target by tens of thousands. That is how to achieve the alleviation of poverty and help families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People on the other side of the chamber constantly claim that they are the family party; that they are the ones who will protect families. The member for McPherson raved on about his concern for families and about how our policies are allegedly destroying families. That is a load of bunkum. His party would reduce the opportunities for people to gain income support. It would launch an attack on the family living standards of hundreds of thousands of people who, often through no fault of their own, are sole parents supporting children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition policy at the last election was to take people off unemployment benefit after nine months regardless of their situation. It had a range of policies that would have slashed up to $10 billion from the social security budget. That would have attacked the quality of care and the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of Australian families. Yet those opposite do not find any inconsistency in their policy in that regard. They are quite prepared to attack poor families. They do not care about poor families and unemployed families. They have this notion of the perfect Liberal family. I suppose the first thing a family would have to do would be to vote Liberal to get any sort of benefit from you mob. They would have to be at the top end of town because only the ones at the top end of town would benefit from your policies. None of the lower or middle income families would benefit at all from any policy that the Liberal Party espoused in the last election, and more than likely will be espousing again at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us start talking about what is a true family policy. It is not one that attacks the total social fabric of our social welfare system. It is not one that attacks people because of their situation if they are single parents or unemployed. You have to start acknowledging that to achieve the policies that you want and that we want, which is to get people into jobs, you have to have job training programs. You have to do the types of things that we have outlined as a government in Working Nation. You have to have positive programs that get people into jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we came out with Working Nation those opposite attacked us for the waste of money it would be and said that we were fraudulently spending money on training programs that would not create any new jobs. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The fact is that we have created over 200,000 jobs since Working Nation came out. We have reduced the number of long-term unemployed people by the largest amount ever experienced in the last 20 years. That is what we have produced through the programs that were outlined in Working Nation, all of which the opposition opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has really got to start understanding that it cannot keep trotting out all this hyperbole about teenagers exploiting social security benefits and about homeless young kids just having a fight with mum and dad and then running down to the Social Security office to get a benefit. You know that is a total distortion. That is not true, yet you continue to peddle these myths and distort the realities of what these programs are designed to do. You are constantly attacking the victims in our society instead of trying to work out the real causes of poverty and hardship in our community and to put in place real programs to achieve improvement in the quality of life for all Australians. You cannot fix the problems by attacking the victims, which is your fundamental problem in all the policy recipes that you put forward to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us today continues to reform the social security framework so that it provides continuing benefits to people in our community in a properly structured and targeted manner. There are many positive initiatives in the legislation, as has been evidenced by the fact that few speakers opposite have made much of a contribution on the specifics of the legislation. All of the measures are sensible reforms and they amount to good news for the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the more significant measures included in the bill are the entrenching of the $1 increase in additional family payment in January 1995 into the AFP benchmarks; the introduction of employment and education entry payments of $100 and $200 respectively for recipients of the carers pension; extension of the carers' pension for a period of up to three months for those travelling overseas with the persons for whom they care; and the retention of fringe benefits eligibility for 12 months for customers whose disability support pension is cancelled because of earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one particular amendment that I am particularly delighted about and it is as a result of some very good work on the part of the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm), which is why we now call this clause the Deahm amendment. She put in some outstanding lobbying and presentation of the facts, figures and relevant arguments as to why this should occur. She deserves personal congratulations for the achievement of this amendment. The amendment exempts certain non-cash credits from the income test where non-income exchanges of goods and services are occurring. She has worked very hard. I also congratulate the minister for acknowledging the well-argued case that the member for Macquarie put forward and for introducing this amendment into the bill. So we support the Deahm amendment in this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe all these measures and the others in the bill will continue to improve the targeting of social security payments and improve the way in which the social security system operates. It provides additional benefits to carers. It provides additional benefits for family payment recipients and it ensures that the disability support pension operates in a more fair and reasonable way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to acknowledge that these types of improvements, which cost small amounts of money but provide major benefit to the recipients, could be achieved only under a Labor government because only a Labor government has an understanding of what the social security framework is all about and what social policy is meant to achieve. It is not meant to achieve, as we have been accused of by members opposite, a welfare mentality. The only group of people in this parliament which has a welfare mentality is the opposition, which does not understand the way social policy operates. It is only through a Labor government that we can have a progressive, fair and reasonable social security system that achieves social justice and equity throughout our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, as a member of this government, am proud to support this legislation and to debunk the myths and distortions that are peddled in this place by members opposite about the effectiveness of our programs and the purpose of our social security programs. I think we need to highlight a couple of points with regard to that, because we witnessed in this place and in the wider community earlier this year an attempt by the opposition to scare and to frighten hundreds of thousands of Australian recipients of a variety of forms of social security payments into believing that they were going to have those benefits cut dramatically. The opposition ran around this parliament, the media gallery and outside in the community peddling some list it had managed to purloin from inside the Department of Finance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that my colleagues are able to come into the House to support me on this. They know, like I do, that the opposition has engaged in some shameless tactics in the last few weeks by peddling lies around this parliament about alleged cutbacks that are going to occur in social security payments in this country. The stories it has been peddling have been designed for one reason only and that is to scare older Australians into thinking they are going to have their benefits cut and to scare people on disability benefits into believing that they are going to have their benefits cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a shameless act. It is a very shallow, transparent political act which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) exposed in this parliament with a letter from the opposition's media unit explaining the tactic opposition members should use&mdash;`Peddle whatever stories you want about cutbacks that we allege are going to occur in the budget so that we can scare people.' The opposition frightens people so that it can manipulate their views and manipulate their vote. It is a shameless act and it is something which I think reasonable members of the opposition should have rejected and should have challenged. It is not something that I believe any reasonable member of the Australian parliament should engage in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the only people in this parliament who would engage in massive slashing of social security payments are the members of the Liberal and National parties sitting opposite. They are the ones who went to the last election with policies that would have slashed $10 billion off social security payments, off welfare payments, for this country. They were the ones who were going to put in place measures that would have cut people off unemployment benefits after nine months and would have cut people off family payments after their children had reached the age of 12. They would have engaged in a wholesale slaughter of the social security budget. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I am going to deal with the points raised by those speakers as well as some of the points that have been raised by the honourable member for Berowra when he questioned some of the areas of concern, but before I get to that I really believe that some of the statements made by the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) would have to take the cake. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gone are the days when those girls were taken away in the dead of night to a supposed new aunt they had just found and buried away for the duration of the nine months, and then all of a sudden they would reappear because they had been into some area of training. Thank goodness we do not have that. But, because I was concerned that the honourable member did not understand or appreciate the answer the minister gave today during question time in response to a question asked by the government, I asked that some of the notes he had referred to be brought to me. I would like to repeat those notes not only for the speakers who have just made a contribution to the debate before the House but also for the honourable member for McPherson so that at least he might read them very slowly in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and take on board what the minister said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of the situation so far as sole parents, pensioners and unmarried teenagers are concerned is that it is the mature women and men who come onto the payment because of family breakdown or the death of a spouse. The average age of female sole parent pensioners is 33. Even for me who describes 33 as young, 33 is certainly not young teenage girls. Guess what? The average age for males is 38. Only three per cent of sole parent pensioners are aged under 20 years. There are twice as many male sole parent pensioners as teenage sole parent pensioners. So, any argument that the existence of sole parent pensioners is encouraging young girls to have children is certainly inconsistent with reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable member for McPherson was on his feet I was taking down some notes because I thought I would like to reply to him. A thought came to me&mdash;it just flashed; call it a vision, if you want&mdash;that we once had these ornaments of the three wise monkeys that sat on the table. The monkeys got up and said that they saw no evil, heard no evil, and spoke no evil. Well, after listening to the honourable member for McPherson I can only say that he is the reverse of that; he sees all evil, he speaks all evil, and he certainly hears all evil. In no way could one honestly get up as a true thinking representative of the people of this country and come out with some of the sayings that the honourable member for McPherson uttered during this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gone are the days when we could honestly say that, because of social security and welfare, we are breaking up families. That is what the honourable member for McPherson said. I would remind him that there are over five million payments of one description or another that go out from over 300 offices of the Department of Social Security right across Australia. Yet, every time he comes into this House to make a speech on social security, it is as though he has it in the bottom drawer and he has to rehash it and bring it out because this is the evil that the Department of Social Security and this government bestow upon the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to have contributions that are to be taken as serious contributions, all I can say to the honourable member for McPherson is that he either has to get his facts up to date or start really living in the land of reality and not in some airy-fairy conception or perception of what he sees life is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to respond to some remarks made by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the honourable member for Ballarat should say that there must be something wrong with the legislation because we continually change it. It is not a sign of a tired government, as he stated during the debate. I believe that it is more a sign of a concerned, caring government that takes on board the concerns of the people and makes sure that the legislation is amended to meet those concerns. In other words, we do care about people and we do change our legislation to meet the needs of the people.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to come back to some of the areas of concern that were raised by the honourable member for Berowra in his first speech on behalf of the opposition on this legislation. I would bring to your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when we first brought this legislation into the House it was non-budget legislation because a number of amendments needed to be made. At first we thought that they were going to be very general amendments, but it has created controversy, as social security legislation does for many people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first area of concern that the honourable member for Berowra raised was sole parent pensions. I know the honourable member for McPherson has raised this matter, but I would like to deal with the honourable member for Berowra who was far more rational and more concerned about clarification. I will answer his concerns. The purpose of the amendment we have before the House on sole parent pensions is really to clarify in the Social Security Act the principle that in a temporary situation&mdash;for example, if people are separated from their partners due to holidays&mdash;they do not qualify for a sole parent pension. The honourable member for Berowra mentioned people working on an oil rig in that connection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security has had legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department which confirms that the law requires clarification to put this principle beyond doubt in this legislation. That is what we are doing by this amendment before the House. We are putting it beyond doubt. The amendment itself does not seek to have any additional discretion and is certainly not involving any changes to existing procedures. We certainly are aware of the concerns raised about the impact of this clarification on people separating in circumstances involving domestic violence. However, these concerns are misleading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no intention in this amendment to change the current procedures or to put up any additional barriers to people needing to leave violent situations. When there is any question of violence, or other forms of abuse, there is immediate referral to a social worker service as a matter of course. Where a client is at risk and has left an abusive relationship his or her entitlement to a pension is usually very clear cut. In fact, our departmental people go out of their way to assist and help those individuals. The department, in administering the law, does and will continue to provide assistance to people at risk or who have sustained domestic violence. I suppose I am saying to the honourable member for Berowra that there was no undercover intent in what we are doing with this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. There was certainly a very, very clear direction given to us as to why we had to specifically spell it out in this particular piece of legislation. The other area of concern that was raised by the honourable member for Berowra is going to be covered by the government amendments regarding the 14 days notice, and I will be speaking more about that when we take this bill into consideration in detail. We will take into account the concerns raised by the Welfare Rights Centre. That organisation has also been to see the minister and the minister's office. I can assure the honourable member for Berowra that we listen to the other people outside. Sometimes we are accused of not listening enough. We also get the blame when we listen too much if we believe people have a point to make. Perhaps we should amend this legislation to take on board some of those concerns. I do not think that we can be condemned for listening and for putting into action the concerns of an organisation such as the Welfare Rights Centre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area of concern raised by the honourable member for Berowra dealt with the employment secretary of training; that it was not subject to review. I know that the honourable member for Berowra was concerned that the secretary's decision approving these payments should have a greater area of investigation or to allow&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Ruddock" NAMEID="0J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr Ruddock</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7T4">Mrs CROSIO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Supervision, yes. I would say to the honourable member for Berowra that funds are certainly limited. The Department of Social Security likes to direct funds to those in need. This amendment came out of a decision from the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. I went looking for that, and it was a case where an appellant to the appeals tribunal was a student doing a TAFE course. The TAFE course was attended by other people who were jobtrain participants. When that particular student became aware of the existence of the newstart training supplement he applied for the supplement, but was rejected, in accordance with the jobtrain guidelines. After consideration of the matter, the SSAT decided that the appellant satisfied the requirements of section 644(1) of the act and therefore should be paid the newstart training supplement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that DEET administers the jobsearch and newstart training supplements, but the employment secretary is responsible for decisions made under these provisions. The decision of the appeals tribunal would have major ramifications for the Department of Employment, Education and Training, and I believed that this was the appropriate area to have that amendment put in this particular act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area that I would like to touch on in the time left to me is the fourth area of concern the honourable member for Berowra raised&mdash;the disallowable instrument and the secretary's delegation. We had this very firm advice from the Attorney-General's Department: an instrument of delegation is purely an administrative instrument; only instruments legislative in character are suitable for disallowable instrument status; and the department is not aware of any other administrative instrument that has that particular status. I thought I would put that into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to answer the inquiries of the honourable member for Berowra. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7T4">Mrs CROSIO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You were a bit concerned about it. Another area where he expressed some concern was that of the seniors health card. I am sure all members of this parliament are aware that those cards are allocated to people not necessarily on a pension. The information required and the forms to be filled in are in line with all other actions taken by our department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can be accused of many things but I do not think we can be accused of not being responsible. The Department of Social Security, in the administration of the seniors health card, is required to be responsible and, therefore, certain questions must be asked of people applying for a seniors health card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final area of concern raised by the honourable member for Berowra, and which was also raised by the Welfare Rights Centre, was that of debt recovery. In most instances, a debt arises under the act only if payment were made as a result of a false statement or a failure or omission to comply with the act. The Welfare Rights Centre was concerned about the amendments in the bill now before the House and, in particular, the different objectives. I believe that it might have been a little misinformed about the objectives of our amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment was to put beyond any question the proposition that once a person loses qualification for a payment that he or she is receiving, that payment ceases to be payable. I think we are obligated to make sure that is clearly spelt out in the legislation. That is why that particular amendment is there. It is necessary because of some of the issues raised in the decisions of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not being uncharitable to the Welfare Rights Centre because it is certainly a very concerned organisation and very well informed. But, in its submission, while Mr Raper is objecting only to the very first proposal, he recommends that all amendments affecting the proposals be rejected. We believe that, irrespective of whether a person has done anything wrong, a debt will arise if payment continues after qualification is lost. But a person who notifies the department does not incur a debt during the notification period, and the amendment before the House preserves the effect of that. The act logically states that certain conditions must be met before someone may even qualify for payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to raise those points because they were the points raised by the honourable member for Berowra during the debate today. Again, I thank honourable members for their participation in the debate. Since many pieces of social security legislation will come before the House, I hope we will not have to listen again to the types of remarks made by the honourable member for McPherson and the honourable member for Ballarat.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the requirement that people attend for interview is not unreasonable. But to put that requirement on people, in relation to sole parent claims, immediately after a bereavement or a short time after a separation seems to me to be unreasonable even though it may have been regarded as a reasonable time. In some cases it may have been negotiated; in other circumstances it may have been a prescribed time that may have been seen to be reasonable but not negotiated, but it  could have been less than 14 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government's provisions had been because there was an absence of a requirement for people to attend interview and if they did not attend interview to be able to take action against them, that would not have met our objection. But the government was providing for a period of notice that was less than 14 days to require people to attend interview, particularly in the case of a bereavement, which seemed to me to be unreasonable. While it may mean that the government is without remedy here, I think that would be unfortunate in terms of the problem that it had identified. Perhaps it will have to look at that matter again.

<PARA>The government amendments are about debt recovery. The amendments are to make sure that the government's original intention is carried into legislation. The first element of the amendments concerns the period of grace that is being introduced when a person correctly notifies the department of an event or change in circumstances that causes the payment to reduce. It is being made clear that the new period of grace applies only to situations in which the event or change in circumstances causes a reduction in the maximum payment rate component of the person's payment. It does not apply to other components of the rate, such as the assessment of income or assets. The redrafted paragraph (e) in the relevant amendments will ensure that this happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element of these amendments makes sure that the new automatic rate reductions provision that will apply when a person correctly notifies the department of an event or change in circumstances is consistent with the equivalent rule governing automatic termination. In the same way that the department can manually terminate a person's payment during the period before an automatic termination comes into effect, it would be possible for the department to manually reduce a person's rate during the period before an automatic rate reduction comes into effect&mdash;for example, up to the end of a notification period. The new paragraph (f) in the relevant amendments will achieve this. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing here with a notice published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carer pensioners who are looking after severely handicapped armed service widows or widowers who transfer from a social security pension or benefit to income support supplement will lose qualification for carer pension if the current rule remains unchanged. This is because the caree is no longer receiving a social security pension or benefit or because a service pension is required under the qualification conditions. Similarly, carers who apply for a carer pension after 20 March 1995, and who are looking after severely handicapped armed service widows or widowers, and who are receiving an income support supplement, will not qualify for a carer pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is really an unintended consequence of the introduction of the income support supplement and is being rectified by these amendments. It was a request made to us by the Department of Veterans' Affairs when it was acknowledged that, unintentionally, some of those carers may not qualify. In addition, with the introduction of the income support supplement in packs on bereavement payment for carer pensioners, it is proposed that carer pensioners do not lose entitlement to bereavement payments because the caree receives an income support supplement. In effect, this means the income support supplement payments will be treated in a similar manner to service pension for the purposes of the carer pension bereavement provisions. As I have stated, this came as a recommendation from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I believe all members of this parliament support this, and this is the clause where we would like to have introduced it into the bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislative scheme that we are looking at here was put in place some time ago and this matter was overlooked. The government's intention was honourable. It wanted to ensure that people who were presently receiving payments through the veterans system and supplementary payments by separate application through the social security system were brought together so that they could all be paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. But, in doing so, some of the supplementary benefits that come through the social security system would have been overlooked. That, in simple form, is the problem we are dealing with. But you have to ask yourself: how is it that those who were dealing with these matters overlooked them at the time?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who is also at the table, is a parliamentary secretary as well. The changes are matters that the parliament has considered. The opposition, in its usual cooperative way, was facilitating the government's program for changes in relation to the manner in which the new job training allowance was implemented. There were also changes associated with jobsearch and newstart. In the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill, amendments were prepared to section 1241 of the Social Security Act to enable it to be applied to an adverse decision which would result in the application for a deferment period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time it was intended that a similar amendment be made to section 1251, because it similarly provides for the consideration of certain decisions which did not previously allow the exercise of a discretion. We were not mindful of amending certain other sections of the Social Security Act which the government wanted amended, without the capacity to exercise some discretion in the decision-making process in dealing with the circumstances in which people who were on benefits were likely to be excluded from benefits without some notice. This was largely because the welfare rights group not unreasonably had suggested that this created a problem. It was not satisfied that the present appeal provisions provided an adequate remedy. The purpose of this amendment was to provide that remedy. We provided one half of it. The agreement was, as I understand it, that both sections would be amended; but it did not happen.

<PARA>Let me add a couple of other comments relating to the way the opposition sees the administration of sections 1241 and 1251. First, we think it is important that people are aware of the implications of this decision in relation to internal review. We certainly believe that in the department's published guides, guides that are publicly available, this information ought to be included. We understand that at present in the Department of Social Security a separate review and appeals manual which is not accessible generally, even at regional office staff level, might include this information. We think it ought to be made more generally available. The parliamentary secretary might care to give us some undertaking on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we think that a comprehensive system to monitor and review the breaches and the new sections should be established. It is essential that after, say, three months and six months the department should report on the number and type of all breach decisions, the number of considerations under each section, the number of continuations of payment under each section, the length of continuations under each section and the reason for non-continuance decisions. In that context, we might well be able to judge the effectiveness of these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important for the government to be aware that we are concerned about the way these breach matters were to be dealt with and that people could be cut off benefits without being made aware that this was going to happen and that they could find themselves without income. These amendments were to ensure that people were not left in that position and that there would be an appealable decision which would reinstate benefits if they were taken away in such circumstances. It does provide for that but we also think, in looking at this matter, that it is important for there to be ongoing arrangements for proper monitoring. I hope the parliamentary secretary will be able to give us an assurance that this will occur. </PARA>

<PARA>I am pleased to present this bill which will clarify the operation and the scope of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 and will address some unintended consequences of this legislation. As you are aware, the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 received royal assent on 24 December 1992 and took effect from July 1993. Many of you were party to the passing of that legislation and will recall the act's objective:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to improve public health in this country by limiting the exposure of the Australian public to messages and images that may persuade them to start smoking or to continue smoking or to use or continue using tobacco products.</PARA>
<PARA>To this end, the act bans most remaining forms of tobacco advertising subject to a few limited exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the bill was considered by the House of Representatives, the member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), now the Speaker of the House of Representatives, stated in the second reading speech that `like powerful drugs, firearms and other legal, although dangerous, products, advertising of tobacco products should be severely limited.' The need for a ban on tobacco advertising has not waned over the 24 months since that bill was passed at Christmas time in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, we know even more about the harms caused by tobacco consumption now than we did then, as evidenced through a number of Australian and international reports including:</PARA>
<PARA>-Peto R. and Lopez A., et al, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mortality from Smoking in Developed Countries 1959-2000</EMPHASIS>, 1994;</PARA>
<PARA>-US Department of Health and Human Services, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People&mdash;A Report of the Surgeon General</EMPHASIS>, 1994; and</PARA>
<PARA>-National Drug Strategy, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">1993 National Drug Household Survey</EMPHASIS>, 1993. </PARA>
<PARA>From an Australian perspective:</PARA>
<PARA>-tobacco is the major cause of preventable death and disease in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>-tobacco consumption was responsible for nearly 19,000 deaths in Australia the year we passed this legislation, and has been responsible for a further 19,000 every year since;</PARA>
<PARA>-tobacco consumption costs our country approximately $9.24 billion each year in terms of health, social and economic costs; and</PARA>
<PARA>-tobacco consumption causes cardiovascular disease&mdash;this country's biggest health problem&mdash;and is the largest cause of cancer mortality in Australian males. </PARA>
<PARA>With one substance imposing such a significant burden on the Australian community, it is not surprising that all Australian governments support the national health policy on tobacco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pervasive nature of tobacco use in our society, its continuing appeal to a wide range of people and the available evidence on the health, social and economic costs of tobacco mean that parliament has a responsibility to take steps towards reducing tobacco consumption. Therefore, the problems associated with tobacco usage are addressed at a number of levels using many approaches, all of which together are essential to the success of the overall tobacco control strategy. The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 is an integral component of overall tobacco control strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the amendments before this House is to address a number of issues that have arisen during implementation of the legislation and, by so doing, clarify the operation of the legislation. Firstly, during implementation of the legislation and following consultation with key tobacco and health groups, it has come to our attention that the act may be interpreted to have a number of unintended consequences and unforeseen deficiencies. For example, the Commodore car could technically be interpreted to be a tobacco advertisement as it coincidentally bears the same name as a brand of cigarettes. Clearly, this is an unintended consequence of the act that the proposed amendments will rectify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the High Court has recently had occasion to give further consideration to the issue of an implied freedom of communication in respect of government and political matters under the constitution, an issue which had not been fully explored before the introduction of the act. In the light of the High Court's decisions, a thorough review of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 has been undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, it has been proposed that a number of amendments be introduced to clarify the operation of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 and to identify the exact bounds of the legislation in terms of the implied freedom. As an example, the act is not intended to stifle public debate on the question whether a legislative ban on tobacco advertising is itself appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the opportunity has also been taken to make technical and drafting amendments to facilitate the implementation of the act. I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are here today to consider a bill that really should not be here. The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act was passed by the Senate in the dying hours of the last parliament in December 1992, when the minds of members of this place were more on their re-election than on the legislation they were passing. In Labor's rush to get on the hustings an avalanche of legislation, including the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act, cascaded through this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we deal with some of the consequences of that rush. The intention of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill is to clean up a number of unintended consequences of the hasty consideration and passing of this act in 1992. These unintended consequences are so patently absurd that they have threatened to make the present act unworkable. They also make something of a joke of this government's claim to be a government of consultation and care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What makes this state of affairs even more amusing is that the government actually admitted that it got it wrong even before the original act became law. At the time of the Senate's second reading debate on the original act in the early hours of Tuesday, 15 December 1992, the now Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Bolkus, had to present a new explanatory memorandum because the original one, in his own words, `did not reflect some of the more recent changes to this draft bill'. It also contained typographical and transposition errors which actually contradicted the meaning of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is a pity that the government, with its horde of policy and legal advisers, could not see some of the patent flaws in this legislation&mdash;flaws such as: making it very uncertain whether a tobacco company can legally list itself in the telephone book or hire staff; affecting the sale of an unrelated product which has the dubious fortune to bear an identical or near identical name to that of a tobacco product; and possibly affecting the legal ability of a manufacturer to issue a recall notice in the event of a defective product. Then there is the real imperative for this bill; that is, casting doubt on the ability of the tobacco industry to advertise in the context of discourse on government and political matters, so long as the advertisement does not promote a tobacco product or products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In so far as this bill clarifies such anomalies the coalition does not oppose it but, in not opposing the bill, I want to draw the House's attention to the inclusion of proposed new section 4A to ensure that the act does not apply so as to exceed Commonwealth power. This is done with what could be called a `black is white' clause. The proposed section 4A says that if a provision of this act has an invalid application but yet can be constructed to have a valid application, an act or omission made on incorrect grounds can be assumed to be correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one area where the government has an advantage over ordinary citizens who have to take full responsibility for their actions, right or wrong. I am advised that legally this is a valid drafting device but, in other ways, it makes me wonder how nervous the government is about a tobacco manufacturer's current challenge to the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act in the High Court. In many ways, this bill is a product of that High Court challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government really wanted to make sure of the validity of its legislation&mdash;which had the support of the coalition on its original passage through the parliament&mdash;it should have taken some basic precautions, such as consulting as widely as possible in the preparation and drafting of the bill and allowing the parliament sufficient time to actually debate the legislation and scrutinise it in detail. Unfortunately, given the speed with which the original act was rammed through the House of Representatives and the Senate in 1992, it was not possible for that bill to be properly considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This failure on the government's part is all the more deplorable because of the importance of the subject of the bill, namely the broad principle, accepted by a majority of Australians, and accepted by the coalition, that smoking is a dangerous, noxious, addictive, carcinogenic and, for all too many people, a fatal habit which is the single biggest cause of preventable illness in this country. It is a habit and addiction that, in spite of all the available weight of medical evidence, and state and federal anti-smoking campaigns, young people are still taking up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's latest statistical report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Health 1994</EMPHASIS>, shows that on the most recent sex based data over 30 per cent of men and 27 per cent of women smoke. What alarms me, and should alarm all members of this House, is that the groups whose smoking rates are the highest are those from the ages of 16 to 35. The Institute of Health and Welfare statistics also show that 41 per cent of men and 38 per cent of women aged 20 to 24 are placing themselves in greater long-term risk of lung cancer, cardio-vascular disease, bronchitis, emphysema and a range of other potentially debilitating, life-threatening and, I might say, preventable conditions. Despite the community's best efforts, their numbers are still being supplemented by teenage and subteenage smokers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act is intended to make it as hard as possible to promote tobacco related products for sale, and the coalition supports that end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I finish, I just want to say a word about consultation on this bill. In the second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) talked of wide consultation with interested parties. I have some reason to wonder about this. My understanding, based on well-placed information, is that the government consulted little, if at all, before the introduction of this bill into the other place. There may have been consultation about the deficiencies of the original act, but not about the government's proposed remedies. It seems to me that the government, and its officials, have obviously not learned their lesson from the way the 1992 act was handled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, then, the coalition does not oppose this bill. But in not opposing it we note that the Philip Morris challenge of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act is still to be heard by the High Court, and that Philip Morris and the Tobacco Institute have made it clear that the challenge will proceed in spite of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has nothing to say about the challenge, or the grounds for it. But we will be watching its progress with interest. If the challenge succeeds, and the act is declared invalid, then it will be quite clear where the blame lies. If the government in 1992 had done its homework properly, and consulted widely before introducing it, the question of validity would have been beyond doubt. </PARA>

I wanted to put that on the record first because I know that, when I make some of these other comments, I am going to be accused of being a wowser and a complainer on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we are talking today about a bill which is designed to amend certain aspects of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act which came into effect in July 1993. I would remind the House that the objective of this original principal act was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to improve public health in this country by limiting the exposure of the Australian public to messages and images that may persuade them to start smoking or to continue smoking or to use or continue using tobacco products.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important aim and something I strongly support. I believe that, regardless of whether members are smokers or not, as the national legislators, as the people responsible for the care and welfare of all Australians, everyone in this parliament should support better health for all Australians. But as managers of the purse strings of this country we should also support the bill because, as outlined by the parliamentary secretary, tobacco and tobacco products cost this country $9.24 billion in disease, in loss of employment and in loss of earnings. So we have a fiscal responsibility as well as a health responsibility to all Australians to strongly support the aim of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) in the second reading speech, a number of unintended consequences have arisen out of the initial legislation which make necessary the proposed amendments in this bill. We also have to deal with some of the issues that are emerging from the High Court challenge. But this amendment enforces the spirit of the original legislation. It is clear that now, more than ever, we should increase our vigilance on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind members of the House of some of the statistics that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) outlined in her answer in question time on Monday of this week. For the first time in a decade there has been an increase in the number of young people who are smoking&mdash;a five per cent increase for girls and a four per cent increase for boys. Approximately 260,000 12- to 17-year-olds currently smoke each week, resulting in a cost of $1 million a week burnt up by those young people. In addition, around one-quarter, or approximately 25 per cent, of adult Australians currently smoke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past this government has introduced a range of initiatives to reduce tobacco consumption in Australia, and there have been some excellent programs. First, the `Smoking. Who Needs It!' advertising campaign was very effective and well targeted. It led the way on bans on smoking in the work force by preventing smoking in Commonwealth buildings. The government also extended the ban on tobacco advertising to include all forms of advertising on the broadcast media, including incidental advertising of tobacco products where the names of tobacco companies are used in the promotion of other sporting or cultural activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the other important initiative that the government took was to ban smoking on all internal airline flights and to encourage Qantas to gradually move in the international arena to ban smoking on all international flights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national drug offensive campaign conducted by the NCADA, the national campaign against drug abuse, has proven itself to be spectacularly successful in fighting tobacco, drug and alcohol abuse. I also support the actions of the Minister for Human Services and Health in her strong campaign against tobacco sponsorship of sport. We need to encourage that at all sporting venues. I understand that my colleague and friend the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) is going to speak a little bit further about a particular sporting event that is proposed for his home state and the use of tobacco there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly suggest that the government take further action. We have a reasonably strong strategy but I believe that, in order to tackle tobacco usage in this country, we need to make that strategy much stronger and much more comprehensive. I would like to suggest a number of further avenues. We have banned advertising in almost every form, but there are still insidious ways in which tobacco companies are able to advertise. I think we should move to make sure that a tobacco company cannot promote in any way or form whatsoever the name of the company or any of its products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should work with state governments to ensure that tobacco advertising is removed from every possible venue, such as sporting fields. Either up front or surreptitiously, tobacco companies should not be able to advertise their product during cultural events, in shops, et cetera. We need to do further work to ban tobacco advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My most important suggestion is that we push the price of tobacco products up to exorbitant levels. We need to make the price of tobacco products so high that no young people can afford them. If we do this most people will find smoking has such an impact on their budget that, regardless of the health consequences, for financial reasons, they will not be able to afford to smoke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline some points regarding tobacco excise. In the 1993-94 financial year, the federal government received $1.4 billion from tobacco excise. In 1994-95, this is expected to rise to $1.5 billion. The government receives $1.65 in excise on a pack of 35 cigarettes, and it receives 94c in excise on a pack of 20 cigarettes. For a 500-gram pack of roll-your-own tobacco, the government gets $3.37 in excise. I do not believe those figures are high enough. I do not believe they have a sufficiently punitive impact to stop most people. Evidence clearly shows that young people are still taking up the habit and are able to afford tobacco products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this year, the year in which we are seeking to find additional revenue to ensure that our deficit is reduced, that interest rates do not go up any further and that our economy is maintained on a sound economic footing, I believe that the government has a very sensible, reasonable and rational option: double the excise on all tobacco products. That is my very firm recommendation to the government. That would enable the government to raise an additional $1.5 billion in revenue. The price of a pack of 20 cigarettes would increase by almost $1. I would like to see us add another dollar to the price of a packet of cigarettes each year for the next five years. I realise I am taking a great risk here because 25 per cent of my constituents still smoke. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from evidence over successive years, such as budgets and a range of other activities, that putting the price of tobacco products up to a very high level has an immediate impact on demand and usage. Regardless of all the other strategies we employ, which I fully support&mdash;in fact, I would seek to have additional financial resources gained from this doubling of the excise duty committed to them&mdash;I still believe that the most effective means of stopping people smoking is pricing them out of the habit. That is the only real way we are going to get most people to stop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This strategy would have a number of benefits. Firstly, it would add an additional $1.5 billion to Commonwealth revenue. Secondly, it would make the price of tobacco products too high for a lot of young people and discourage them from taking up smoking at an early age. Thirdly, it would provide significant additional financial resources so we could more than double the amount of money we commit to the quit smoking campaigns, the advertising campaigns and the support programs we put in place in workplaces around the country to support people to give up the habit. I think we need to commit significant additional resources to those strategies. It would mean we could engage in major community education campaigns on a much larger scale than we do at the moment because we would have the additional financial resources to afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to work with state governments to thoroughly enforce existing laws. The only way people as young as 12 or 13&mdash;and their numbers are increasing&mdash;are able to smoke is if people sell them the product. Laws in all states prohibit the sale of tobacco products to people under the age of 16, yet tens of thousands of people under the age of 16 are regularly smoking and are regularly able to get access to tobacco products. Therefore, we need a very strong law enforcement campaign to make sure that shop owners, supermarket staff and others are not able to sell tobacco products to young people. Those initiatives will have a very strong impact on tobacco smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's programs already have a very good international record. We have led the way, and I have noticed that while I have been in other countries. I do not believe that antismoking campaigns in other countries are anywhere near as comprehensive as ours. I have noticed at meetings, conferences and forums overseas that quite an extensive amount of smoking is still occurring. It is allowed in meetings and conference rooms, but we do not allow that in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a very proud record in relation to programs to reduce the use of tobacco products. But the evidence now shows very clearly that these programs are not having the impact they had two or three years ago. We need to rethink our strategy, revisit the different ways we can have an impact and be a bit more aggressive in our campaign. The mechanisms I have suggested&mdash;the biggest and the one with the most impact is the doubling of the tobacco excise&mdash;will have an immediate and very positive impact on reducing the numbers of smokers in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tobacco is the major cause of preventable death and disease in Australia. Tobacco consumption is responsible for nearly 19,000 deaths in Australia annually, which is six times higher than the number of Australians who die annually in road fatalities. Understandably, we express enormous horror and outrage at the road carnage and the trauma caused by road accidents, yet we freely allow the sale and distribution of a product that we know kills six times as many people and costs the government of this country and the community $9.24 billion a year. </PARA>

Ignoring our responsibilities for the health and welfare of those working-class people and their families and not taking strong action is not doing the workers any good at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a government need to be taking very strong, firm action to tackle this issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The object of the legislation, we all know, is to prohibit tobacco advertising. Why do we have that? It has been said by a number of previous speakers, and it will be said by successive speakers, but it bears repeating: we need to prevent this particular advertising because it does damage, particularly to our young Australians. The argument from a medical point of view is one that is quite clearly accepted right across society. It is our young people in particular whom we have to try to protect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tobacco companies are continuing some of their advertising, and I believe the lengths to which they go are quite immoral. As I walk around my suburban electorate, I find it quite distressing to see the number of young girls smoking these days. They will pay for it in later life as, indeed, I have. We are spending billions of dollars each year in terms of the cost of smoking and it is not only the damage it does but also the repair to people's health that is needed, the hospital costs, the treatment of smoking related illnesses, and so on. I speak from experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things in my life that I am aware, and probably the least proud, of is that I smoked for many years when my children were young. It is interesting that when I smoked in the house my kids got on all right; they did not comment about smoking too much because they were quite used to it. They were brought up with it from birth. After I gave up smoking, as soon as a smoker left the house we were all running around opening the windows and trying to get some fresh air in. I noticed the difference, as did my kids. That was a graphic illustration that when I was smoking they were in fact passively smoking. I want to make sure that we discourage people not only from doing themselves damage but from doing other people damage as well. Particularly, I do not want to see the young influenced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in this place should all be outraged by the number of deaths in this country from smoking and smoking related illnesses. There should be no argument that we need the strongest possible legislation. We are told that the amendments to the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 are to clarify that the act is not to apply in a way which would exceed the Commonwealth's power and provide for the exemption of various types of tobacco advertisements from the operation of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those exemptions are to include advertisements made in the context of government or political discussion, so long as they do not promote tobacco products; advertisements relating to the internal management of the business of a manufacturer, distributor or retailer of tobacco products; advertisements preventing a product causing injury to anyone; non-tobacco products which share the same name or have substantially similar names to a tobacco product manufacturer, distributor or retailer; the publication of the name of a tobacco manufacturer, distributor or retailer in a telephone directory; and the broadcasting or publication of an advertisement on international air flights. It seems that they are all eminently commonsense matters that should have been legislated for in the first place. This legislation should never have come back here to be amended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable gentleman from Chisholm said, the timing of the bill has in all probability been brought on by the Philip Morris case&mdash;and I do not intend to go into that particular case in any great detail at this point in time. We have a real problem in this area: the government introduces legislation, does not talk to the outside world&mdash;the real world&mdash;gets itself into trouble and then has to keep coming back with amendments. We then have further court challenges, the government finds that it has not done its homework and we come back in here for further amendments yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope this time the government has done all its homework. It has the time because it does not need to rush things through on this occasion. It really is important that, on this sort of legislation, we get it right. As my colleague the gentleman from Chisholm said, we do not oppose it but it is another cleaning up exercise for the government. It is important that we all reaffirm our commitment to discouraging smoking, particularly the advertising for young people. As a former smoker who is admittedly worse off for having smoked, I commend the bill to the House because anything that can help prevent just one more young person from taking up smoking and suffering from it as I did is deserving of being passed through this place expeditiously. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I last spoke about the tobacco industry in December 1989 in the debate on the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisement (Prohibition) Bill 1989, so it was a while ago. It was a private member's bill that was introduced by Janet Powell, who was a Democrat from Victoria. At that time, I raised the issue of advertising by stealth in regard to the tobacco industry and what it was doing in the area of cricket&mdash;and this was in relation to Benson and Hedges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time, I said that over 40,000 smoking messages bombard the viewing public during an average test match. I would like to suggest a way to stop these ads getting through. I believe it would be feasible with today's computers to have all sporting broadcasts with cigarette advertising in them to be processed by a real-time system that would turn to some colour any item with the words `Marlboro', `Benson and Hedges' and `Philip Morris'. So when we have a close-up of a racing car driver with the words `Marlboro' or `Philip Morris' across his shirt, the computer would recognise them and, before they were transmitted to the public, diffuse the block of pixels involved to create a bland colour. This principle would also work for all the fence boards around our cricket ovals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this technology is capable of being developed in Australia by our software houses. To pay for it, the federal government could up the tax on cigarettes and have software firms work on it. To prevent their being nobbled by the cigarette companies, these software firms could be offered a prize of perhaps a million dollars for the first one to come up with the software. That way, many firms would be involved and not all of them could be bought by the cigarette companies. The government could buy a super computer to handle the software and processing and, when not in use by the TV networks, it could be used in our universities and by other bodies such as the CSIRO. This idea might sound a bit strange at first, but I believe that it could be put in place and that we could afford it through the method I have suggested. It is a novel idea, one which I have never heard before. I thought of it some time ago, and I hope that someone picks it up and carries it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also ban the export of cigarettes from Australia and put even more money into education to teach our children about cigarette smoking.

Hard drugs or opiates killed fewer than three Victorians every week. Road accidents killed nine Victorians every week. Alcohol killed 30 Victorians every week. Tobacco killed nearly 100 Victorians every week, which is about 14 per day.

At that time, back in 1987, it was a great victory for the caucus to win and be able to support Ron Edwards's motion.

I do not know anything about that, but, if the member wants to go down that track, we do not have to look too far to start painting the Australian Labor Party with the same sort of brush. The member talked about the caucus rolling the former Prime Minister in the caucus room. If he wants to go down the track of fundraising, what about the same man's having attended the famous gold lunch in Western Australia. The price tag for that little exercise I think was $250,000 per head. The Bonds and Connells of this world were there, all contributing to the Labor Party coffers. I do not need to draw the inference too broadly. If the member wants to go down that track, I suggest he take note of the old adage that people in glass houses should not throw stones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about this debate so far is that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and I have finally found, after five years here together, one thing on which we agree. That is quite extraordinary, as I am sure he will agree. That is that we are both pretty much confirmed anti-smokers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I came to this place I was quite alarmed to find that people smoked quite openly inside Parliament House. Senator Dr John Herron and I were concerned about this and subsequently raised it, which led to a ban on smoking in Parliament House. I did not make friends among some of my colleagues here who smoke, although I think perhaps I could observe that they may not observe the ban as religiously as they ought to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now find that, whereas we could go outside in the courtyards to get fresh air, we now have to stay inside because all the smokers are out in the courtyards. My next suggestion to the Speaker might be that he consider extending the ban to what I would call the environs of Parliament House. I do not want to suggest that that would force the smokers down on to the road in front of Parliament House, but I cannot help but observe, perhaps a little light-heartedly, that now that they are all smoking out in the courtyard we cannot go outside for fresh air because it is being polluted. It is a problem that I suppose somebody has to solve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who is well qualified to speak on these matters, spoke eloquently about the dangers of smoking tobacco&mdash;and other substances, I presume. He also made the point that deaths from smoking related illnesses are avoidable and that that is one reason why we should be very concerned about this. I also took the point that the honourable member for Moreton made that in grasping these issues enthusiastically we are likely to offend smokers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My experience in dealing with smokers is that most of them want to stop. My father, who smoked for a long time, tried on many occasions to give it up, but unfortunately he was too heavily addicted, or perhaps did not have whatever it takes to give it up. I note that some people have the extraordinary capacity to smoke a lot of cigarettes a day for a lot of years and then suddenly to give it up. Apparently that is amazing. Some of them can, but others obviously cannot. But I think that not many smokers, if they were honest, would say that they would not stop if they could. We meet the occasional person who does not agree with that point of view, but I really believe that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister has justifiably criticised the government for the fact that this bill is a result of the haste in which the original legislation was enacted. There is certainly justification for that criticism, as yet another piece of legislation is before us as a result of, to use the words of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), a number of unintended consequences. That is the excuse the government gives when a lot of legislation that is rushed through this place for one reason or another results in further legislation to correct a number of drafting mistakes or so-called unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose in this case there could be an argument for some urgency. If we are committed to the reason for the legislation, then I guess we would have to concede an element of urgency about it. This legislation is substantially because of the Philip Morris High Court challenge to the 1992 act. This is a response to the concerns of the tobacco industry about freedom of speech. As I understand it, even the Australian Medical Association and other medical authorities have conceded that these changes are in order. The amendments give tobacco companies rights to do things, as I understand it&mdash;to use their names in job advertisements and those sorts of things. So in that sense we have to concede that there were unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like, I would think, all speakers here, I have never had any doubt about the intention of tobacco companies to use advertising to encourage people to smoke. The arguments that they were doing otherwise were always specious. They were so glaringly, obviously so that I could not imagine people from the Tobacco Institute writing to me or standing up in public to try to make a case that their advertising was intended only to affect brand loyalty and arguments along those lines, which clearly was not the case. In fact, I think they must have thought most people were stupid if they thought that they would take that sort of argument seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tobacco companies always intended to make smoking acceptable and to encourage people to take up smoking. That has always been their intention. Even in recent times they have shown a great capacity to be original. I have noticed their latest attempts to promote smoking with all sorts of value added promotions, retailer loyalty programs and the like. In the end the government may well have to look at preventing these sorts of activities, which may already be in breach of state laws. State jurisdictions, no doubt, will be looking into them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is evident that the Philip Morris challenge will continue despite this legislation. Of course nobody denies that it has the right to take action in the High Court, but it does in a sense indicate the level of concern that tobacco companies must have about the future of their business. I for one certainly hope it will not be successful in its High Court action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question often posed, quite legitimately, is: if smoking is so dangerous, why is it not banned? You would think from hearing the fervent speeches made on this subject here today that there would be some people calling for the banning of cigarettes as a product. From listening to the speeches that have been made, it would be almost logical if that were to occur. I think the answer is largely self-evident&mdash;prohibition will not work. I suspect it would substantially be in the area of cigarettes, but in the end it will not work to the extent that it perhaps needs to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should have been banned a hundred years ago or whenever it was that Sir Francis Drake took the first puff. It would have been banned then if they knew what we now know about it, although I am not sure that we learn lessons quite that way. With the calls for the legalisation of marijuana and some of those other substances evident around us, hopefully we will not be silly enough to go down that track when the dangers of smoking, inhaling or the taking of those sorts of substances are not entirely certain one way or the other at this stage&mdash;depending on who you talk to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the answer is in education, although, unfortunately, because of the incidence of young people taking up smoking, that does not appear to be working as well as it should. It probably takes time. I firmly believe that education is an important component. All of our children's children should be very clearly taught about the dangers of exposure to tobacco, drugs and such products. My own children, for instance, attend our local Life Education Centre, which does an excellent job. I observe in passing that its funding was reduced. That was a matter that came up in the budget debate. The Life Education Centre does a very good job&mdash;certainly the one on the Gold Coast does&mdash;in teaching kids about the dangers of smoking and other drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will just take time and determination to use the education process. We are beginning to make some impact on kids with warnings about the dangers of skin cancer, for instance. A lot of educational material has come out, and a real concern about skin cancer is starting to emerge. Kids are wearing hats, using sunscreens and are obviously aware of the dangers of exposure to the sun. That has come through education. I believe strongly that education is still an important component in stopping young people smoking. When they eventually get the message that it is not cool to smoke&mdash;the reason they take it up is that they think it is cool&mdash;then we will start to see the trend going in the other direction. The sooner we do the better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other element in the equation is obviously pricing. The member for Moreton went a little bit over the top when he called for a doubling of excise in the 1995 budget. The rationale he had for that was an economic one. He went to great lengths to point out that, if excise was doubled, it would raise so many billions of dollars&mdash;I have not got the figures at my fingertip&mdash;and help the government with its deficit reduction strategy, which no doubt it would. The fallacy of that must be that, if it has the desired effect of stopping people smoking, it surely will not double the excise. If we are going to use the price mechanism&mdash;there is no doubt that every time you make cigarettes more expensive some people give up smoking&mdash;there is certainly a point on the demand curve where you will virtually stop people smoking. The purpose ought to be quite clearly not to raise revenue. If it raises more revenue, then it certainly is not having the desired effect of stopping people smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other option and part of the armoury, if you like, of ways of attacking this problem is prohibition on advertising, which we are talking about today. I and the speakers that have taken part in the debate are certainly committed to that. It is one of a range of options, the three main ones being pricing, education and prohibiting advertising. The three of those combined eventually, hopefully, will have the desired effect of stopping people smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I like to give credit where credit is due and I give it to you, Mr Speaker, because I remember in the debate that took place in 1992 that you reluctantly ended up strongly supporting the original legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To enlarge on the argument that legal substances should be allowed to be advertised, clearly there are plenty of legal drugs that are not allowed to be advertised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I foreshadowed earlier, for decades we were told that cigarettes were not bad for health. Many soldiers took up smoking during the war when they were actually given cigarettes, and many have since died from smoking related diseases. I was interested to find in doing a bit of research for this tobacco bill that the Menzies cabinet actually had been warned about the dangers of smoking as far back as 1963 when it rejected bans on tobacco advertising. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1963 Cabinet papers, made public today, show that the minister for Primary Industry, Charles Adermann, succeeded in knocking back recommendations from the National Health and Medical Research Council for bans because it would be "detrimental to the Australian [tobacco] leaf industry".</PARA>
<PARA>Far be it from me to go too far down the track of attacking the Menzies' government&mdash;you can understand that, Mr Speaker&mdash;but it seems to me that, if it had actually done the right thing in 1963, a lot of the 20,000 people who die each year from smoking related disease would have lived at lot longer. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the national forest policy statement of 1992, which has been signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and all premiers and chief ministers, article 4.5 asserts that all Australian governments will continue to encourage plantations.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To achieve the governments' objectives it will be necessary to ensure the impediments to plantation development are minimal in areas such as taxation, planning and access to information.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major problem relates to the management of tax rulings by the Australian Taxation Office. The ATO now refuses to provide private tax rulings for afforestation projects, whereas previously it did. The reason for the ATO not providing a private ruling is that it now refuses to provide rulings for primary industry production projects. This has the potential to cripple moves towards a plantation, and thereby renewable, source of timber products. </PARA>

There is, however, an ATO public tax ruling on afforestation projects known as IT360. IT360 is under review and the Australian Taxation Office refuses to provide private rulings. So, what are companies that are considering afforestation projects to do?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an industry where it takes up to 12 years for a plantation to grow to maturity and be ready for harvesting. This is a very long lead time before any income is derived. It is essential that there be certainty as to what expenses are deductible.

It is the government's responsibility to send out a clear message that it supports plantation forests. Rhetoric is one thing, but there is no substitute for action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I spoke in this place last year concerning the threat to sell off the Port of Geelong by the Kennett government. That threat is now being realised by the Geelong community. The Kennett government wants the port in private hands&mdash;and the cash in its&mdash;by the end of this year. Opposition is building and, as I rise to speak in this House tonight, the Geelong community and the union movement are gathering to discuss further means of opposing this privatisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sell-off of Geelong's port, possibly to foreign interests, has outraged and united the Geelong community as never before. Unions, port users, business groups, community groups and Labor politicians have all voiced opposition to this decision by the Kennett government. That is because the Port of Geelong is central to the city in many ways. It is the city's geographical heart, a central transport link, a core economic asset and our link to the export markets of Asia and the world. Yet, despite this centrality to Geelong, the Kennett government has told the community that it will auction the port and its related assets to the highest bidder&mdash;a pointless plundering of the assets of the community that denies it any involvement in the management of this public asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kennett government's economic rationale for the sale is simply its privatisation mantra that private ownership will improve efficiency and cut costs. However, the Port of Geelong already has the runs on the board or, should I say, the ships in the port. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I told the House in May this year, the federal government embarked on an ambitious restructuring of the waterfront in 1984. That three-fold process of overhauling stevedoring employment arrangements, implementing port authority reforms and encouraging greater competition in the industry, has had a large impact on our waterfront. In Geelong, it has transformed the port into a profitable and efficient asset that is competing well on the world stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Productivity has improved by some 120 per cent. The port is one of the most efficient grain handling ports in the world. Cargo handling rates have risen by 57 per cent. Ship turnaround times at container terminals have been reduced by 45 per cent. The port returned a $9.6 million profit last financial year and has reserves of some $44 million. That is why the Kennett government wants to get its grubby hands on this community asset. While I regret the loss of jobs, manning levels have been reduced through voluntary redundancies by 50 per cent, and the work force has been multiskilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kennett government's response to the port's success has been simply this: `Here is a successful community asset; let's flog it to our mates.' All the while it is telling the community that the port is so inefficient that only private interests will be able to deliver the further efficiencies and cut costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community simply is not buying it. There has been a chorus of opposition from business, unions, the local media, the port authority and the community generally. The business community is bitterly divided over the sale. Longstanding opponents have been bullied into acquiescence by the Premier, but in private they are expressing to me their bitter opposition to the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union movement is united in outrage at the sell-off plans. It has played a very constructive role in the corporatisation of the Port of Geelong. The workers have helped make the port an efficient community asset only to see it sold from under their feet by the Kennett government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Waterside Workers Federation in Geelong for the constructive role it has played, especially its secretary, Jimmy Mavity. It is that group, showing concern for its community, that is rallying tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reorganising Board for the Port of Geelong has also expressed its opposition to the port sell-off. When the government announced its decision on port reform in late January the reorganising authority stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's plans appear to fly in the face of the advice given to it, both by the Reorganising Board and those who participated in the consultative process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much. I am flattered. The circus has contacted me because of its very grave concern about its future. Its future is in doubt because the Commonwealth has not so far responded to the plea of the circus for funding arrangements with the Commonwealth. I am told that the circus is facing a reduction of 60 per cent in Commonwealth funding unless the matter is clarified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give an idea of the success of this organisation and the dimension of the funding involved compared with other organisations, in 1994 the Australian Opera, which I support very strongly, performed to approximately 300,000 people in Australia. In the same year, the Flying Fruit Fly Circus performed to 248,000, which is 80 per cent of the opera's audience. In the same year, the Australian Opera received $7,700,000 funding from the federal government; the Flying Fruit Fly Circus received $90,000, which is 1.16 per cent of the opera's funding. It is that $90,000, believe it or not, that is in doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been told by the directors of the Flying Fruit Fly Circus, which has been operating in Australia now for 15 years with great success and international recognition and acclaim, that if the Commonwealth does not respond to the submissions that have been made about funding and does not continue the funding of around about $90,000, the circus will have to close. It will be lost to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that this brief summary, because of time constraints, will be heard by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the other relevant ministers; the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), whose department has had a long-standing partnership with this organisation because it is also a training organisation. It helps train young Australians in theatre, the arts&mdash;particularly in acrobatic arts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude by saying that this great national treasure is helping young people achieve excellence. It has travelled the world and been recognised and acclaimed. I remember very well when I was patron of the organisation in its early days that it went to Canada. As a result of its performances in the World Children's Circus, it was acclaimed as the best, and NBS television filmed it. They thought they would show it once in America through cable television and that would be it. Because of the demand, it was shown constantly by NBS cable television in America, and the circus has been invited back and has been back to that country on, I think, two more occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It performs across regional Australia and in the capital cities. I would like to have a performance in front of parliament one day, but I do not want to turn these kids into a stunt. They are too good for that. I would like this parliament and the Prime Minister on a non-party political basis to act quickly and urgently, because this is the first time in the 15 years that I have been associated with this circus that it has ever made a plea like it is now. It is not kidding. If it cannot get this $90,000, it is finished, and that would be a shame. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak on Hilmer's competition policy, especially in relation to the NRMA. My understanding of the Hilmer competition policy is that it is designed to get the best possible competitive vehicle for economic activity within the country. We have seen things which I am a little dubious about in the Hilmer being pushed through COAG to cover areas like water, such as has happened in the Victorian electricity industry. Are schools to be next? In Western Australia I understand health has been put forward for that. Prisons, in some instances, have been put across.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is of desirability. I have my reservations about those things and I have expressed them in this House before. Accepting the premise of competition policy that an organisation which is best suited in a competitive economic framework will survive and will do the best, I turn and look at the mutualised society of the NRMA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is behind these con artists in the president's team who turn around and suggest that they are motivated by the need to unlock those vast resources of the NRMA and get them out to the members? Some of the opponents of their philosophy suggested that the best way they could unlock those resources and get them out to the members was to give refunds, rebates or lower fees on the insurance premiums they charge. The answer that came back from these intellectual giants was, `No, we can't do that because, if we did, that would destroy the insurance industry. All these other companies would fall by the wayside. They would not be able to compete.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find myself in a very difficult position, then, if I accept what Hilmer is supposed to do&mdash;that you find the most competitive vehicle within any one industry and back that to the hilt, that you allow competition to take its ugly course and whoever comes up on top, whoever is the most appropriate body, is the one to have pre-eminence. But here the directors of the NRMA are saying, `We can't do that. We can't have competition because if we had competition all the other insurance companies would go broke.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My question is simply this: if it is so desirable to get least cost delivery of service, then in this case would it not be in the best interests of the motoring public of New South Wales, would it not be in the best interests of the business and small business sectors of New South Wales, to have the cheapest possible insurance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard all the arguments about water, electricity and so on, relating to how they are going to do these magnificent things for the people in the communities and small business in New South Wales. Quite frankly, I doubt it. But accepting that, I look at the insurance premiums people pay out in small business. I refer to small business, but the same applies to householders in terms of their household and car insurance. If electricity is going to deliver some benefits then, in dollars and cents terms, lowering those insurance premiums would do a hell of a lot more for small business and for the people in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of you understand that I am telling you the exact truth. So why under Hilmer do we have any consideration for assisting the demutualisation of this organisation? Why not put Hilmer in there? The GIO has gone and I cannot see much more competitiveness in New South Wales in the insurance industry. The real reason behind this is that this is a theft of the mutualised members' assets. They are going to pay 50c in the dollar to the assets of the NRMA and those mutualised members and the historic members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to go down the path of Hilmer, let us do it correctly and not say, `Hold on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the bill is to begin the process of codifying Commonwealth criminal law. The bill contains chapters 1 and 2 of a new criminal code. During the next five years the code will be systematically built around these chapters. Chapter 2 is the most fundamental part of the code. It contains the foundations of the new Commonwealth criminal law&mdash;the general principles of criminal responsibility. By the end of five years, these principles will apply to every federal offence unless there is need to vary these by reason of special considerations applying to particular offences. When this is achieved, for the first time since federation, those accused of federal offences will be dealt with under the same principles&mdash;no longer will people charged in different states and territories be treated differently from one another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This step is long overdue. It is partly a recognition that the Commonwealth criminal law has grown enormously since federation. Indeed, in 1914 when the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 was first enacted, most of the criminal law was contained in the Crimes Act and the Customs Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in 1914 an attempt was made to adopt common principles of criminal responsibility by section 4 of the Crimes Act, which provided that common law principles of criminal liability applied in relation to Crimes Act offences. Since then Commonwealth criminal law has grown like a vigorous vine, branching out into topics such as the environment, health, heritage, insurance and banking, and offences which ensure meeting of our international obligations. Now most offences are found outside the Crimes Act. This means that in most cases the principles of criminal responsibility that apply vary from state to state because they are picked up from the local state and territory law under section 80 of the Judiciary Act 1903. This is unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Codification of the criminal law has its roots in the work of the 18th century jurist Jeremy Bentham who, speaking of the English common law at that time, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you know how they make it? Just as a man makes law for his dog. When your dog does anything you want to break him of, you wait till he does it, and then you beat him for it.</PARA>
<PARA>While the common law has come a long way since then, and the principles are more certain, Bentham's comment may seem to reflect the way the general principles of the criminal law are applied to anyone who travels from one Australian jurisdiction to another. A person might live in Tweed Heads, New South Wales and make a 10-minute trip to Coolangatta, Queensland. In many cases that person would be surprised to know that in relation to the commission of the same federal offence markedly different rules apply. These differences are significant&mdash;in some cases they could be the difference between conviction or acquittal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem has become more significant now that we have such a mobile society. Australians are becoming more and more involved in business and recreation which takes them to other states and territories on a regular basis. No longer are the differences in the law just an inconvenience for those who live in the border towns of Tweed Heads and Coolangatta and Albury-Wodonga. Indeed it also impacts on those who are involved in international trade with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These problems were first addressed in the July 1990 report of the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs GCMG, AC, KBE, our former Chief Justice of the High Court. The Gibbs committee, which also included the Hon. Justice Ray Watson and Mr Andrew Menzies AM, OBE, recommended that there be general principles of criminal responsibility for Commonwealth law, and planted the seed of what became a national initiative to standardise the foundations of the criminal law across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State and territory governments were quick to take up the challenge and, at the same time, began to participate in the development of the general principles of criminal responsibility and other provisions for a model criminal code. Indeed, it was the state and territory governments who initiated the idea of a model criminal code for Australia. The Northern Territory Attorney-General, Mr Daryl Manzie, suggested that the issue be placed on the agenda of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and, out of that, the Criminal Law Officers Committee was established&mdash;now called the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee&mdash;made up of criminal law experts from each jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was remarkably successful at developing consensus on general principles, in a process that, building on the work of the Gibbs committee and the consultation it had undertaken, drew even more widely on contributions from the academic and legal professional community. There has been the most extensive consultation towards the drafting of this bill and through its consideration before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that all parties represented on the Senate committee supported the bill and the concept of uniform criminal law. The committee made the very important observation that compromises were necessary if national uniformity was to be achieved, and concluded that it was satisfied that the Criminal Code Bill `provides a thorough, workable, logical and balanced compromise between competing legal policy views, and perhaps more importantly, between the competing interests of the State and of the people, which lies at the heart of the criminal law.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that the approach of the premiers and chief ministers of the states and territories who have given their personal support to the development of the model Criminal Code is being reflected in this parliament. This bodes well for the implementation of the model Criminal Code by the year 2001, as agreed by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The Model Criminal Code Officers Committee has worked long and hard to turn the concept of a model Criminal Code from theory into reality. I am pleased to say that I have been able to initiate the first legislative step which has made it a reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has a very wide range of offence provisions to amend consequentially. The magnitude of this task should not be understated. Many serious offences with a number of elements will have to be examined. If the standing committee's target is to be met, the Commonwealth must start now. In this, I hope to initiate a dramatic improvement in the Commonwealth statute book, and also to show commitment to those state and territory governments who have invested their time and resources in the development of the model Criminal code. This project is a very significant demonstration that federalism can work in Australia. As such, I believe it is a fitting project to contribute to our celebration of the centenary of our federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the provisions of the code before the Committee. It is to be noted that these blend the two main approaches to the criminal law in Australia. On one hand, the code contains subjective fault-based principles of criminal responsibility which reflect the approach of the common law jurisdictions while, on the other hand, it has provisions&mdash;such as those relating to intoxication&mdash;which are closer to the approach of the Griffith codes. Furthermore, it is a code and, as such, it accepts the underlying philosophy of the Griffith codes that, in such an important area of the law, parliament should determine the appropriate principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In setting out the physical and fault elements of offences and instances where fault elements do not apply, part 2.2 adopts the usual analytical division of the elements of criminal offences into `actus reus' and `mens rea'. The `physical elements' may be conduct, or the circumstances in which conduct occurs or a result of conduct. The `fault elements' refer to the state of mind of the person. It is in relation to the fault elements that the Griffith codes and the common law have taken different approaches. The essential difference between the two systems is that criminal responsibility under the common law is based on subjective fault elements: what the accused knew, believed or intended at the time of the conduct. This is not so under the basic provisions of the Griffith codes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many offences under the Griffith codes, one or more forms of intention are express elements of the offence. In these cases, the difference between the Griffith codes and the common law as regards intention is less marked. Nevertheless, in the case of many Griffith code provisions which do not specify a fault element, the difference is more significant. There is no onus on the prosecution to prove a fault element, and criminal responsibility can only be negated by the defendant raising accident, or honest and reasonable mistake, or that the event occurred independently of his or her will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the common law jurisdictions, if a fault element is not specified for a serious offence, the general rule is that a fault element such as intention or recklessness is to be implied, and that the prosecution must prove it as part of its case. The code follows the common law approach in specifying subjective fault elements. This was the preferred approach in the vast majority of submissions received on the model Criminal Code, and is consistent with the US model penal code, the English draft code, the Canadian draft code and the Gibbs committee recommendations. It strikes the right balance and strengthens the principle that the accused is innocent until proven guilty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General preferred the general approach of the Griffith code in relation to intoxication. The code provides that evidence of self-induced intoxication may not be taken into account in determining whether the conduct was voluntary and that it cannot be considered in determining whether a fault element of an offence of basic intent existed. An offence of `basic intent' is an offence where the physical element is one of conduct alone, such as striking a person, rather than one requiring greater awareness, such as striking a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. This approach is similar to that in the law in the USA and England, but differs in some situations from the law in the common law jurisdictions of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory, which follow a High Court decision known as O'Connor. In those jurisdictions gross intoxication can be taken into account in determining whether a person had intent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the view of Commonwealth and the unanimous view of state and territory Attorneys-General that legislation to enable intoxication to be used as an excuse for otherwise criminal conduct in relation to simple offences of `basic intent' is totally unacceptable at a time when alcohol and drug abuse are causing so many social problems. It is the Commonwealth's view that if a person voluntarily takes the risk of getting intoxicated to such a degree then he or she should be responsible for actions which would otherwise amount to an offence of basic intent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2.3 describes circumstances where there is no criminal responsibility, such as where a person: is under 10 years of age; suffers from mental impairment; is involuntarily intoxicated; is under a mistaken belief; or has a claim of right. Also covered are situations where there is some intervening conduct or event such as duress, emergency or self-defence. Apart from intoxication, which I have already mentioned, the most difficult issues concern mental impairment and self-defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach taken in relation to mental impairment follows the basic principles of what is called the McNaghten test. The code provides for a mental impairment defence primarily concerned with the determination of criminal responsibility: a legal rather than medical test. This issue must depend in part on the expertise of psychiatrists and psychologists but is not exclusively a medical issue. The approach adopted has produced a workable definition of mental impairment that allows the jury to hear relevant psychiatric testimony, based on the best scientific evidence, and properly leaves the ultimate question of responsibility to the jury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The self-defence test is subjective as to the necessity of using force but the test as to the proportion of force used is objective and is similar to section 45 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code. Although not of great practical relevance to federal offences, revision of the law of self-defence is very important in state and territory legislation to which the same principles will apply. In this connection the approach taken in proposed section 10.4 should be noted. Attention is directed to the explanatory memorandum which examines how the issue of the so-called `battered women's syndrome' has been dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2.4 of the code deals with extensions of criminal responsibility such as attempts, complicity and common purpose, innocent agency, incitement and conspiracy. Each of these extensions raise interesting issues which are dealt with in detail in the explanatory memorandum. The most notable change relates to the offence of conspiracy where measures have been included to avoid it being overused. This includes a limit that the offence only applies where the offence to which it relates has a penalty of more than 12 months imprisonment or a fine of $20,000 or more. It also requires an overt act on the part of one of the parties to the agreement which forms the conspiracy and that proceedings only be commenced with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. This addresses judicial and other criticisms of the use of conspiracy charges in recent decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2.5 deals with the important issue of corporate criminal responsibility. It sets a basic standard of responsibility for bodies corporate in relation to general offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The code introduces the concept that criminal responsibility should attach to bodies corporate where the corporate culture encourages situations which lead to the commission of offences. The provisions make companies accountable for their general managerial responsibilities and policy. It provides that negligence may be proven by failure to provide adequate communication within the body corporate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking about this part I must stress that it is still open to the legislature to employ reverse onus of proof provisions or strict liability for offences where the normal rules of criminal responsibility are considered inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the federal level this will need to occur in a number of important areas where corporations are the main players, such as environmental protection, where the potential harm of committing the offence may be enormous and the breach difficult to detect before the damage is done. For example, the government is not planning to water down the requirements of section 65 of the Ozone Protection Act 1989 in regard to the matters covered by that act. Part 2.5 concerns general principles suitable for ordinary offences. It will be the basis of liability if no other basis is provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, part 2.6 deals with proof of criminal responsibility and sets out the respective burdens of proof to be discharged by both the prosecution and defence. It also deals with averments and restricts their use. It follows established principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly there are different views on particular issues, in some cases very strongly held, and the government will take particular care to listen to the debate on those aspects of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by saying that for constitutional reasons later parts of the Commonwealth Criminal Code will be different from the new state and territory criminal codes as its subject matter will include what are currently Crimes Act 1914 offences and certain other serious offences such as drug offences. Despite this, the offences common to the Commonwealth and state codes will be expressed in substantially the same terms and offences unique to the Commonwealth Criminal Code will be constructed having regard to the same principles of criminal responsibility contained in this bill. Once the legislation is in place, no matter where a trial is held in Australia, Commonwealth offences will be proved in the same way and this will reflect a common national approach for all offences as the states modify their criminal laws. This will have enormous benefits for all Australian citizens because it will simplify joint Commonwealth-state investigations and trials and increase the mobility of the legal profession and investigators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's hope that this bill will not only be the beginning of a new era for Commonwealth criminal law but for the criminal law of Australia generally&mdash;the beginning of one of the most ambitious legal simplification programs ever attempted in this country. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CRIMES AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Crimes Amendment Bill 1994 is to amend the Crimes Act 1914 as an interim measure pending the commencement of the Criminal Code Bill 1994, which will not be completed for five years. While the code bill is likely to commence in relation to its own offence provisions towards the end of this year, there are many Commonwealth offences which will need to be reviewed and consequentially amended to make them referable to the code before it applies to them. The period of five years was chosen to ensure that the transition is ordered and that it occurs without disruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While interim in nature, this bill contains much needed and long overdue reforms. The application of common law principles of criminal responsibility means that all people accused of federal offences will be subject to the same principles of criminal liability wherever they are in Australia. The bill will replace section 4, which only applied these principles to offences against the Crimes Act 1914. The common law principles of criminal liability have been extended to other Commonwealth offences to avoid a situation where there would be three sets of principles in existence during the transitional period&mdash;the code principles, the Crimes Act use of the common law, and the application of state and territory law in relation to other offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the common law principles have already applied to federal Crimes Act offences since it was first enacted in 1914. At that time there were far fewer offences in other Commonwealth legislation. Therefore the change is consistent with the effect of the policy as it was then, that is, in relation to criminal liability, people were dealt with under the same principles in different parts of the country. Finally, the code itself is largely based on common law principles and therefore this interim measure will generally be consistent with its principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minimum age of criminal responsibility has for some time varied between jurisdictions. The minimum age for criminal responsibility is seven years in Tasmania, eight years in the ACT and 10 years in the other jurisdictions. This meant that a child from New South Wales on holidays in Tasmania could be accused and convicted of a federal offence committed during the holiday, when at home he or she could not be charged for doing the same thing. That is clearly anomalous and requires reform. The approach taken mirrors proposed section 7.1 of the Criminal Code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in pressing need of reform are the laws relating to attempt and conspiracy. In relation to `attempt', the government was keen to see some clarification of this, in some respects complex, area of the law in the shorter term. In particular we wanted to act on the recommendation of the Gibbs Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law in relation to impossibility. The amendment ensures that couriers who believe that they are importing a prohibited drug are unable to avoid being charged for attempt when it is discovered the substance is something else. Apart from the question of what fault element applies&mdash;which is not dealt with in this bill but is left to the common law&mdash;the provision on attempt is the same as proposed in section 11.1 of the Criminal Code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill introduces new laws in relation to the offence of conspiracy. Measures have been included to avoid it being overused. This includes a limitation that the offence only applies where the offence to which it relates has a penalty of more than 12 months imprisonment or a fine of $20,000 or more. It also requires an overt act on the part of one of the parties to the agreement which forms the conspiracy and that proceedings only be commenced with the consent of Director of Public Prosecutions. This addresses judicial and other criticisms of the use of conspiracy charges in recent decades. This reform mirrors proposed section 11.5 of the Criminal Code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures ensure that during the period leading up to the commencement of the code the reform process is not frozen. They will facilitate the introduction of the code by following a consistent approach and helping to simplify the transition. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Criminal Code Bill and the cognate bill, the Crimes Amendment Bill, are part of a development of law reform to codify the criminal law in the Commonwealth of Australia. As the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) made very clear in his speech, we are in a situation where, with separate states, we have seen the development of criminal law on separate bases: in some places, modelled on the common law regimes; in others, codified&mdash;adopting more of the European model. So quite different approaches have been taken which, in a large country like Australia, certainly have to be viewed&mdash;as we become closer together and as we seek to operate as a nation&mdash;as matters that deserve further examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the bill, in our view, is worth while as its broader objective is the development of a model Criminal Code to be adopted in all of the Australian jurisdictions. This is one of those areas in which there is welcome support&mdash;so far as the government is concerned, I am sure&mdash;from the opposition. In other words, there is the development of a bipartisan approach to this significant area of law reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles contained in this bill have been the subject of very considerable debate. It has been the subject of very extensive examination, and that is particularly important because, when you have a lengthy examination of this sort and you develop general agreement, you have a reasonable prospect of success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Criminal Code Bill is drawn from a draft model criminal code, which has been subjected to jurisdictional agreement. It has been examined by this parliament. Specific concerns in relation to this bill and to the Crimes Amendment Bill have been examined, as the Minister for Justice has said, by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The members of that committee unanimously recommended that both bills be passed. I note&mdash;and I think this was referred to earlier&mdash;that the committee in its conclusion said that the preparation of the code and the Crimes Amendment Bill had been exhaustive and that none of the evidence before the committee questioned the need for a model criminal code and, with one exception, none of the evidence questioned the approach taken in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some criticism of the general drafting style, but that often happens in relation to Commonwealth legislation, where the states see our drafting techniques as being quite different. Some have moved to simplify theirs in particular ways, so I could understand that. However, the fact is that all of the evidence suggests that the bill is usable and workable in all the jurisdictions in Australia. That is particularly useful information to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background, the Criminal Code Bill does concern the Commonwealth criminal law. The Commonwealth criminal law encompasses the offences created by federal legislation and regulations, and the principles of criminal responsibility applicable to those offences. To understand the current difficulties with the federal system, it is necessary to understand the state and territory approaches. The Minister for Justice has dealt with some of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the state and territory level there are two main approaches to criminal law: the common law approach and the code approach, which I mentioned earlier. In New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory the criminal law is based on the common law approach. In those jurisdictions, while a significant proportion of offences are contained in acts and regulations, many are based upon the non-legislative common law principles inherited primarily from other Commonwealth common law jurisdictions. On the other hand, the criminal law in Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and the Northern Territory is based upon comprehensive codes. In those jurisdictions, there is no recourse to common law principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early years following Federation, most Commonwealth criminal law was contained in the Crimes Act 1914. That has now changed and criminal offences are contained throughout every conceivable area of Commonwealth legislation. So when a person is charged with a Commonwealth offence in a state or federal court, principles of criminal responsibility need to be applied in determining a person's guilt or innocence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the principles applicable to the Commonwealth offences are disparate and unsatisfactory. If the offence is contained in the Crimes Act 1914, common law principles apply. For the remainder, and the majority of Commonwealth offences, the Judiciary Act 1903 provides that the relevant state or territory laws apply. That means that two people convicted of the same Commonwealth offence in different states may be subject to different rules. These rules can have a substantive impact on the outcome of the prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gibbs review of the Commonwealth criminal law recommended that the general principles of criminal responsibility for Commonwealth law should apply. In the second reading speech, the Minister for Justice mentioned something of the Gibbs review. I want to make my own comments in relation to the eminence of the people who examined these questions for the Commonwealth. The committee was chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs, a former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia&mdash;a very distinguished Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee included the Hon. Justice Ray Watson, a senior judge of the Family Court of Australia and one who played a very significant part&mdash;and I was often reminded by the judge of this matter&mdash;in the drafting of the Family Law Act. I am not sure whether Mr Justice Murphy or Mr Justice Watson could take the greater credit for family law. However, Mr Justice Watson has been a very distinguished judge who has been known to my family for many years. He suffered considerable tragedy in his life in later years, but certainly it is a great credit to him that he has been involved in this work in a very constructive way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Mr Andrew Menzies AM, OBE, one of the very distinguished officers of our Attorney-General's Department, who retired some years ago, has contributed to government in an advisory capacity in a number of areas. He is a widely respected person whose skills have been drawn upon in this area. It is the eminence of people such as this reporting on these matters that has enabled such a positive outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill represents the first phase in the implementation of the recommendations of the Gibbs review and, as the minister said, it is expected that that implementation will take five years. It has been set as one of the major achievements of our centenary of Federation. I think that will give plenty of opportunity for a cooperative approach of bringing everybody on board in relation to the implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is determined that in order to achieve consistency while the reform process continues there should be an interim position whereby common law principles are applicable to all Commonwealth offences, and that requires an amendment to the Crimes Act 1914, which is included in the bill that we are discussing today, the contemporaneous amendments to the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, the reform agenda is wider than an attempt to codify Commonwealth criminal law. The aim is to achieve uniformity across all jurisdictions of criminal law principles, and the goal has been endorsed for the year 2001 by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The government has indicated that the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee, made up of criminal law experts from each jurisdiction, has developed agreed principles for the model Criminal Code and the draft is anticipated by 1998. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with the provisions, the bill sets out the principles of criminal responsibility which will apply within five years to all Commonwealth offences. The principles are contained in chapter 2. The five-year delay is due in part to making consequential amendments to offences contained across a range of Commonwealth legislation. That is because the offences are drafted on the basis of principles that might apply. The delay is also a result of a plan to incorporate in the code, with appropriate redrafts, the offences contained in the Crimes Act 1914. It is planned that those offences will be moved into the Criminal Code in 1995, that is, this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time the act will be proclaimed and will apply in relation to offences within the code. The code will apply to other Commonwealth offences not later than five years after the date on which the act receives royal assent. The bill is being introduced now so as to provide a firm legislative base on which to begin the process of drafting consequential amendments. It is also being introduced to indicate to the states and territories the Commonwealth's commitment to the development of the model Criminal Code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 1 of the code deals with the codification process itself. At present all the chapter provides is that the only offences under Commonwealth law are those created by the code or under any other Commonwealth act. In other words, when the code comes into force there will be no common law, Commonwealth criminal law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles contained in chapter 2 are a combination of the elements of common law jurisdictions and the code jurisdictions, as noted in the second reading speech. On the one hand, the code contains subjective fault based principles of criminal responsibility which reflect the approach of common law jurisdictions while, on the other hand, it has provisions such as those relating to intoxication, which are closer to the approach of the code jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 2 of the code is divided into parts 2.1 to 2.2 inclusively. Part 2.1 of the code outlines the purpose and application of the chapter, which is to codify the general principles of criminal responsibility. Part 2.2 deals with the elements of an offence. It provides that defence consists of physical elements and fault elements which provide the traditional analytical basis of offences known as the actus reus and mens rea respectively. The characteristics of the physical elements and fault principles are described in detail in the remainder of part 2.2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The code follows the common law approach in specifying subjective fault elements. The second reading speech states that this was the preferred approach in the vast majority of submissions received and is consistent with the United States model penal code, the English draft code and the Canadian draft code, as well as the Gibbs committee recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2.3 contains circumstances in which there is no criminal responsibility. This part deals with criminal responsibility of minors, mental impairment, intoxication, mistake of fact, mistake of law, claim of right, intervening conduct, duress, emergency and self-defence. The mental impairment provisions follow what is known as the McNaghten test. That test and the relevant provision provide that a person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the person was suffering from a mental impairment so that the person did not know the nature and quality of the conduct or did not know that the conduct was wrong or was unable to control the conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Particularly noteworthy are the provisions relating to intoxication. Under the provisions, voluntary intoxication cannot be taken into account in determining whether conduct was voluntary or whether fault elements of an offence element of basic intent existed. This follows the approach of the code states. It differs from common law jurisdictions where gross intoxication can be taken into account in determining whether a person had intent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has stated that the approach taken in this bill has been endorsed by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Part 2.4 deals with extensions of criminal responsibility. It contains provisions dealing with attempt, complicity and common purpose, innocent agency, incitement and conspiracy. The bill makes amendments to the current conspiracy laws to take into account judicial and other criticisms of abuse of conspiracy laws. The provision imposes limits on the situations when conspiracy applies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2.5 deals with corporate criminal responsibility. The bill introduces the concept that criminal responsibility should attach to bodies corporate where the corporate culture encourages situations which lead to the commission of offences. In addition, negligence may be proven by failure to provide adequate communication within the body corporate. It is stated that the provisions make companies accountable for their general managerial responsibilities and policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2.6 codifies established principles dealing with proof of criminal responsibility and the respective burdens of proof that must be discharged. The government has determined that certain areas of reform cannot wait five years for implementation. They are the provisions relating to the age of criminal responsibility, the law of attempt and the law relating to conspiracy. Provisions mirroring those in this bill have been included in the Crimes Amendment Bill, which is being debated cognately and which is intended to enter into force in the short term. When this bill enters into force, the Crimes Amendment Bill 1994, which we are going to pass today, will be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that not everyone agrees with all aspects of the bill, although support for the general approach taken and the concept of the model national Criminal Code has been almost unanimous. When the Senate committee considered the details of the bill, there were concerns expressed in a number of areas, including intoxication as a defence, conspiracy, duress and corporate criminal responsibility; in other words, in relation to specific matters of detail in relation to what is to be the model code. It is clear that where concerns were raised there were legitimate competing views, making the ultimate choice a finely balanced decision. In its report, the Senate committee noted the bill provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a thorough, workable, logical and balanced compromise between competing legal policy views, and perhaps more importantly, between the competing interests of the State and of the people, which lies at the heart of criminal law.</PARA>
<PARA>The Crimes Amendment Bill implements the reforms to Commonwealth criminal law as an interim measure, pending the commencement of the Criminal Code Bill, which I have just discussed. The substantive provisions mirror certain aspects of the Criminal Code Bill but, as with that bill, the Crimes Amendment Bill is not opposed by the coalition. In the debate on that bill, the Criminal Code Bill of 1994 is noted as the first phase of the government's attempt to codify Commonwealth criminal law. The code is being implemented in stages and because of the need to make consequential amendments the bill will not enter into force until five years hence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the government has determined that it is desirable that some areas of reform contained in the Criminal Code Bill be implemented in the short term. These reforms are contained in this bill. They deal with, firstly, the age of criminal responsibility: the provisions standardise the current situation such that persons under 10 years of age are not liable for offences under Commonwealth law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the issue of the law of attempt, the provisions require that the conduct said to constitute the attempt must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence. The provisions allow for a conviction even where committing the offence attempted is impossible. Finally, in relation to law relating to conspiracy, the provisions aim to reduce the abuse of conspiracy charges. The provisions only apply where the offence to which they relate has a penalty of more than 12 months imprisonment, or a fine of more than $A20,000. Proceedings may be commenced only with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the provisions mirror those in the model Criminal Code Bill.

For the remainder&mdash;and the majority&mdash;of Commonwealth offences, the Judiciary Act 1903 provides that the particular state law and territory laws apply. The amendment is designed to produce a measure of consistency while the reform process is under way.

People are coming at it genuinely from different views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end there has to be compromise, and that is what has happened here: the Commonwealth and the state Attorneys-General have adopted the Criminal Code Bill 1995 and endorsed it. It is good to see that such uniformity of view exists, because that augurs well for what this project is about. No longer is it tolerable in the criminal code, or, indeed, in other areas of civil law and commercial law, that, by chance, depending on what state or territory you reside in, you are treated differently from other citizens within the Commonwealth. The pleasing aspect of this particular bill is that we will have equality before the law and that will uniformly help to ensure that all people, no matter where they reside in Australia, will be tried in accordance with the same basic principles, and, through that, that all people will enjoy equality before the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unconscionable not to take steps to address this, because it is quite wrong that Queenslanders are treated differently from people from New South Wales or Tasmania. That is the most pleasing aspect of this legislation, and the Minister for Justice, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the relevant state ministers ought to be congratulated for their attempt to reach agreement and for their ability to compromise in their attempt to reach uniformity, because the overriding principle is uniformity. We can argue some of the principles and they will be ongoing arguments, because I am sure that we, as a parliament, will from time to time be urged to review certain aspects of the code. That situation will result from judicial decisions and experience, and that is what parliaments at the national level and state level do all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing that I do not want to see&mdash;and I am not saying that this will be the case in relation to this bill&mdash;is that, in the effort to reach uniformity and compromise, we play to the lowest common denominator. It needs to be said at the outset that that has not happened in this bill, and I have not heard any of that criticism. In relation to intoxication, there has been vigorous debate as to whether the Majewski approach or the O'Connor approach should be preferred. The criminal law officers preferred the O'Connor approach, and that is my preferred view. In the end, that has not prevailed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to conspiracy, the threshold of 12 months is applied. I understand the reasons for that, whereas the officers committee recommended two years. However, there is a provision there, in terms of the precautions, to stop an abuse in terms of overcharging with a charge of conspiracy. That needs to be acknowledged and accepted, and I congratulate the minister in relation to that area. He has taken on board some of the concerns expressed during the consultation process but he has not moved away from what is an important principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My reservations relate only to a caution to the parliament because this is the first stage of an ongoing process. I come to the parliament with a decade of experience in the criminal law field. From 1979 until 1990 I practised exclusively in New South Wales in the criminal law field, firstly as a public solicitor and then as a public defender defending people charged with serious criminal offences. Parliamentarians need to be very careful about the attitude in the community at the moment, where there are genuine concerns in the community about the level of penalties, the level of incarceration and the applicability of certain offences. There is a generally held view in the community that we are being too lenient in relation to penalties for offences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traditionally criminal law has been, in effect, the states' domain. The Commonwealth, as the minister quite rightly pointed out in his second reading speech, had very limited involvement in the Criminal Code. So a lot of the practitioners and a lot of the experience reside in the states. I think it is fair to concede that at the outset. That is why it is pleasing to see this cooperative approach that the Commonwealth has adopted. We have not turned around and said, `We are the experts in the field and so we are going to bring in a model criminal code. We are just going to adopt Commonwealth principles, or whatever.' Without criticising the Attorney-General's Department&mdash;I hold the department and officers of that department in very high esteem&mdash;I believe that, just as a matter of reality, at Commonwealth level the officers in that department do not have the depth or level of experience as those in the state jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think most of the crime that we normally know of has traditionally been at a state level, but it is expanding at a Commonwealth level. That is why we need to address it now in a cooperative fashion, in view of drug importations and other matters that are crossing state borders, crossing territory borders, crossing international borders. Basically, that sort of recent trend has meant that more and more as a Commonwealth we have to legislate in this area. In the past the states could effectively legislate but that is not the case any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give that word of caution because I have grave reservations about a number of pieces of legislation that in recent years have been introduced in New South Wales and Victoria. I am talking about the Kable bill in New South Wales and the Gary David bill in Victoria. I have grave reservations because, whilst I think those parliaments enacted those pieces of legislation in all good faith&mdash;and obviously they are the law of the land in those states&mdash;personally as a practitioner I feel that the parliament was responding too heavily in response to community concerns. I am not saying that there were not problems in relation to Kable and Gary David. Of course there were, and serious problems that the parliamentarians and legislators needed to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just felt that what happened there was that it was driven too far. At times we in the parliament need to stand up and say, `We understand that that is the popular view, but we cannot adopt that.' We need to justify our role. I am concerned that bad cases make bad law. The thing with this model code and the way we are going is that that is less likely because we are looking at uniformity. The governments and parliaments of various states or territories will be able to say, `This is in the national interest. Yes, we hear what you are saying.' Then I would anticipate that it would come to the committee at a national level, where I think a more rational debate can take place rather than a localised debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great tragedy in New South Wales, with the Kable bill, was that as a result of a pending election both political parties felt the need to support what I say quite honestly and openly is a bad precedent. They legislated to incarcerate someone on what he might do. To me, that is anathema in dealing with the criminal law. I am not attempting to justify what Kable did, in terms of the facts of that particular case, but I am an old practitioner. I am fairly conservative in relation to incarcerating someone and denying him his liberty. I am not talking about attempt cases or whatever. In terms of letters being written and threats being made, I believe that there are adequate sanctions in the existing law if someone transgresses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what is pleasing about this because I think that by going to a uniform code we will be able to resist what are legitimate pressure groups and legitimate concerns. I had a recent study trip to America, the United Kingdom and the United States, having a look at their criminal justice systems. I fear for some of the developments that are taking place in those countries because I think that we have one of the best criminal justice systems in the world, and that that is because we have drawn together the best of the lot of the strands of those particular jurisdictions that I have just talked about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, with the increasing attention of the media and the need for sensationalism and the need for headlines and ratings, the criminal area is an area that the media have started to pick up more and more. That has resulted in a lot of pressure on politicians. I am not saying that in relation to this legislation because we need the consultation process that has occurred here. It is pleasing to see that there was again a senate committee looking at this. Just because the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) or the Minister for Justice, who is at the table, or the various ministers get together&mdash;no disrespect to them&mdash;and put their tick on a particular piece of legislation or because the bureaucrats do so, I do not happen to believe that it is sufficient consultation. Part of the consultation process involves the parliament and its committees because it is one way that as members of the parliament we can bring before us some experts to understand what is currently happening in the field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, I practised for 10 years exclusively in the criminal law area as an advocate. It has been almost five years since I was elected to the parliament&mdash;five years next month. I am amazed at the extent to which it is like when athletes stop training and are obviously not as fit or as capable. That is why the parliamentary process is very important for us in studying these items of legislation because we then have an opportunity to bring before us current practitioners in the field. It is an education process in terms of the parliament and parliamentarians as well, and I think that augurs well for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent changes in the House of Representatives have seen the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee play a critical role in evaluating some legislation that has come before the parliament. In the end, that process has enhanced and enriched the particular legislation. I note that the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), a member of that committee, is present to debate the legislation. I know that the minister, who is at the table, acknowledges the role of that committee and its bipartisan approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking here about cheap political points. What we are doing here through this bill is setting the standard, the code, by which all our fellow citizens are going to be judged. My view is that the criminal area and legislation such as this should not be the subject of cheap political shots. I am not talking about vigorous debate in relation to policy. It is well known that the minister and I have different views, but we respect one another's views. Where compromises can be made, they have been made. Where concessions have been made, they have been made. But sometimes a decision has to be made about a particular policy path to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing that the bill before the parliament today enjoys cross-party support&mdash;not unanimous support as far as individuals are concerned, but I would have thought it had near unanimous support across the parliament and unanimous support from the ministers involved. It is not useful to indicate where one group recommended something and another group varied from that position. Where that happens it is not a weakening of the bill; that shows that the consultation process is working, that we are having filters at different levels and that people are not just accepting the first look at the bill as the only way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the ministers have differed from the code shows that serious consideration has been given to what is a draft. That is a development that I would like to see more and more occurring so that as members of parliament we are not already locked into a situation if practitioners bring forward further material involving problems of implementation that were not apparent to an earlier committee. If these problems come out in evidence, we should be able to adopt the changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud this development. It is going to be a tortuous path, not an easy path. Certainly, it is very satisfying when a stage of the process is completed. This bill has been a long time coming. Five years is a fair time in terms of a staged process because it allows for consultation. Too often things are rushed because of deadlines, allowing insufficient scrutiny. That is where there is a balance. Too often we are told a bill has to be passed by such and such a date and that there are imperatives. I have always felt that it was a conspiracy by the executive, but that is not the case with this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has been subjected to tortuous consultation and that is why we are getting a reasonably good bill. I am quite happy to support both these bills. The Crimes Amendment Bill contains interim measures in relation to a number of matters to do with age and makes 10 years of age the uniform age for criminal responsibility throughout Australia. That is a desirable progression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other than that, there is not much to say. The minister's second reading speeches in relation to each of the bills have put the issues before the parliament fairly and squarely, quite rightly pointing out that there were differences of opinion in relation to some aspects of the bills. I applaud him for that. The criminal area is something that not a lot of members of parliament have had experience in as legal practitioners and a lot of colleagues would not understand. The same principles apply in other areas of the parliament. We should seek to get uniformity on such matters. I commend the bills to the House. </PARA>

As the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has said, the Criminal Code Bill is the first step in the process of codifying Commonwealth criminal law. It sets out what could be described as the foundations of the proposed new code, the general principles of criminal responsibility. In anticipation of the proposed code the Crimes Amendment Bill applies Commonwealth principles of criminal liability to all Commonwealth offences as a transitional position. It also introduces immediate reforms to the age of criminal responsibility in the law of attempt and conspiracy until the code comes into force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) has mentioned the Gibbs committee which was established in 1987. I note that Sir Harry Gibbs, after whom the committee is named, only retired as Chief Justice of the High Court in February 1987. He went straight from the high court into reforming the law. The committee's task was to review aspects of criminal law. It was to do that when most of the states and territories were similarly reviewing their criminal laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state, Western Australia, the Criminal Code had been undergoing an extensive review over a number of years by Mr Justice Murray, who was at that time Mr Michael Murray QC. At one stage, he had been the Chief Crown Prosecutor in Western Australia. He produced a voluminous report which has been implemented in stages and which I think is still being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1990, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General agreed to put the development of the uniform criminal code on its agenda and established a criminal law officers committee, which is now known as the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee. This committee was made up of senior officers from each jurisdiction with responsibility for advising his or her Attorney-General on criminal law matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note from an article by Mr Graham Scott QC&mdash;also a former Chief Crown Prosecutor in Western Australia, now Mr Justice Scott of the Supreme Court&mdash;that the impetus for the standing committee to put the item on its agenda came from a meeting in Brisbane in April 1990 of a body called the Society for the Reform of the Criminal Law. That body apparently held a seminar to discuss the desirability of producing a uniform criminal code for Australia and, according to Mr Justice Scott, the project was adopted enthusiastically by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, who formed and funded the criminal law officers committee. I mention that only because that body is not known to me and I do not know that it continues; its purpose may have been superseded by the actions of the standing committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The model code committee took the view that issues of criminal responsibility were fundamental to any criminal code and issued a discussion draft chapter of a model code. Where some elements of an offence occur in one state and other elements in the neighbouring state, it should, of course, make no difference to criminal responsibility which elements occur where and the Criminal Code Bill generally follows the proposals of the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee delivered a discussion draft of a chapter of a model criminal code dealing with general principles of criminal responsibility to SCAG in July 1992, and it was circulated for comment. Some 52 written submissions were received in response to that discussion draft. In addition to the written submissions, the final report reflected the substance of many meetings held with criminal law experts and detailed comments from delegates to the Fourth International Criminal Law Congress held in Auckland in September 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee designed the provisions relating to general principles of criminal responsibility so as not to affect existing legislation until three years after the enactment of the general principles chapter. This has now been extended to five years. Given the length of time Mr Justice Murray took to review the Western Australian criminal code and the length of time it has taken to implement those recommendations, I think the extension of time to five years is entirely appropriate, even if that time may have had something to do with the timing of the centenary of federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the delay is to allow time to review existing legislation in those jurisdictions which may wish to enact the general principles as set out in the Criminal Code Bill without awaiting completion of the whole code. Some jurisdictions, on the other hand, may prefer to wait and see the entire code produced before contemplating adopting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Commonwealth criminal code cannot, of course, cover all areas of criminal law. The Commonwealth only has legislative competence in the areas provided to it by the constitution. The states and, under present arrangements, the territories have the power to legislate for the residue, which is the bulk of the criminal law. It includes such matters as assault, sexual assault, murder and theft and other property offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Crimes Act 1914 of the Commonwealth creates certain specific Commonwealth offences, chiefly relating to Commonwealth officers and property. Most Commonwealth offences, which include matters relating to the environment, health, heritage, insurance and banking, are created under other specialised Commonwealth legislation. Clearly then, there cannot be a uniform or model Criminal Code applying Australia-wide, but Commonwealth criminal law can be codified and state criminal law can be codified. So, too, the overarching principles, such as those relating to criminal responsibility and sentencing, can be unified for the sake of consistency and they can be made easier to understand, easier to find and, one hopes, more easily obeyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the Criminal Code Bill is not just to reform Commonwealth criminal law, but to serve as the basis of a model Criminal Code for all jurisdictions and generally to improve or tidy up the criminal law in Australia. It is intended that the Commonwealth code will be developed in stages. The code bill applies the general principles of criminal responsibility immediately to all offences against the code and to all other Commonwealth offences five years after the day on which the code receives royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea is that a draft code is developed in stages by cooperation between the states, territories and the Commonwealth. It is then to be implemented by the Commonwealth, in the first instance. Those of the states and territories that choose to do so will adopt and implement appropriate parts of the model code. Thus, for example, the Western Australian version of the code could be legislated for by the Western Australian parliament, but if, and when, and to the extent that the Western Australian government is satisfied that to do so is in the best interests of the people of that state. It is anticipated that other states will go through a similar process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the code is being developed with the cooperation of, and in consultation with, most of the states, it is more likely than not that the resulting code will be acceptable to the states and therefore will be adopted by the states and territories involved in the process. I say `most of the states' because it is my understanding that Victoria is not represented on the model code committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation that is enacted by each state and territory in the Commonwealth would therefore share a central core, but by no means be identical. Because the law will be able to be amended by the parliaments of the states and the Commonwealth, it will inevitably develop differently in accordance with the different requirements of the states. It is to be hoped, however, that the developments will not go off in different directions without being prompted by some particular state interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme, when implemented, will be a huge advantage to the administration of justice. It will be a particular boon to lawyers who practise in the criminal law field. At the moment, lawyers are obliged, when reading any case, to identify clearly at the outset whether the case relates to a common law offence or to a statutory offence in a common law jurisdiction, or is a code offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The code states&mdash;Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania&mdash;have all basically adopted the code developed at the turn of the century by Sir Samuel Griffith, the first Chief Justice of the High Court, and it has served extremely well. Something has been made, in the speeches on these bills up to this point, of the distinctions between code offences and common law offences. For my part, I think there is some exaggeration of that. Certainly, there are elements of code offences which are less subjective than common law offences, but there is, notwithstanding the different approaches, a huge area of similarity. The High Court has inevitably been faced with the difficulty in dealing both with common law offences and code offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, certainly in the last 20 years, the court has always had among its members lawyers from both code and common law jurisdictions. The High Court has in its criminal law decisions made some attempt to unify the law by interpreting code provisions in accordance with common law principles and, equally, determining common law principles by reference to the code, but there are significant differences that prevent uniformity from being achieved through judicial revision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that a model criminal law system should be achieved through a code rather than by use of the common law. It is appropriate because, if a citizen is to lose liberty or property or privileges under the sentence of the court for a criminal offence, the rules should be written and capable of being read by everyone so that they can be capable of being obeyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether the drafting of the bill is a success is to be seen. I noted that in the evidence given before the Senate committee on legal and constitutional affairs there was some criticism of the bill. For my part, I welcome the use of expressions such as `physical element' and `fault element', in lieu of `actus reus' and `mens rea', which, while readily known to anybody who has studied criminal law, are not known to citizens and can only serve, I think, to confuse juries when the terms are used in addresses to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The content of the bill has proven to be remarkably uncontentious. I suspect that if the recommendation to follow the Majewski line in relation to intoxication&mdash;rather than the common law, O'Connor line&mdash;had not occurrred, the debate would have gone on from another direction. It is obviously a difficult area, and there are quite a number of difficult areas where there is a bald choice between two alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence before the Senate committee suggests that there really have been no major criticisms of the work of the committee, which is most commendable. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) commented upon the value of committee review of bills and I strongly share his sentiments. In this case, while nothing came out of the Senate committee in the form of recommendation for amendment, it is, I think, comforting to those who do not have time, as most members of parliament do not, to study legislation in detail that the committee has reviewed the bills, has recommended that both be passed and has made only one other recommendation. That is, the committee recommends that the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General ensure that the officials and drafters working on the model Criminal Code are directed to maintain a commitment to drafting in simple and concise language in future chapters of the code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular feature of the work of that Senate committee upon which I am pleased to comment is that the committee actually held a hearing in Perth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look back to a young constable still training as a police officer who undertook a study of what was then the common law of theft&mdash;a very strange definition, if indeed the common law does have definitions. Certainly the law of theft was expressed in very strange language to those not used to the study of law. One goes back further and looks at the history of how the common law came to develop laws of theft and laws against property generally. It was clear that in the 17th and 18th century&mdash;of course, the English common law developed in England&mdash;most criminal offences were an attempt by a ruling class to enclose laws against those it saw as the subservient class. In fact, most of the English common law is historically laws passed by a minority which had the power in England to control the majority which had no economic or political power in that period. Hence the genesis of the English common law is in the Dark Ages. Over the years there have been fundamental changes to that English common law as lawyers became more common and individuals took greater control over the creation and passing of laws, and perhaps judges themselves became more aware of the social factors involved in the commission and structure of crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law of theft, of course, has undergone many changes. From a lawyer's viewpoint in Australia, the tragedy is that it was not Australia which was leading the world, as we often do in change, in amending and restructuring the criminal law. Actually, it started in America. I do not think there is a law student in Australia who has not gone into a law library and delved into the American restatement. Surely it is the greatest codification of law the world has ever seen. It still stands in all law libraries as the way I think a lot of lawyers see the need for laws to change. For those who have never thought about the American restatement, it is a large volume of books which go back many years. America being a common law jurisdiction, an American group actually decided to write the then English common law practice in the United States into fairly simple language in a series of codes which people could understand. I know as a law student I very regularly delved into the American restatement to try to understand and to come to better grips with the quite often nebulous nature of English common law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, in some ways we have not led the world as we often do in reform legislation, particularly social reform legislation, in this area. In fact, even England has led us to an extent, because the law of larceny or the law of theft was amended many years ago and codified by the English Theft Act. It took some years for that even to permeate Australian jurisdiction. I am pleased to say that some years ago now Victoria codified the law of theft and it is now in the Victorian Theft Act. It has basically simplified and made the law understandable to ordinary people. If I have any criticism of law, it is that only lawyers seem to understand it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose, from a Commonwealth parliamentarian's perspective, that the difficulty lies in the separation of powers in this country: the fact that states have constitutional powers to pass laws for the good government of the states. The Commonwealth has, over the years, been hamstrung by the defined powers in our federal constitution which mean that the states are still primarily responsible for the passing of the bulk of criminal laws in this country. We know that the states, irrespective of which particular political party may run a state from time to time, are not exactly reformist.

Even back in my days at university we had lecturers telling our open, young minds how we should go out to practice and try to force change into the codification areas. An example is in how lawyers draft and prepare wills. I recall that we had a lecturer named Stan Robinson. In the drafting course that I did there, he taught us to use English as English in drafting wills and legal documents, to get away from the wherewiths and the hereinbefores and hereinafters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. That is 18th century&mdash;or, sometimes, 17th century&mdash;language, which lawyers are so willing to use because they are bred on precedent and because each is anxious not to change the law in case he or she becomes the first bunny to appear in court for doing a will which is challengeable. As a lawyer, I have found this has always been a major problem in effecting change by the use of language.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The English common law, rightly or wrongly, has always operated on the basis that a case decided by judges becomes law. If a judge has made a particular decision on a particular set of circumstances, in the criminal or civil jurisdictions, and it goes to appeal in the final jurisdiction of appeal&mdash;in the old days, the Privy Council, or, these days, the High Court of Australia&mdash;that becomes a law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lawyers, if they are careful and do not want to have high surety and indemnity costs, are very loath to change language. They are very frightened to change language, because of the personal risks associated with a particular legal precedent established by what we love to call the `common law'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The common law has never been common. This is one of the great problems. The common law has been inclusive and exclusive. It is only an area of practice which an exclusive few people are privileged to understand or allowed to get involved in. I might say that today it is not so exclusive, because I understand that there are as many legal undergraduates in universities in Australia as there are practising lawyers. Maybe it is time the law was broken up and some of the `mysteries' of the law were made more available to the general public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that as a background to the common law, because it is a mysterious area. Lawyers who practise in it are forced to look at history to determine today's law. They are forced to look at precedent. Most legal training is a study of how one goes into a law library and searches through myriad law reports, back into ancient history. Law books that we all look at are almost falling apart because they are so old. But, as law students, we still go back and pick up these crumbling books, look at the words of judges centuries dead and, with wisdom, ponder upon the words they spoke back then and say, `This is the law.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet law should be current. Law should be appropriate to the day and the circumstances in which we live, as lawyers; in which the parliament operates, as parliamentarians; and in which the people we say we represent live their lives and conduct their business. So this change is long, long overdue. I am so proud that, as a lawyer, I can stand here, as part of a Labor government, and say, yet again, `We have done it.' As we did with the National Crime Authority, as we did with the changes to the law of evidence, as we did with the Proceeds of Crime Bill, as we did with all of the enormous changes to the law in the last decade, it has been a Labor government that has done it in what is a relatively short space of time in the history of this country.

It is interesting to look around and see that it is mostly lawyers who are standing in this debate and who are all supporting it so strongly. There are some who do not understand the law&mdash;we know that. Nevertheless, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is an important bill. Whilst it is at the moment Commonwealth law, what I find so pleasing about it is that the states are now cooperating with the Commonwealth through committees, and we hope&mdash;indeed, I will almost pray&mdash;that within a very short space of time criminal codification will occur across all the states so that there is a unified criminal law operating equally within each state.</PARA></TALK.START>

I understand Victoria has now joined the process of negotiation and consultation, so, hopefully, those changes will also occur in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty that we have always faced in this country, as I said originally, is that the states have sovereign constitutional power and the Commonwealth has limited constitutional power. Hence, the only way we, at the federal level, can envisage a national parliament with a national set of laws is through the states. My plea today to the states will be: do not hesitate, do not wait, forget state pride, forget the antagonism which still exists between states, get behind the Commonwealth in this process and ensure that sooner, rather than later, we will have that codified law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several aspects of the code, as it is now before the parliament, which are very noteworthy. The first, of course, is section 1.1, which should be noted because it states that the only offences&mdash;the only offences&mdash;against the laws of the Commonwealth are those offences created by or under the authority of this code or any other act. That is a very important statement. It is a statement which says that the parliament of Australia is the only body which has authority to create criminal offences. That sounds almost as though it need not be stated. But the reality is that, under the English common law system, judges have had the power to create new offences in the criminal area.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join the honourable member for Tangney in enjoying the fact that, finally, actus reus and mens rea will be cast from legal language. They are finally to be cast to the winds and lawyers will not have to sit back and pretend that they are Latin experts when they are not, and they will not have to spend hours practising how to say actus reus or mens rea.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are probably right. They are often used in the wrong sense and there is the rest of the language which we love to use to pretend that we are knowledgeable in Latin. However, Latin is no longer a requirement for lawyers as it once it was. Another marvellous element of this criminal code is that, finally, we are talking about physical elements and mental elements, which are the two aspects where we once said actus reus and mens rea. Any reasonably intelligent person can pick up this code, read division 4 and understand what the parliament is saying about the law, and that was never possible in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as division 2.3 is concerned, we are finally saying that there should be a uniform age from which criminal responsibility will flow. The code provides that it is 10 years of age, but currently each state has a different age. It is interesting in a number of ways. Honourable members will know that the current inquiry of the Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority concerns organised criminal paedophile activity. One of the things we are discussing at the moment, and which it is necessary to work out before we undergo the inquiries, is the question of what a child is. What is, at law, a child? When is an act paedophilic? When is an act not paedophilic? Is an act paedophilic when the child is prepubescent or when the child is postpubescent? There are areas which I had never thought of until we started this particular area of inquiry, and yet there may be, within this code provision, an area where we say that, in terms of paedophilic responsibility, a child under 10 is in the area we will look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is for the committee to decide, but at least we finally may have a guide so that we can start to define, as a committee, what we are looking at when we talk about a paedophilic act. Currently the law defines sexual offences in terms of age. Even today, in one of the states, it is still a criminal offence for a male above the age of 21 years to have a sexual relationship with a woman above the age of 16 years and under the age of 18 years, even though it is not a criminal offence for a male above the age of 18 and below the age of 21 to have a sexual relationship with a female between the ages of 16 years and 18 years. </PARA>

It is the old offence of carnal knowledge, and it sits on the statute books in Victoria despite the fact that it has not been used for so long that people probably would have difficulty in finding out where it is. Again, in terms of some of these areas, we need to look at and to codify what we are talking about in terms of criminal and noncriminal sexual activity. It is all over the place between the states at the moment. The laws are old and they are often anachronistic. I recall that even when I was in the police force over 25 years ago the Victorian police did not charge under the 16 to 18 years of age carnal knowledge areas, even though they were often reported.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I always enjoy following my colleague the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland). I found what he said thought-provoking, although from the government's point of view perhaps a little self-serving in so far as he sought to give to the government full credit for the important steps which are being taken in these two pieces of legislation before the committee this morning, the Criminal Code Bill 1995 and the Crimes Amendment Bill 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to realise that there is in the community generally a desire that in a nation like Australia, as part of the many reforms that we should make to unify our laws as much as possible, the criminal law ought not to be exempted. In fact, my understanding is that the model criminal code was first a suggestion of one of the state or territory attorneys-general. We ought to be collectively congratulating ourselves as Australians on being prepared to bring forward and support two bills which I believe are major steps forward in unifying the criminal law in this nation and making it the same, as much as possible, throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been mentioned, we are debating the Criminal Code Bill 1995 and the Crimes Amendment Bill 1995, and these two bills go hand in hand. It is very appropriate that in this place we should have a cognate debate, because the Crimes Amendment Bill 1995 in effect will include some provisions which will take effect until such time as the Criminal Code Bill comes into effect in about five years time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When receiving advice on what was proposed in these two bills, as is usual the coalition consulted widely throughout the Australian community. We spoke to attorneys-general and shadow attorneys-general throughout the nation, to the Law Council, the New South Wales Criminal Lawyers Association, the Australian Federal Police and so on. I must say that there were no widespread major concerns in relation to the bills, although there were some aspects which, following a debate in the Senate, were referred to a Senate committee. That committee has recommended that the bills proceed, and thus we are not opposing what the government is seeking to do in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Criminal Code Bill 1995 concerns, as one would expect, the Commonwealth criminal law. The Commonwealth criminal law encompasses offences created by federal legislation and by regulations, and the principles of criminal responsibility applicable to those offences. To understand any of the current difficulties with our federal system it is important to look at the various state and territory approaches that we have. Various states and territories have different approaches to whether the law ought to be codified or whether there ought to be a common law approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT the criminal law has been based on the common law approach. In those jurisdictions, while a significant proportion of offences are contained in acts and regulations many are based on non-legislative common law principles. On the other hand, the criminal law in Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory is based on comprehensive codes, and in those jurisdictions there is no recourse to common law principles. It has been mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) that Sir Samuel Griffith drafted the criminal code in Queensland, and I believe that code has been followed in many other jurisdictions. It is interesting to see that the Commonwealth is following the Queensland lead in this area of codification of criminal law, although it has taken many years for this to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early years following Federation, most criminal law was contained in the Crimes Act 1914. That has now changed and criminal offences are contained throughout every conceivable area of Commonwealth legislation. No doubt there is a great maze of confusion because, to ascertain what are Commonwealth criminal offences, one has to go to the government printer and look through almost every statute. As the concept of Australia as a nation has grown, the Commonwealth has brought in many additions to the criminal law in areas such as heritage, the environment and so many other areas which were not envisaged as being suitable for criminal law in those early years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where a person could be charged with a Commonwealth offence in a particular state or federal court and, when this occurs, principles of criminal responsibility need to be applied in determining a person's guilt or innocence. Believe it or not, at the present time</PARA>
<PARA>principles relating to Commonwealth offences are disparate and unsatisfactory. If the offence is contained in the Crimes Act 1914, common law principles apply. For the remainder and majority of Commonwealth offences, the Judiciary Act 1903 provides that the relevant state or territory laws apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has created a substantial degree of confusion because it could mean that, if a person is charged in one part of the country with a certain offence, then the prosecution would proceed on the basis of the laws and principles of that particular state or territory and, if the offence occurs and the matter proceeds in another part of the country, then a different law could apply. There are major problems of equity when this happens because the different principles which apply in different parts of the country could well impact substantially on the outcome. Most reasonable people would say, if a person is charged with an offence in Australia, that it is appropriate that the rules governing the prosecution should be the same regardless of whether the trial occurs in Queensland, New South Wales or any other part of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criminal law is a very important area of the law. It is interesting that Jeremy Bentham, when speaking of how the English common law was made at the time, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as a man makes law for his dog. When your dog does anything you want to break him of, you wait till he does it, and then you beat him for it.</PARA>
<PARA>While the common law has come a long way since then and the principles are much more certain, one thing that is important, as was indicated by prior speakers, is that when you do have a codified criminal law you have a very great degree of certainty. That is very important in the Australia of 1995. It is important to know what the law is and it is important that, wherever possible, the law should be the same throughout the country as far as Commonwealth offences are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter was reviewed by Sir Harry Gibbs and his committee. The review of commonwealth criminal law recommended that there should be general principles for criminal responsibility for Commonwealth law. That report was brought down in 1990. It is interesting that this was not totally a Commonwealth initiative. State and territory governments were very keen to take up the challenge and, as I said previously, it was a state or a territory attorney-general who first suggested a model criminal code. In fact, that gentleman was the Hon. Daryl Manzie, who was then the Northern Territory Attorney-General. He suggested that the issue be placed on the agenda of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Out of that the Criminal Law Officers Committee was established and that has been renamed the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee. This committee has worked long and hard and the concept of a model criminal code, I believe, will become reality. It is very interesting to see that all states and territories are interested, wherever possible, in working together to ensure that this model Criminal Code becomes a reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Criminal Code Bill represents the first part of the implementation of the recommendations of the Gibbs review and, because there are so many things that have to be changed and so many areas right across the law, the implementation will take five years. The government has decided that, in order to achieve consistency while the reform process goes on, there should be an interim position whereby common law principles are applicable to all Commonwealth offences. That requires an amendment to the Commonwealth Crimes Act and that amendment is dealt with in the contemporaneous Commonwealth Crimes Act Amendment Bill 1994 which is being debated in a cognate way with the principal piece of legislation we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, the reform agenda is wider than the attempt to codify Commonwealth criminal law. Of course, the aim is to achieve uniformity across all jurisdictions of criminal law principles by the year 2001. Most importantly, that goal has been endorsed by SCAG, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. I think that is a major step forward and I understand that a draft model criminal code, first suggested by the Northern Territory Attorney-General, will be available by 1998. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill actually sets out principles of criminal responsibility which will apply within five years to all Commonwealth offences. The principles are contained in chapter 2 of the code. The five-year delay is necessary because there are a large number of amendments that have to be made across the range of Commonwealth legislation. That is because the offences are drafted on the basis of the principles that may apply. The delay is also a result of the plan to incorporate, with appropriate redrafts, the offences contained in the Crimes Act 1914 into the code. It is planned that those offences will be moved into the criminal code in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act will be proclaimed and will apply in relation to offences within the code. The code will apply to other Commonwealth offences not later than five years after the date on which the act receives royal assent. The bill is being introduced to put a firm legislative base on the statute book. This will indicate faith with the states and territories and will indicate in a very compelling and certain way that the Commonwealth is committed to the development of a model criminal code. I am pleased that all parties in the parliament support this very welcome development. At last we are getting the cooperation in this area that has eluded us for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 1 of the code deals with codification itself. At present, all the chapter provides is that the only offences against the Commonwealth are those created by the code or by any other Commonwealth act. In other words, when the code comes into force there will be no common law Commonwealth criminal law. The principles contained in chapter 2 are a combination of the elements of the common law jurisdictions and the code jurisdictions. As noted in the second reading speech, on the one hand the code contains subjective fault based principles of criminal responsibility which reflect the approach of the common law jurisdictions while, on the other hand, it has provisions such as those relating to intoxication, which are closer to the approach of the code jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 2 of the code is divided into parts 2.1 to 2.6 inclusive. Part 2.1 of the code outlines the purpose and application of the chapter, which is to codify the general principles of criminal responsibility. Part 2.2 deals with the elements of an offence. It provides that an offence consists of physical elements and fault elements which provide the traditional analytical bases of offences, known as actus reus and mens rea, respectively. Characteristics of the physical elements and fault elements are described in detail in the remainder of part 2.2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The code follows the common law approach in specifying subjective fault elements. The second reading speech also indicates that this was the preferred approach in the vast majority of submissions received and there is a consistency with the US model penal code, the English draft code, the Canadian draft code and, of course, the Gibbs committee recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2.3 contains circumstances in which there is no criminal responsibility. It deals with criminal responsibility of minors, mental impairment, intoxication, mistake of fact, mistake of law, claim of right, intervening conduct, duress, emergency, and self-defence. The mental impairment provisions follow what is known as the McNaghten test. That test and the relevant provisions provide that a person is not criminally responsible for an offence if a person was suffering from a mental impairment such that the person did not know the nature and quality of the conduct or did not know that the conduct was wrong or was unable to control the conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Particularly noteworthy are the comments in relation to intoxication. Under the provisions, voluntary intoxication cannot be taken into account in determining whether conduct was voluntary or whether fault elements of an offence element of basic intent existed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is actually quite interesting because there has been a lot of controversy in relation to this particular area. On balance, the government has come up with one position. Not everyone will agree with the government but I do accept that the government has come to this decision honestly. I have some concerns about it and I know that a number of other people do also. Be that as it may, the coalition is not opposing this particular proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has actually stated that the approach taken in the bill was consistent with that endorsed by SCAG. Part 2.4 deals with extensions of criminal responsibility. It contains provisions dealing with attempt, complicity and common purpose, innocent agency, incitement and conspiracy. The bill also makes amendments to the current conspiracy laws to take into account judicial and other criticisms of abuses of conspiracy laws. The provision imposes limits on the situations where conspiracy applies. A lot of the time it seems that people are charged with conspiracy when the Crown cannot dredge up any other offence. I think that what the government is suggesting here is a positive step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2.5 deals with corporate criminal responsibility. There were some concerns with what the government was suggesting here but there has been a recommendation that this matter proceed as part of the bill. Part 2.6 codifies established principles dealing with proof of criminal responsibility and the respective burdens of proof that must be discharged. The government has decided that certain areas cannot wait for the five years and that is understandable. It has decided that the age of criminal responsibility must be determined and put into effect now. The law of attempt must be clarified and also the law relating to conspiracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provisions mirroring those in the bill have been included in the Crimes Amendment Bill 1994, which is intended, as I said earlier, to take effect relatively soon. When the Criminal Code Bill enters into force, the Crimes Amendment Bill 1994 will be repealed. The government is bringing in the cognate bill, the Crimes Amendment Bill, to cover the loopholes until the principal piece of legislation becomes law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interim measure could be criticised by some saying that really it is a stopgap measure. I think it is important that, given the matters to be covered by the Crimes Amendment Bill, these matters are brought into law now. The coalition is certainly not opposing what the government is suggesting. The matters included in the Crimes Amendment Bill 1994 include the age of criminal responsibility which, as the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) said, will standardise the current situation so that persons under 10 years cannot be liable for offences against Commonwealth law. Concerning the law of attempt, the provisions require that the conduct said to constitute the attempt must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence. The provisions allow a conviction even where committing the offence attempted is impossible. With respect to the law relating to conspiracy, the provision aims to reduce abuse of conspiracy charges. The provisions only apply where the offence to which they relate has a penalty of more than 12 months imprisonment or a fine of more than $20,000. Proceedings may only be commenced with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a situation where we have two bills before the Committee today. These bills are the product of a long period of consultation, a long period of cooperation between people at this level of government and those representing the states and the territories. I commend the minister on this particular approach. I commend the government and all those who have participated in the discussions until now. The law has been complicated. There have been problems. We have, quite often, continued to operate as though we are six or seven different countries and not a nation. I do want to reject absolutely the suggestion made by the honourable member for McEwen that the states should be abolished. I believe in the federal system. I believe the states perform a very worthwhile function. It ought to be remembered that a federal system is a guarantee of decentralisation of power. When we have a decentralisation of power, it is fairly clear that we will not have a concentration of authority in too few hands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will make a couple of short remarks to conclude this debate. Before I turn to some more general comments in closing, I take this moment to put on record particular thanks for the work of David Neal, who chaired the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee for some time and then proceeded to work as a consultant in the area. David Neal has just recently had a motor vehicle accident which has caused him quite severe injuries. I am sure that all members of this committee would wish him well in his recovery and hope that the sterling work he has done, which has been so widely commended in the debate, continues. We might also recognise the work being done by those in the department that have been supporting the process. They have been entirely committed to it. We have set a fairly tight timetable in going to the year 2001&mdash;the pressure is really quite on them&mdash;and they have risen to the occasion very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a couple of remarks about what has been said in this debate. Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), from the opposition parties, who have spoken. I thank them for their commendation of these measures and the generosity of their remarks regarding the way in which this process has proceeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank my colleague the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) for the vigorous way in which he debates with me and others within government in relation to issues of principle. His is always a vital voice to be listened to in these areas and I note particularly his warning that, as we move down this process, we should avoid following models which have commended themselves in the United States and in Europe but which appear not to be appropriate for us to follow. I note also his concern that we should not allow ourselves as parliamentarians to be drawn into knee-jerk responses to immediate pressures that come from time to time, but should rather look at this as a constructive and consultative process that needs to bear in mind the whole range of issues, including those coming from those concerned with law enforcement, those concerned with civil liberties and those concerned with the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to my colleague the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), I thank him for his generous remarks. I too am pleased that Victoria now is settled into the process of reform. The comments by the Victorian Premier I welcome very much, in his commitment in joining with other premiers towards uniform criminal legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I close by saying that the thing that really impresses me about the development of the Criminal Code Bill is the way in which all those involved, whether they be state or territory officials or the parties in this parliament, have worked well towards achieving agreement on principled and workable sets of laws suitable for adoption across Australia. I think it is a fitting credit to this parliament that it be the first to enact general principles of criminal responsibility, as an expression of confidence in the aim of uniformity, and I look forward to other governments doing likewise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was scrutinised in detail by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which includes the opposition and Democrats spokespersons on the Attorney-General's portfolios. I wish to personally thank Senator Vanstone and Senator Spindler for the spirit in which they approached the bill. I know that they have made an important contribution towards the development of worthwhile, progressive and uniform criminal laws for Australia. I might note that in debate each raised some specific matters on which they have sought further advice, and I will undertake that in due course my department will respond to the specifics that they have raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe, however, that the contributions from those who have spoken in this debate have all shown vision. The same can be said for the support that has come for the criminal code from the highest levels of government. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and each Premier and Chief Minister have committed themselves to the ongoing development of the model criminal code. That is very important since the project is long-term and is aiming for completion in every jurisdiction by the year 2001. I thank all the members of the House who have participated. </PARA>

<PARA>The Archives Amendment Bill will make amendments of a minor policy nature to the Archives Act 1983. The Australian Archives plays an important role in ensuring that the history of government in Australia is preserved and is available for access by future generations of Australians. These amendments are intended to clarify the application of the Archives Act to two types of records, namely the records of government business enterprises and other commercialised bodies and the records of the national witness protection program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact. However, the amendments relating to government business enterprises will result in indirect savings through improved efficiency in the process associated with the commercialisation, incorporation and sale of government bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first category of amendments concerns the application of the Archives Act to government business enterprises. In the last few years, the Commonwealth has been reviewing the structure and operations of government business enterprises. As a result, a number of these bodies have been commercialised, incorporated or privatised in order to improve the efficiency of their operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the method used to incorporate or privatise these bodies in the last few years has resulted in problems for the Australian Archives. The first is that legislation used to privatise or corporatise the government enterprise has, on several occasions, had the effect that the body was no longer subject to the Archives Act. The second problem is that a particular legislative process used to incorporate bodies also had the effect of removing all the pre-incorporation records of the body from the operation of the Archives Act. As a result of this process, the Australian Archives has lost control of the pre-incorporation records of bodies such as the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the International Wool Commission and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments concerning government business enterprises are intended to prevent the inadvertent removal of records from the operation of the Archives Act as a consequence of a change in structure of certain bodies. To this end, the bill provides for:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.bodies that either are established for a public purpose or subject to Commonwealth control to remain subject to the Archives Act unless specifically excluded from the operation of the act; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.the prior records of bodies which are subsequently removed from the application of the Archives Act to also remain subject to the act unless specifically excluded from its application. These amendments will preserve established statutory rights of access to records of national significance or public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>It should be recognised that the bill will not prevent the transfer of Commonwealth records where the government decides this is necessary. The amendments provide for the government to preclude the application of the Archives Act to commercial government bodies, either by means of the legislation relating to the incorporation or sale of the body or by an amendment to the regulations to the Archives Act. The bill will not apply to bodies that were excluded from the application of the Archives Act prior to the commencement of these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second category of amendments concerns the application of the Archives Act to the records of the national witness protection program. Earlier this year the government enacted the National Witness Protection Act 1994. This act provides a legislative basis for a program run by the Australian Federal Police which is designed to facilitate the provision of high-level witness protection, including the issuing of alternative identity documents for protected witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes special provision for access to and custody of records of the national witness protection program. The bill:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.permits the Australian Federal Police to retain custody of certain sensitive documents relating to the national witness protection program, rather than requiring those records to be transferred to the Australian Archives;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.ensures that certain highly sensitive documents relating to the national witness protection program are exempted from public disclosure under the Archives Act; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.makes specific provision for the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, or a staff member associated with the national witness protection program, to provide documents and/or evidence to a private hearing of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Archives is responsible for the management of Commonwealth records, including the transfer of ownership or custody of such records.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments which the government is proposing will ensure that all records in relation to bodies such as these and government business enterprises will be subject to the Archives Act 1983. This means that the Archives will have control over the pre-incorporation records of bodies which are subsequently removed from the application of the Archives Act as a result of structural changes, unless the legislation associated with the change, or an amendment to the Archives Regulations, specifically exclude the body.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak firstly on the amendments relating to the records of government business enterprises. The Australian Archives has a statutory responsibility to ensure that Commonwealth records of value for historical research or which document rights and entitlements of individual citizens are preserved for future generations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present amendments to the Archives Act 1983 address a problem which has become evident in recent years with the corporatisation and privatisation of Commonwealth functions. There have been a number of instances in which valuable Commonwealth records have been transferred or sold with government business enterprises. Although this was not necessarily the intention, it occurred because of the form of the legislation authorising the sales. In consequence, there was no longer a public right of access to the records once they reached the age of 30 years and, hence, the new owners had the right to destroy them if they saw fit. The Archives has naturally been concerned for a number of years to rectify this situation to ensure that valuable records are preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases, records of privatised enterprises are of no further interest to the Commonwealth or the public, and it is appropriate for them to be transferred to the new owner. However, as has been mentioned in earlier speeches, there are other cases&mdash;for example, the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, Australian Airlines and the Australian National Line&mdash;where the records include important historical material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only existing remedies for this problem are: to seek to have provisions for retention of the records included in the legislation authorising the incorporation or sale of the enterprise; to bring the records back into the coverage of the act by regulation; and to induce the new owner to deposit the older records with the Australian Archives' corporate archives service. All three remedies are uncertain and time consuming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments provide that, if a Commonwealth enterprise is sold, the records which are created up to the time of sale will continue to be subject to the Archives Act 1983, unless there is specific provision for their removal either in the legislation authorising the sale or in a regulation under the act. The amendments are not intended to keep all such records within the act, but merely to ensure that the issue of their appropriate disposition is consciously addressed as part of the sale process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second item I wish to discuss is the amendments relating to the national witness protection program. The amendments are intended to strengthen the protection of information which might lead to the identification of protected witnesses. They are consequential to the passage of the Witness Protection Act 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to section 29 permits the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to determine, without the need to seek concurrence of the Director-General of the Australian Archives, that records may be withheld from transfer to the Archives if their release might endanger the safety of an actual or potential protected witness. All records of the security and intelligence agencies already have a similar protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to section 33 confirms that the exemption category covering confidential sources of information in relation to the enforcement or administration of the law extends to a person who has provided confidential information to the National Crime Authority or the Australian Federal Police or who has been included in the national witness protection program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments do not remove the statutory right of members of the public to seek access under the Archives Act 1983 to records relating to protected witnesses once the records reach the age of 30 years, regardless of whether the records are by then in the custody of the Archives or the Australian Federal Police. Nor do they prevent members of the public from applying to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the decision to exempt such records from public access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn from the specific amendments to say something about the Australian Archives. Although 1994 marked the 50th anniversary of the appointment of the first Commonwealth archivist, throughout most of that period the Archives has been very much an organisation in the background. An archives act was developed during the 1970s but was not passed by this parliament until 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years, the Australian Archives has sought to put greater emphasis on its public role&mdash;its role in relation to all Australians&mdash;and to make more Australians aware of what it has to offer. It is thus assuming its rightful place as not only an integral part of government administration, but one of the significant cultural institutions of our country. The Advisory Council on Australian Archives, of which I am a member, has actively encouraged the Archives to be more outgoing and to make its achievements and collections better known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of a national government archives is not always apparent, yet it is one of the essential supporting pillars of any democracy. The Australian Archives contributes to the maintenance and understanding of political, social and cultural values in Australia. It does this in three very clear ways: it promotes the role of records as evidence in supporting the role of law; it supports the effectiveness and accountability of government administration; and it preserves documentation about the interaction between the people of Australia and their governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the Australian Archives has been one of significant achievement. The Archives has devised a unique system for the intellectual quality of records. This system has become the de facto standard in Australia and it is copied and emulated widely. It has set new standards in the management of access to government records. These standards balance the public's right to know and the competing demand for protection from unreasonable disclosure of personal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In size and scale, the Australian Archives is the dominant archival institution in Australia. It is established in each state and the Northern Territory, as well as in Canberra, and its collections are truly distributed. It holds over 200,000 shelf metres of records of enduring value, documenting the archives of government and people. Almost every subject imaginable is represented in its collections, which are a little known treasure trove of information on our nation's development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something of the flavour of what I want to convey about the Archives was captured in an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> earlier this year. It described the Archives as `one of the great treasure houses of Australian history and culture'. It also noted that for most of its 50-year history the treasure has been sadly underdeveloped, under-resourced and underexploited, even by government and the bureaucracy, let alone by the public. The editorial continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Archives holds most of the constitutional documents which are the national birth certificates; just as significantly its records of public administration and policy development tell not only of the development of the nation and how Australia's politicians and public servants handled their public trusts, but also the stories of millions of Australians: our Aborigines, our immigrants, our soldiers, our industries and our agriculture, the development of communities, particularly Canberra, and the way Australia and Australians saw the world and changing times.</PARA>
<PARA>In recent years, the Archives has had some notable achievements which I believe should be mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One such achievement concerns the type of paper which is used when records are being created. Building good quality paper into records of likely long-term value saves preservation dollars. The adage about prevention being better than cure certainly applies when the size of the Australian Archives' existing preservation challenge is understood&mdash;those 200,000 metres of records of enduring value amount to over 1,100 million individual documents. Building recycled paper into files of short-term importance also makes good sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Archives has taken on the issue of paper quality and has taken notice of the increasing concern in the community about the environment and the growth of interest in recycled papers. It has used this concern to promote the development of archival quality paper manufactured through processes which use industrial cotton waste rather than virgin pulp. Through a joint venture with Australian Paper, Visyboard and Unistat, the Australian Archives has ensured the manufacture and marketing of a range of paper products and storage containers at low cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The availability of these Australian made products will allow all cultural institutions to have access to high quality materials to improve the preservation of Australia's cultural heritage. On the other side of the coin, in order to promote the use of recycled papers in appropriate cases, the Archives has developed and published guidelines for the use of papers. Those guidelines set out for the user situations where it is appropriate to use recycled papers and those where archival quality papers should be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Archives has also recognised the challenges presented by the development of electronic records, and it certainly does not underestimate these challenges. They were encapsulated in an article in the January issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Scientific American</EMPHASIS> written by Jeff Rothenberg, a computer scientist with Rand Corporation. Rothenberg began the article with the following scenario:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The year is 2045, any my grandchildren (as yet unborn) are exploring the attic of my house (as yet unbought). They find a letter dated 1995 and a CD-ROM. The letter says the disk contains a document that provides the key to obtaining my fortune (as yet unearthed). My grandchildren are understandably excited, but they have never before seen a CD&mdash;except in old movies. Even if they can find a suitable disk drive, how will they run the software necessary to interpret what is on the disk? How can they read my obsolete digital document?</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, electronic records pose problems not only for individuals but also for governments, and they are with us now, regardless of what 2045 will bring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this rapidly developing area of communication and technology, there are no hard and fast rules. The Archives has recognised, however, that guidance and advice is necessary even in this situation where the technology is constantly changing and hence the advice may have to be adjusted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a culmination of some two years work in this area, the Archives in November last year hosted a major conference bringing together archivists, record managers, librarians, other information professionals and computer industry personnel to review the state of knowledge about preservation of electronic records and to develop some consensus of approach. The conference was widely attended from Australia and overseas. In recognition of the expertise of the specialists from the Archives acknowledged at the conference, it is now represented on the electronic records committee of the International Council on Archives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned at the outset that the Australian Archives has put increasing emphasis on public programs in recent years. Over the last three years, it has mounted a range of exhibitions drawn from items in its collections which both inform and challenge our knowledge and memory of past evidence. A highlight of this exhibition program has been the exhibition `Between Two Worlds', which explores the experiences of people of part-Aboriginal descent who were taken away from their families earlier this century. The exhibition opened at Sydney in October 1993 and has been at a number of venues across the country since then. The exhibition is currently in Western Australia and is scheduled to open in Dubbo in May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other significant exhibitions that have been staged in Old Parliament House include `Making Ends Meet', which is about the development of child endowment for Australian families, and an exhibition on `Trademarks' as part of Australia's cultural identify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To mark the 50th anniversary of the death of John Curtin, the Archives is staging an exhibition on Curtin's life, which will open in this building later this year. The exhibition is being developed in conjunction with the Curtin Foundation and will eventually reside permanently at the Curtin Centre in Perth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of exhibitions is the opportunity they provide to reach a much wider number of Australians. The greater majority of us will never become researchers in the search rooms of the Australian Archives but, through exhibitions, the Archives is able to reach a much wider audience to enable people to be informed about aspects of Australia's history and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another project the Archives has commenced is the production of the first comprehensive guide to the records relating to the development of the constitution and federation in Australia. The Archives sees this as its major contribution to the centenary of federation. Its intention is that the guide be completed and published well ahead of 2001 so it will be available as a source for others writing about and preparing education kits and exhibitions on federation. This guide will build upon a series of published guides the Archives has already published in recent years, such as those describing records relating to genealogical research, to lighthouses and to Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate at this stage to look at the future environment for the Archives. The Australian Archives has identified a number of challenges it needs to address over the coming decade. These are: challenges in the changing nature of records and their use in government&mdash;and I have already referred to the issue of electronic records in this context; challenges in increasing users' appreciation of the records in the Archives' custody and access to them; challenges in arresting the deterioration of records in custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Snow)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! Will members please subdue their conversations. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Archives' strategies in response to these challenges are: to improve the value of records to government and the community but establish standards for documentation; to direct resources increasingly towards the identification, control, preservation and acceptability of records of enduring value; and to promote wider acceptability and use of the archival resources of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Archives is pursuing these strategies vigorously. I have already referred to some of the achievements. It is also conscious of the need to work cooperatively with other cultural institutions and seeks to do so wherever possible. In meeting the challenges it has identified, the Archives is changing from a low profile backroom agency, which was principally a warehouse for government records that had ceased to be of administrative use, to a modern archival institution which seeks to employ best practices in its facilities, in its handling of records and in making them available to the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred earlier to the access arrangements the Archives has developed. Under the Archives Act, there is a general presumption that government records will be available for public scrutiny after 30 years as a right. The task of ensuring that records are available to the public at 30 years has always been a challenge to the Archives. Honourable members will be aware that the 30-year-old cabinet records are made available each new year and there is a growing media interest in them. Indeed, a straightforward comparison of the 1994 and 1995 openings of 1963 and 1964 cabinet papers reveals the realisation that there is a records superhighway worth exploring. The press coverage this year, whether measured in terms of editorials, letters to the editor, number of articles or column inches, more than doubled over the last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the need to examine records for material that might need to remain exempt after 30 years, it has not always been possible for other 30-year-old material to be so readily available. Increased efforts by the Archives in this area and the development of new approaches in the light of experience are now enabling the Archives to ensure to a much greater extent that records will be readily available when sought. Obviously, the resource costs of preserving and making records available are significant. In Australia and in other Western democracies this has always been seen as a legitimate expenditure in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that through better management the Archives has been able to handle rapidly increasing numbers of public inquiries without seeking additional resources externally. By way of example, in 1989-90 visits to the search room by members of the public totalled 7,500. By 1993-94 this had almost doubled to 13,500. Over the same five-year period, the number of new researchers registering with the Archives each year increased from 2,145 in 1989-90 to 3,284 in 1993-94. Other statistics reveal a similar growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing the Archives lacks is a significant national building in order to focus its presence. The Advisory Council on Australian Archives has, since its inception, identified the lack of a national building as the outstanding requirement to enable the Archives to take its rightful place amongst the significant cultural institutions of this nation. There have been plans and proposals for a national archives building since this national capital was first developed. To date, none of them have come to fruition. Because of its unique position as a central support to government administration, as well as being a significant cultural institution holding much of the information about Australia's development, I believe that now is the time to decide that the Archives deserves a permanent location within the national capital's central areas. I know that the Archives has indicated that part of the building presently occupied by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&mdash;the administrative building&mdash;would provide a suitable national headquarters. It would seem to be too good an opportunity to miss and would avoid the need for a substantial capital outlay on a new building. Only when it is appropriately located does the council believe that the Archives will have the opportunity to perform its role to the greatest effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken at some length about the Australian Archives&mdash;but I did follow some people speaking about a legal bill&mdash;because it is an important institution and it receives too little attention in this place. Let me conclude by saying that the evidence is on the record that the Australian Archives has substantial achievements to its credit. It is focused in its approach and has a clear view and strategy for the next decade. It is aware of the challenges that confront a modern archives and is meeting these challenges. If it achieves its goals, we can confidently expect that the Australian Archives, at the turn of the century, will be a vital national organisation assisting good administration and accountability in government and making a valuable contribution to understanding our past and how our society has evolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset, along with Senator Margaret Reid I serve on the Advisory Council on Australian Archives. I think we are the longest serving members, having served on the council for approximately 10 years, and we hope that we make a significant contribution. I appeal to my parliamentary colleagues, especially ministers, parliamentary secretaries and chairpersons of caucus, in saying that the Labor Party caucus records should be in the Australian Archives, not in the National Library. I appeal to honourable members to investigate with Australian Archives the possibility of storing your office correspondence so that future generations and future researchers can study that documentation and see what a wise and able group of people occupied this building in this year. I urge you to investigate with Australian Archives the possibility  of recording and storing your material there. At least it enables you to clear out your office. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In starting my contribution to the debate on the Archives Amendment Bill, I refer to my favourite author, George Orwell, whose magnum opus is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nineteen Eighty-four</EMPHASIS>. Some honourable members&mdash;particularly those honourable members who saw the very good film which was made of the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nineteen Eighty-four</EMPHASIS> starring Richard Burton and John Hurt&mdash;may recall the role played by Winston Smith. Winston Smith, of course, played the role of the antihero of the novel and he had a function to perform in the ministry of truth. In the book, the ministry of truth deals with lies, similar to the ministry of plenty, which deals with shortages, and the ministry of peace, with deals with wars. The ministry of truth and the ministry of plenty are similar to the ministry of employment in the Labor government which predominantly deals with unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Winston Smith's role in the ministry of truth, his job was to update back copies of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS> newspaper and to alter them in such a way as to reflect more positively on the regime, the Ingsoc, the ruling English socialist party of Oceana, or Landstrip 1, as the United Kingdom was termed in the novel. There is a particular maxim that is used in the ministry of truth by Ingsoc, and that is `He who controls the present controls the past, and he who controls the past controls the future.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who saw that particularly well-made film and who can recall the images of John Hurt as Winston Smith sitting there, sending down the old versions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS> newspaper into the vast furnace that was, presumably, on the bottom floor or in the basement of this large pyramid shaped building, can understand how an ability to control the past and to be able to alter history places the present incumbents in a very powerful position indeed. In order for us to be able to interpret history, in order for us to be able to interpret the present and to look towards the future, we require records, documents and those valuable oral histories which are being compiled this year as part of the Australia Remembers commemoration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of items and government records are invaluable for citizens to be able to determine exactly how the present situation came to pass and what has occurred in the past. When one looks at recent history&mdash;in particular, in my state, the state of Western Australia&mdash;under the previous Labor governments of Brian Burke, Peter Dowding and, of course, Carmen Lawrence, one of the most serious criticisms by the royal commission that was conducted into the affairs of Western Australia Inc. was that many documents and other records of ministers and cabinet were discovered to be missing. This situation meant that it was very difficult for the royal commissioners to be able to determine precisely what had occurred. In fact, on a number of occasions&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliamentary secretary asked, `What has this got to do with the bill?' If the parliamentary secretary had listened to my opening remarks, he would see how it is relevant. Particularly in the case of the records of cabinet&mdash;which are very important records in any government system&mdash;there were occurrences where evidence of the missing records was the fact that there were yellow tabs still stuck in the files where those records ought to have been. It was as though somebody had left the yellow tabs in place in case they needed to put the missing records back in the right place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Archives Amendment Bill is a bill which makes amendments in minor policy. Nonetheless, the amendments are important because they impact on our principal source of national records, Australian Archives, which was established by the Archives Act in 1983. I listened with great interest yesterday to the statement by the Speaker of the House of Representatives in relation to access to other important databases, such as those which are held by the Parliamentary Library, and, most particularly, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> records of parliamentary debates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Speaker made quite positive and progressive comments about the accessibility of those records to the community. In fact, via the Internet, that incredible expanding communication network that Australians can have access to at a relatively cheap cost, people will soon be able to go into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> records and be able to conduct searches in the records, such as we are able to do in our own personal computers which are on-line with the Parliamentary Library. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very significant and important democratic influence because, quite clearly, in any vibrant and healthy democracy, access to information, particularly the records of decision-makers, of particular public officials, is critical. That is why any movement to make those records more accessible to the community is to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Archives is responsible for the management of records, including the storage, transfer and custody of those records. The bill arises from issues in relation to ownership of some of these records, particularly from previous government departments that have been privatised, corporatised or in some other changed in a way that may mean that those records become unavailable or less available to the Australian Archives and to the community. The bill arises from the inadvertent loss of ownership over pre-incorporation records of organisations such as the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the International Wool Commission and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I would like to point out that, while the ramifications of this bill do not impact greatly on the man or woman in the street, there is at the heart of this matter the general principle of access to information of all kinds in this country, particularly that information that is contained within the numerous government archives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised the question of Western Australia Inc. because that was, within recent memory, a good example of how records that are critical to the public interest can be lost or spirited away in such a way that the commissioners of the WA Inc. royal commission were deprived of the opportunity to verify the truth of the matter in relation to the issues that they had undertaken to examine or investigate. It made for less efficient royal commission findings: because of the lack of particular documents, the commissioners were unable to reach conclusions on a number of matters. That is one of the reasons why I, and members of the opposition, have a great deal of interest in the workings of the Australian Archives, as do the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and Senator Reid of the Australian Capital Territory, both of whom are on the board. I commend their work in ensuring that the Archives do reflect the intent to provide accessible information for Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell you, speaking from the perspective of Western Australians who live on the other side of the continent, that access to the Archives in a number of cases has become a matter of some concern. In particular, I refer to a gentleman by the name of Mr Funch of Roleystone, in the hills of the metropolitan area. He is an historian who finds his research all but impossible now that the government has indicated he must fully pay for his research projects. Formerly, he was able to have the assistance of staff at the Australian Archives to assist him with various projects. We find that, as a consequence of those charges, historians like Mr Funch and others who reside in Western Australia or, for that matter, in other more remote states find themselves at a considerable disadvantage, compared with those who may reside within travelling distance of the archive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also at the same time refer to another important Australian institution, the War Memorial, which is another source of records invaluable to historians who are endeavouring to write about Australia's past. In many cases these are people who are writing about histories that are perhaps less significant in terms of the national stage, but significant in terms of regional local interests: histories of some importance to local people or to people who reside in a particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jim Davies is another historian who resides in my electorate who has written a number of popular books about Australia's involvement in World War II. One book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Lady was not a Spy</EMPHASIS>, detailed in anecdotal form the adventures of Army and other service personnel along the Western Australian coast during the Second World War. Although it is not strictly relevant to the Australian Archives, it is following down the same issue. Both Mr Funch and Mr Davies, in their respective interests in obtaining information, have had difficulty in being able to get the information, because both the Archives and the War Memorial have stopped doing research for local authors. That has severely affected Mr Funch's ability to be able to write his local history and, in the case of Mr Davies, to write a follow-up book to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Lady was not a Spy</EMPHASIS> which deals with wartime experiences of people in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made a number of representations on behalf of both of these particular people. In the case of Mr Davies&mdash;and, of course, he also wished to avail himself of information in the Australian Archives&mdash;he must now pay a professional researcher up to $40 an hour to attend the War Memorial or the Australian Archives to be able to avail himself of that information. Obviously in the case of a state like Western Australia&mdash;and, I am sure, in the case of the home state of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan)&mdash;that is a severe financial impediment. The travelling costs and the accommodation are so prohibitive that unless historians are writing things that are going to be huge best-sellers, they could not possibly afford to travel to the national capital to undertake their own research. In my view, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is flying in the face of the stated policy of the government to make these types of records more readily available for the Australian community. </PARA>

Nonetheless, in a federation the size of Australia the interests of all Australians, not just those that live within reasonable motoring distance of here, ought to be regarded. They ought to be given the opportunity to avail themselves of this information without prohibitive costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of these two historians I have written to the various ministers to elicit a more favourable response for them. Unfortunately, the best they could say was that in the case of the War Memorial there is a research fund, and that the Australian Archives can provide access to the actual indexes of information. But these people would have to avail themselves of a researcher to pull out those particular documents and look at them and do whatever necessary research is involved. As I said earlier, that is a severe impediment to the writing of local histories in my home state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister tells me that most of the information is available at state archive departments at 30c a page. He also informs me that, in the case of the War Memorial, all books held in the research centre are listed on the Australian Bibliographic Network, available at larger state libraries. The War Memorial in particular has limited research grants available, but these are all but useless to writers of small histories such as Mr Funch and Mr Davies. They are forced to rely on the goodwill and assistance of government departments, and it seems that in the case of the federal government this goodwill is drying up. In the name of user pays, we see that in the case of outlying states&mdash;the more remote states&mdash;people are unable to get that access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to refer to the matter concerning to the arrangements in relation to the Australian Archives and the national witness protection plan. The Parliamentary Secretary (Mr Lindsay) was pointing at me a minute ago. He and I used to be on the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority together, and he would know that in the case of the national witness protection plan there are very, very significant confidentiality and secrecy requirements. Under normal circumstances I would have to agree entirely with the provisions that are in the bill to provide for exemption for Australian Federal Police documents relating to the NWPP. However, the difficulty is that that does tend to make for a less accountable situation in the case of the AFP. I would prefer to see a situation where there were provisions for a more secret arrangement within the Archives for those types of documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, nobody would like to endanger protected witnesses by having their records available to all and sundry, but I would like to see that there is proper accountability and scrutiny of the AFP and, in particular, the NWPP. As a consequence, I would prefer to see a situation where the exemption is not just at the behest of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner but is by mutual arrangement between the Director-General of Archives and the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, where the substantial concerns of public interest are taken into account and where, when necessary, extra secure arrangements can be made for those types of records within the Archives itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning, this is a non-controversial or, let us say, a minor policy change in relation to the Archives. I would like to reiterate the theme of my speech: in the interests of greater accountability, in the interests of a fairer democratic system in our nation, in the interests of those people who live in the outlying states, I urge the honourable member responsible for guiding this legislation through the committee on behalf of the government to reconsider the arrangements in the Archives for people from my state and other outlying states to be able to access historical documents, to make access more fair and equitable to all concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two matters I wish to mention in respect of the Archives Amendment Bill. The first relates to the national witness protection program, which the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) has just mentioned; the second is the contemplation by the bill of legislation by regulation. The Archives Act 1983 established the Australian Archives, which is responsible for the management of Commonwealth records, including the transfer of custody or ownership of those records.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has been prompted by the need to ensure that the Archives Act applies to the pre-incorporation records of such bodies as government business enterprises which have since establishment been commercialised, incorporated or privatised. Under the current law, there is nothing to prevent such bodies from inadvertently or deliberately removing their pre-incorporation records from the Australian Archives. This defect in the law has resulted in the pre-incorporation records of bodies such as the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the International Wool Commission and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation being lost to the Australian Archives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Federal Police is a Commonwealth statutory authority established by the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and, as such, would come within the purview of the Archives Act. But it is important, in the interests of protecting witnesses who are part of the national witness protection program and of preserving the integrity of that program generally, that certain sources and classes of information in the hands of the AFP not be publicly disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, therefore, exempts from the application of the Archives Act 1983 sensitive records concerning witnesses and participants who are connected with the witness protection program. The exemption is not to apply to such non-sensitive documents as those relating to administrative or budgetary matters, where those documents would not reveal information concerning a witness or a person assessed for inclusion in the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, this is clearly important to the integrity of the program. There is no point in establishing an elaborate and secure scheme for creating, bestowing and protecting a new identity for a witness if the records relating to that scheme are as accessible as those of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. On the other hand, I support the call by the honourable member for Moore for some form of accountability. It is difficult to see how this might be done conveniently but perhaps something in the nature of a prison governor sworn to secrecy who can make regular inspections or audits would be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter to which I refer is a matter of concern. Proposed section 3A provides that a body that was established for a public purpose is deemed for the purposes of the Archives Act never to have been so established if either a legislative provision or regulations made for the purposes of the proposed section 3A expressly provide that the body is to be taken never to have been so established. I share the concern of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee in relation to this provision. The effect of section 3A is that regulations as well as primary legislation can deem a body not to have been established for a public purpose. The ultimate effect of that is that such a body will fall outside the scope of the Archives Act. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has commented that this may be regarded as `an inappropriate delegation of legislative power'. The committee has sought the minister's advice on whether it might not be more appropriate to achieve this purpose by amending the primary legislation, the Archives Act, instead of the use in this way of the power to make regulations. To date I am not aware that the minister has made a satisfactory or, indeed, any response to the committee's concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On other occasions I have referred to my concerns about this government's use of regulations to bypass parliament. We must be vigilant to ensure that the parliament's role is not subverted by delegating the proper work of the parliament to the government to do behind closed doors. This is what happens when legislation is taken out of the hands of the parliament and appropriated by a department in the form of statutory regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parliament's role is important, not so that we as parliamentarians may have something to do with our time, but because we, the members of parliament, are the representatives of the people and, as such, are a crucial part of the democratic process. Our participation should be observable by the public to whom we are accountable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank all honourable members who have made a contribution to the debate on the Archives Amendment Bill, in particular the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the member for Tangney (Mr Williams). In response to some of the comments made by the member for Moore, I wish to place on the record that Australian Archives charges for the provision of photocopies of records. It does not charge for access to records by those who are able to visit the search rooms of Archives. However, Archives does have standards of service for customers beyond which it does not have the resources to proceed. Hence, if a researcher requires extensive research to be done and cannot visit the Archives, that person will have to engage the services of a professional researcher.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, that presents a problem to Australian Archives to provide a service of the kind that is sought by the member for Moore. One remedy Archives is examining is to microfilm the most important records so that copies can be made available in all offices of Archives and in some cases in public libraries. Nevertheless, the holdings of Archives are so vast that it can only ever hope to microfilm a small proportion of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the matter raised by the member for Tangney with respect to the implications of proposed new section 3A, I respond by saying that this matter has been discussed with the Secretary of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The point that the committee has made is clearly appreciated. Nevertheless, the power of regulation was inserted at the suggestion of the Attorney-General's Department. It is thought that this is the appropriate way to proceed. In so far as this method of procedure is concerned, the committee has been, or will be, advised that the power of regulation will be used judiciously and will not be used capriciously. I am sure that the member for Tangney is assured by that solemn undertaking by Australian Archives, given his extensive and eminent legal background. </PARA>
