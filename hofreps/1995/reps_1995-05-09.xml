<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, with indulgence, on behalf of the federal coalition I would like to welcome Andrew Thomson as the new member for Wentworth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would need to have been around here quite a long time to have known Sir John Bunting when he was an official. A number of members here, including the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), would have known him as an official. I think the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) may have. Some other people in the bureaucracy would have known him. Some members who have been here a long time would have known him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with sadness, certainly on behalf of the government and, I am sure, of the opposition, that I record the death of Sir John Bunting in Sydney on Tuesday, 2 May 1995 at the age of 76. Sir John Bunting was born in Ballarat, Victoria, in 1918. He was educated at Trinity Grammar School and later at Melbourne University, where he graduated in 1938 with a Bachelor of Arts, Honours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir John began his Public Service career in 1940 and served in successive positions with the Department of Trade and Customs and the Department of Post-war Reconstruction. He demonstrated a keen and meticulous approach to public service that gained him an envied reputation with superiors and colleagues alike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1950 Sir John was appointed to the Prime Minister's Department as assistant secretary. In a distinguished career he was made secretary to that department in 1959, a position he continued to hold until 1968. That is, he served Prime Minister Menzies for six years of the period of his prime ministership. From 1968 to 1971 Sir John served as Secretary to the Cabinet Office. From 1971 to January 1975 he again served as Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. He served successive Prime Ministers: Sir Robert Menzies, Harold Holt, John McEwen and, finally, Gough Whitlam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1975 Sir John left the Prime Minister's Department after being appointed to serve as High Commissioner in London. His service during his time there, until 1977, made him many friends and further established the high regard with which he was held in many quarters. Sir John was also Chairman of the Official Establishments Trust from 1983 to 1992, a position he held with great distinction, and National Coordinator of the Sir Robert Menzies Memorial Foundation from 1978. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For his distinguished service to the nation, Sir John was created a Knight Bachelor in 1964, a Knight of the Order of the British Empire in 1977 and he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir John will long be remembered for his professionalism, diligence and dedication to public service administration and for the impartiality that enabled him to serve successive governments with distinction, and, I might add, for his warmth and charm. Anybody who knew him liked him and respected him. He was one of those people in the Public Service who was well regarded and whose advice was often sought by people on both side of politics. He was always ready to give advice, even in later years. On behalf of the government, I extend to Lady Bunting and his sons, John, Peter and Richard, the government's most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Bennelong-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On indulgence, Mr Speaker, I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for the opportunity he has given the House to say something briefly about the death of one of Australia's greatest public servants. Sir John Bunting was, in every sense of the word, a pillar of the old Public Service. He was, as the Prime Minister said, an immensely charming and courteous man. I first met him before I entered federal parliament when, for a brief period when I was active in the Liberal Party organisation, I worked in the office of former Prime Minister McMahon at a time when Sir John Bunting was the permanent head of his department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the eight weeks before the 1972 election I had the opportunity to observe the extraordinary professionalism of this man and also his remarkable respect for the division that used to exist between the political arm and the professional public service arm of government. The meticulous way I heard him on occasions point out where it was proper for the Public Service to be involved in the lead-up to an election campaign and where it was not proper for the Public Service to be involved was a very early lesson to me of the old divisions that used to exist. The purpose of this very brief speech is not to talk about the rights and the wrongs of that but simply to observe that Sir John Bunting was a very eloquent exponent of the traditional approach&mdash;an approach which served both sides of politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the night of the 1972 election I had occasion to witness, as I was amongst the group that was with the then Prime Minister who was defeated in that election, a telephone call made by Sir John Bunting to offer his commiserations professionally for the defeat in the 1972 election. Immediately after that Sir Bunting said, `I will now be ringing Mr Whitlam, the Leader of the Opposition, to facilitate the transfer of government.' To me, that was a perfect demonstration of how the system ought to work. He played that out to the very end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir John Bunting was in the eyes of many people, and properly so, deeply associated with Sir Robert Menzies. He would have been regarded by many people in the Labor Party as being the epitome of a conservative bureaucrat who served through the long years of the coalition. But that did not blind him to the fact that he was, above all, a servant of Australia and that he served the will of the Australian people. He did that in a profoundly professional manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir John Bunting survived a few personal setbacks. When the now Sir John Gorton became Prime Minister in 1968, he brought about a significant rearrangement of the upper echelon of the Public Service, and Sir Lenox Hewitt effectively became the head of the Prime Minister's Department. In the eyes of many, Sir John Bunting was shunted sideways to head a newly created cabinet secretariat. But he continued to serve the government, the elected government of the people of Australia, and he did it with great professionalism. He returned to the position of head of the Prime Minister's Department after a change of leadership in the parliamentary Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He wrote a well researched and well reviewed little book regarding Sir Robert Menzies. He debunked a few of the myths that had surrounded the Menzies period of government. Nobody was better able to talk of that period than Sir John Bunting. Nobody was a more impartial observer, yet an intimate detailed observer, of the techniques of cabinet government under Menzies than was Sir John Bunting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir John, in that little monograph, did much to demolish the view that cabinet meetings presided over by Menzies were a monologue and debunked the view that Menzies imposed his view without let, hindrance, objection or obstruction from any of his colleagues. He did, as the Prime Minister said, take over as High Commissioner to London after serving the Whitlam government in its early period in office with utter professionalism and commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to note in several of the obituaries written about Sir John Bunting the warm fashion in which the former Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, spoke of Sir John and the way in which Sir John gave him honest advice of great integrity. If our public institutions mean anything, it is worth recording on occasions such as this the giants of the Public Service who serve both sides of politics so that whenever one thinks of the Public Service one instinctively, in this and the preceding generations, will think of Sir John Bunting and people like the late Sir Frederick Wheeler, Arthur Tange, Henry Bland, Roland Wilson and Sir James Plimsoll as being a unique band. </PARA>

Nugget Coombs certainly held many positions&mdash;and I acknowledge that. If my friend will allow me to say so, there was a degree of public partisanship about Nugget Coombs that we might not have found to the same degree with Sir John Bunting. I do not deny Coombs his right&mdash;but I think that is the difference, and any professional observer would have to acknowledge that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I extend my condolences to his family: his wife and three sons. On a personal note, my wife and I had the great privilege of getting to know one of his sons and that son's children. His grandson played in the same cricket team as my own son at Sydney Church of England Grammar School and we got to know that branch of the Bunting family very well. They are a fine family and they have every reason to be immensely proud of a great Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to speak in support of the condolence motion for Sir John Bunting, the former head of the Prime Minister's Department, a very senior federal public servant and a great Australian who had a particular and professional relationship with the late Sir John McEwen. There is a widespread disposition for public servants to be lampooned and categorised as being in some ways dull and lacking in ability. In many cases, this criticism is truly misplaced; in fact, unwarranted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir John Bunting was a good example of the quality that our public sector can aspire to. The work for which he was responsible required considerable skills in leadership, judgment and tact, and a large measure of discretion and dedication. Sir John belonged quite unmistakably to a particular era in public administration in Australia and no doubt gained from his rural upbringing his pragmatic approach to the important role he would take on in his later life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was the quintessential public servant, but not in a Sir Humphrey sense. In his book on Menzies, referred to by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and published in 1988, his deep respect for Prime Minister Menzies was apparent. At the same time, he did not allow his personal feelings to influence him. Rather, he was a true reflection of an Australian/Westminster public servant, neutral in his politics but with complete loyalty to the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As cabinet secretary during a period of great sensitivity and volatility, political as well as emotional in terms of Australia's involvement in the Vietnam conflict, Sir John had the complete confidence and trust of the cabinet. It is interesting that when Sir Lenox Hewitt became the head of the Prime Minister's Department, Sir John continued for a period as secretary to the cabinet. It is also interesting that Sir John Bunting worked for six Prime Ministers; from Sir Robert Menzies through to Gough Whitlam. Rather than seeing himself as an extension of the Prime Minister, he saw himself as serving the cabinet as a whole and being the interpreter of collective executive government. He had many ideas as to how the cabinet government and the form and modus operandi of cabinet government might further evolve and be modernised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The death of Sir John is a sad passing. Together with the recent death of Sir Geoffrey Yeend and others, it brings to an end a particular era of truly professional administrators, not bound by personal or political considerations but representing the traditional values of a non-partisan public service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he was packing up his house, he chose to make one more gesture to the community and gave many of his books over to a school here in Canberra. Some of them had inscriptions of quite a valuable nature from senior US administration officials and others. It was part of his common touch. Whilst he knew from his work so many important people around the world and here in Australia, he was nevertheless unaffected and determined to continue to make a contribution in his retirement. I extend to Lady Bunting and members of the Bunting family the sympathy of members of the parliamentary National Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I would like to extend my thanks to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), as did the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), for making this condolence motion possible. In today's age, there are few like the late Sir John Bunting. He was remarkable in the ways that have been described and in a number of respects. Like most members of the House, I sat at many cabinet meetings with Sir John Bunting there. He was wise in his counsel, solicitous in his advice and always spoke from a perspective which made you think the arguments you presented were correct. Whether or not the point of view that he presented was one you endorsed, being questioned about the reasons that you put in matters of high policy is the essence of good government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir John Bunting was a great public servant, as he has been described. He was a great individual in many ways, and the contribution he made towards the reputation of the Australian civil service is something that should also be mentioned. There was a generation that certainly set a standard which all those who became servants of the state in this country could well have aspired to emulate. I do not think any set a higher standard than Sir John. To his wife and family, Rosemary and I would also like to extend our sympathy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I would like to speak for a moment in a personal nature. It was my good fortune to serve with Sir John for a period of years while we were both in Canberra. When he went to London as High Commissioner, it was my good fortune to renew a personal association which lasted till very recently. One thing that has not been mentioned by any of the speakers to date is the fact that in his latter years he had very bad health. He had voice trouble, which he overcame with great difficulty and great determination. All the wonderful things that have been said about him have been great, but he was a very personal man and a very concerned man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have talked about what he said. The night that we lost government he asked whether he could come to the dinner that McMahon was putting on for his staff and spouses. Sir John mentioned at that dinner that history would show Mr McMahon to be one of the most Australian of Prime Ministers we had ever had, certainly up until that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is wonderful that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and you, Mr Speaker, have allowed us to pay tribute to him.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I would like to join with those who have spoken so far in paying tribute to the life of Sir John Bunting. Perhaps in some of the remarks thus far made there is a slight tinge of pessimism about whether or not the standards that were set in place by some of the great creators of the Australian Public Service, of which Sir John was one, are perhaps now honoured more in the breach than in the observance. I do not think that is actually true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the position established for the Australian Public Service in the times in which Sir John was such a prominent member by and large remain to be the circumstances today. That is not necessarily so of state administrations, but I think it is so of the national government. That it is so of the national government is in no small measure due to the effectiveness with which Sir John and others organised the Australian state. We are a creation of the period Sir John was in the Australian Public Service&mdash;the period from the 1940s onwards in which the modern Australian state was established. The relationships between government and the Australian Public Service were established at that point of time. It was also coincidental with the development of the city of Canberra and the gradual centralisation of administration in this city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir John presided over a great deal of that, and he did so in a way that belies the traditional image presented in the media and comedy shows, the more formal media presentation of the traditional public servant or mandarin. He had a great deal of human sympathy and warmth, and a great deal of integrity. There was nothing underhand in the positions that he adopted and his presentation of the issues to government that I have ever heard. My father knew him well too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a personal note, it is with great sadness that I read of his death. He and Lady Peggy were enormously kind to me when I was a student in England. I have many fond memories of those occasions and subsequent to my being in parliament and my election to parliament. In particular, I want to extend my sympathies to Lady Peggy, John, Peter and Richard, his sons, and their families. I know the enormous affection in which he was held by them. The loss to them over the next week or two will be so very extreme. I think of them very much at this time. I believe his reputation will stand for a very long period because of what he and others who have been mentioned here created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I also draw attention to one other matter. Despite the fact that those proper relationships were established between the political and administrative side of government, it is important to note the extent to which he developed a personal, not a clinical, affection for the ministers and prime ministers with whom he dealt. Gough Whitlam has already attested to that, as mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in what he has had to say. Nothing could be more evident of that fact than the reminiscences of Sir John himself about Sir Robert Menzies, who was Prime Minister for the greater bulk of the period that he himself was a senior public servant. While the relationships were always proper, you could not read that book and assume that there was not being extended to the political class as well as the administrative class a very substantial degree of the warmth and sympathy of which he was capable. He will be a much missed person by his family and a much missed person by this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join others in supporting the condolences for Sir John Bunting, who, as has been said, was a truly great Australian public servant. I knew him through my father, who had a very close relationship with him and a great respect for him. My father was a minister in the Menzies government which Sir John served as a distinguished public servant. As others have said&mdash;this is worth repeating and repeating a lot&mdash;he was a public servant in the great traditions of an impartial public servant. I think the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) made an interesting point. Despite that, he was able to form very close personal relationships with many of the ministers no doubt on both sides of politics. Certainly, that was the experience of my own father. I agree with the Leader of the House that there are still public servants who have carried on that great tradition. Tony Cole is certainly a recent example of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note something that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said, that Sir John Bunting did have a very difficult time on occasions as a senior public servant. I can remember my father being absolutely outraged when Sir John Bunting was removed from the position of Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to become the Secretary to the Cabinet and replaced in his previous position by Sir Lenox Hewitt. This was no reflection on Sir Lenox Hewitt in particular&mdash;I choose my words carefully here&mdash;but certainly the notion of Sir John Bunting being perceived to be inadequate for the task was regarded by many who had worked close to him as simply extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also had a bit to do with Sir John Bunting during his time as High Commissioner in London. He had some health problems during that time but, despite that, served in that role with great distinction and, I think, held the name of Australia with great dignity. There was in Sir John Bunting none of the Anglophobe that we might find in some parts of our country but there was no tugging of the forelock either. I thought he handled that job with great distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, too, find his book on Sir Robert Menzies an important contribution. I think he did a lot to change altogether the perception that was once around that Menzies was some sort of dictatorial tyrant in his cabinet, that his government was a one-man government. The book was one of several contributions which have finally dispelled that view and brought the truth closer to what Australia now understands to be the case. </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the First Home Owners Act 1983 and related legislation (the Home Deposit Assistance Act 1982, the Homes Savings Grant Act 1964, the Homes Savings Grant Act 1976). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, I would like to explain the provisions of the bill in relation to the Housing Assistance Act 1989. The government is unequivocally committed to the principle that housing is a basic human right and that all governments have a responsibility to ensure the housing needs of all Australians are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of this commitment the Commonwealth provides untied financial assistance to the states under the Housing Assistance Act 1989 to deliver housing assistance, predominantly for building or purchase of public rental housing stock but also for home purchase, in accordance with the terms of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. The current CSHA is at schedule 1 of the existing act; the CSHA is up for renegotiation with the aim of having a new agreement in place by 1 July 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSHA requires states to match Commonwealth untied assistance on a dollar for dollar basis, with at least half of the matching provided through state grants and the balance through the value of loans made under home purchase assistance schemes. Difficulties with matching have arisen in recent years for states as a result of increased attractiveness of commercially available loans in the current economic climate and a poor public image for some state products, leading most states to reduce their home lending activities. The affected states have been unable to provide additional grant funding to meet their matching obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to amendments made to the act last year, the Commonwealth was required to recover financial assistance provided in earlier years from states that did not undertake sufficient lending under their home purchase assistance&mdash;HPA&mdash;schemes. Similarly, where some states indicated that they were unlikely to be able to meet their matching requirements, the act, prior to amendment, required that the minister not provide unmatched funds, reducing untied grants to the level that would be matched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considered that either to recover financial assistance already provided or to reduce funding to be provided was undesirable. It would reduce funds for public housing and disadvantage those most in need of assistance. It would also be undesirable to pursue such action where states are genuinely unable to meet such requirements because of changed market conditions. It was for these reasons that the amendments to section 15 of the act which allowed the minister to waive these provisions were made last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not expected at the time of the previous amendments that states would continue to have matching difficulties. The amendments outlined in this bill extend these waiving provisions for what is expected to be the final and seventh year of the current Commonwealth-state housing agreement:</PARA>
<PARA>.The amendment to subsection 15(2A) of the act extends its application to the seventh grant year (1995-96) in addition to the sixth grant year (1994-95) of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">-Subsection 15(2A) of the act enables the Commonwealth minister to authorise the full level of untied grants to a particular state, even if the minister cannot ensure that the state can meet the balance of its matching obligation from the value of home loans provided through its home purchase assistance programs in accordance with paragraph 13(2)(b) of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>.The amendment to subsection 15A(2) of the act extends section 15A to the seventh grant year (1995-96) in addition to the fifth (1993-94) and sixth grant years (1994-95) of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">-Section 15A enables the minister to make a determination to effectively waive or reduce a state or territory's obligation to match the balance of untied assistance, provided by the Commonwealth to a state, from the value of home loans provided through home purchase assistance programs in a grant year where that state has not been able to meet the level required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any decision to waive or reduce the home purchase assistance matching requirement will be taken after careful consideration of the circumstances leading to the need for such a course of action and determined on a case by case basis. The longer term issue of matching will be addressed in the process of renegotiating a new Commonwealth-state housing agreement. The amendments will not result in any additional Commonwealth outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to turn to the provisions of the bill relevant to the First Home Owners Act 1983 and related legislation. In the budget speech of 21 August 1990, the government announced its decision to terminate the first home owners scheme as part of its plan to restructure Commonwealth home ownership assistance arrangements. Legislation was introduced amending the First Home Owners Act 1983 so that it would not have effect in respect of homes acquired after that date. That legislation also fixed 30 June 1991 as the last date for applications for assistance under the act. However, applicants coming within those deadlines remained eligible for a stream of monthly assistance payments over five years from the date of acquiring their home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments in 1994 to the first home owners regulations allowed final payments to remaining eligible clients to be aggregated and brought forward. The bulk of these payments were dispatched in November 1994, and after 30 June 1995 there will be ongoing administrative activity only of a minor nature. Accordingly, this bill amends the reporting requirements of the act to provide that no annual report on its administration and operation will be required after the 1994-95 report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently, no time limit is prescribed in the act for appeals from decisions made under it. To assist in winding up the scheme's administration, this bill sets 30 June 1995&mdash;but we will have a government amendment to move the date to 31 August 1995&mdash;as the cut-off date for such appeals. For the few appealable decisions which may be made close to that date or thereafter, a period of 28 days from the date the decision is furnished to the applicant is proposed. Further, the bill curtails the power of the secretary to the department to reopen applications for reconsideration after that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notifications of decisions under the First Home Owners Act have always been required to include an explanation of the client's right to seek review, including by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Few decisions have been made since the two years after the cut-off date for applications. With few exceptions, applicants now have had a number of years to consider decisions affecting them and to lodge an appeal. It is now time to draw this scheme to a close. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, any decisions still to be made will be subject to the proposed 28-day limit to seek departmental review; the existing right and time limit will continue to apply for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from decisions of the department. Similarly, the legislation does not affect the review procedures available to individuals under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also add that the government will undertake appropriate action to notify clients of the time lines for the revised review procedures. This will involve advertisements in national newspapers over a two-week period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier first home ownership assistance schemes are governed by the 1964 and 1976 Home Savings Grants Acts and the Home Deposit Assistance Act 1982. These, too, contain no time limits for appeals from decisions made under them. Accordingly, to assist in winding up their administration, the bill proposes arrangements similar to those proposed for the First Home Owners Act 1983. The bill also incorporates machinery amendments to the provisions of the earlier acts relating to making and notification of decisions under them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from modest costs associated with the campaign to publicise the cut-off date for appeals, the amendments to the first home owners assistance legislation have no identifiable financial impact. I commend this bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Housing Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 is a result of a budget decision made by the Hawke Labor government in its 1990 budget where it decided to abolish the first home owners scheme. The bill amends the First Home Owners Act 1983 and related legislation and the Housing Assistance Act 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the First Home Owners Act remove the requirement in the First Home Owners Act 1983 to report to parliament beyond the 1994-95 annual report. The bill also has provisions related to the setting of cut-off dates for consideration of, and appeal from, decisions made under the act. The formal cut-off date is set for 30 June 1995. The bill also incorporates equivalent amendments to the earlier first home owners assistance legislation being the Home Savings Grants Act 1964, the Home Savings Grants Act 1976 and the Home Deposit Assistance Act 1982. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill then amends the Housing Assistance Act 1989 to permit the Commonwealth minister to authorise and provide up to the full level of Commonwealth funding in the seventh and expected final grant year of 1995-96 of the current Commonwealth-state housing agreement in circumstances where a state has been, or will be, unable to meet its obligations under that agreement to match up to half of the untied grants from the value of home loans made under home purchase assistance programs. The coalition will not be opposing the bill as we have consistently believed that the principle behind the devolution of the first home owners scheme to the states is correct and that these amendments are only to finalise a process begun by the First Home Owners Amendment Act 1990, which we did not oppose at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perhaps opportune on this budget day that we do, however, take the time to reflect on this government's callous disregard for those Australians who are trying to own their own home. The hypocrisy of Labor and its approach to housing is measured by contrasting its policy position with reality. The Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe), has sought to develop a set of policies around the national housing strategy albeit without any great success. Hal Bisset, a director of the Ecumenical Housing Unit, commented recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is impossible to achieve the national housing strategy's overall objectives of affordable and appropriate housing if the economy is not managed so as to reinforce these outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand, the impact of the housing market on the broader economy has not been given adequate attention either.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister's response to the housing objectives has always been to have yet another inquiry or propose another strategy. The response, of course, of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the needs and aims of those in this country who are purchasing their first home or who are saving, I might add, for their first home has been to create an economy whereby his wilful disregard of sound economic judgment has resulted in an interest rate spiral. By failing to implement policies that could have reigned in our burgeoning current account deficit, this Prime Minister has directly caused an entire industry to go into a downward spiral of growing proportions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the period from March 1994 to March 1995 the number of dwelling units approved monthly fell from 15,636 per month in March 1994 to 12,830 in the month of March 1995 in seasonally adjusted terms. Likewise, the value of building approvals fell from $2,163 million in March 1994 to $2,124 million in March 1995. Building commencements in the March quarter 1994 in seasonally adjusted terms were 44,887, a figure which has fallen in the December quarter of 1994 to 44,236. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps where we can see most directly the impact of the patchwork policies of this government is in the dramatic fall in secured housing finance commitments. In seasonally adjusted terms the value of secured finance commitments has fallen from the sum of $4.291 billion in February 1994 to $3.165 billion in February 1995. This fall of over $1 billion in secured housing finance commitments is a direct reflection of the disastrous interest rate policies of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect on the housing and construction industry is yet to be fully felt, but when this pain spreads throughout the economy we will see the reflection of this Prime Minister's callous policies and of the lack of ability of the Deputy Prime Minister to properly argue his portfolio in cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government was and is unable to keep the lid on interest rates so as to enable the housing industry to continue to grow at the same rate as the rest of the economy. It is only with the steady and sustained growth of this industry that the economy will be able to provide affordable housing to those in the community that still require housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition under the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is committed to the establishment of a flexible, balanced and responsive housing sector which can deliver home ownership as a real choice and provide alternative options for those who choose not to own or whose circumstances prevent them from owning their own home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policies of this government are strangling the housing industry, as the figures I have just quoted amply illustrate. The coalition is committed to providing home ownership as a real choice for all Australians. This government seems committed to pursuing policies that disadvantage low and middle income earners from achieving the goal of owning their own home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will develop innovative reforms of financial arrangements in partnership with financial and industry groups in order to assist home buyers and not leave the first home buyer and those in the community that wish to move up the scale in their choice of a home, or those who because of circumstances have to move location, to the vagaries of the financial market&mdash;a market that is directly affected by this government's reckless high interest rate policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be derelict of me in the context of this debate if I did not refer to the government's overall economic strategy&mdash;I can loosely refer to it as that&mdash;and the outlook for those who wish to own their own first home but who by employment circumstances are forced to move locations and thus purchase another home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor government has failed a number of tests. One test we all know it has failed is that of truth. Remember the tax cuts that were l-a-w that turned out to be l-i-e-s. No doubt this government's credibility will take another nosedive when the Treasurer (Mr Willis) puffs out some more smoke, the Prime Minister adjusts the mirrors and the acolytes preach to all and sundry what a great show it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you and the Australian people know that what is being perpetrated by this government is a series of clever little con tricks. Remember the admission of former Treasurer Dawkins that he fudged the figures and the startling revelations made last night by the former head of Treasury on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program that One Nation, the first key financial initiative of this Prime Minister, was patched together with deception. That is the mark of his politically and morally bankrupt party. It can no longer look the people of Australia in the eye and deliver a policy. All it can do is try to deceive the people. This cheap and tawdry little group will tonight drag out smart lines and try to deceive the people of this great country once again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we consider that we have some 800,000 people unemployed and a housing industry that is in decline as a direct result of the high interest rate policies of this government, all we can say about this government's approach to those at the lower end of the income scale is that it is consistent in its callous disregard for those unemployed who may own their own home but are forced to sell either by virtue of the lack of income or the burden of increased interest rates. What will happen in the future? The only certainty that the Labor government offers the community is that there will be more pain. The Labor boom-bust policies are a recipe for high unemployment and the type of environment that robs those who are seeking to own their own home the chance of achieving that dream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the coalition does not oppose this legislation, it reminds the people of Australia that this government failed to keep its 1993 election promise of keeping home purchases within the reach of those who want to buy their own homes and keeping mortgage payments at affordable levels. This is just another example of deception from a government that can no longer distinguish truth from fiction&mdash;a fact that no doubt we will see again tonight in the government's 13th box of tricks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. The bill is straightforward and makes minor amendments to two acts&mdash;the First Home Owners Act 1983 and other related legislation and the Housing Assistance Act 1989. The amendments to the First Home Owners Act 1983 are designed, firstly, to remove the statutory reporting requirements once the scheme is terminated&mdash;this has already been referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Ms Crawford)&mdash;and, secondly, to ensure that the possibility for review of the decisions made under this act does not continue beyond the life of the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a historical point of view, the first home owners scheme has had a great degree of success in putting Australians into their first homes. It was first established under the First Home Owners Act 1983. There were several forerunner schemes that were similar in intent to that of the First Home Owners Act 1983. I am referring here to the schemes established under the Homes Savings Act 1964, the Home Savings Grant Act 1976 and the Home Deposit Assistance Act 1982. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These schemes, along with the first home owners scheme, were important vehicles for channelling assistance to low and middle income earners in the market to enable them to buy their first homes. These schemes that operated in the 1970s and 1980s not only had an important social purpose but also had an economic focus. They were aimed at stimulating dwelling construction in the building industry and creating jobs. The schemes were very important to the creation of employment in regional areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The housing market&mdash;as well as the economic circumstances&mdash;has changed and that has challenged the relevancy of the schemes in today's economic and social environment. These changes have necessitated the redirection of housing policy that was enunciated by the government in 1990 and that has led to a substantial restructuring of the home ownership assistance arrangements and a termination of the first home ownership scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistics relating to the first home ownership scheme, for the period of its operation from 1983-84 to 1993-94, show that some 369,400 applications were approved and some $1.5 billion paid out in assistance. The long and short of it is that many Australians have been assisted into their first homes by these types of schemes. But circumstance has changed and with it the delivery of housing assistance to Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of this legislation relates to changes in the Housing Assistance Act of 1989. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development canvassed some of those changes in her address. The Housing Assistance Act of 1989 outlined the Commonwealth's financial assistance to the states for housing. In the 1992-93 budget, the government announced an extension of the guaranteed funding under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in this bill will release the states from the requirement to match half the Commonwealth's untied grants. With interest rates at low levels, the states have found it difficult to maintain their levels of spending on housing programs and the Commonwealth does not wish to penalise the states for factors beyond their control. The changes to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement and the first home owners scheme are expected to be close to revenue neutral with only minor financial outlays involved in these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker in this debate, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), made reference to the government's housing policies and rather denigrated the government's achievements of the past decade. For the benefit of the House, and to set the record straight, I ought to canvass some of the philosophical underpinning of the government's housing policy and outline the successes that the government has achieved over the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is committed to the provision of affordable housing. That is at the core of this government's social justice agenda. Social justice is a term with which the opposition has some trouble coming to grips. It is not part of the opposition's policy apparati. It is not a focus of its policies. Certainly, many of the opposition's policies have an economic focus but do not have a social one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of affordable housing to Australians is at the core of the Labor Party government's social justice agenda and social policies. This government is unequivocally committed to the principle that housing is a basic human right and that all governments have a responsibility to ensure that the housing needs of all Australians are met. The government is committed to ensuring that Australians have the right of access to secure, good quality housing that is appropriate to their needs, that is well located for current employment opportunities and that is obtainable at an affordable price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular philosophical position contrasts markedly with that of the coalition, which seems to have the rather naive view of the world that the marketplace can address the diverse housing needs of the Australian people. The simple fact is that the market cannot by itself deliver the economic and social outcomes necessary in this area of social policy. As far as Labor's housing record is concerned, I can stand here with a great deal of pride in the achievements of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to hear members of the opposition talk about the affordability of housing in Australia. At present we have in place a low interest rate regime compared with that which we have seen historically. We also have the lowest level of inflation in the Western world. Those two elements have put housing affordability within the reach of many ordinary Australians. It is particularly galling that members of the opposition talk in this place about the government limiting the opportunities of Australians to gain access to affordable housing. They must have short memories or some of them must not have been around this place for too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not been around this place for too long but I have a long memory. I can remember the stewardship of the Australian economy by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and the impact that had on the affordability of housing for Australians. In 1982, the honourable member for Bennelong presided over mortgage interest rates in the region of 13.5 per cent and an inflation rate which was crippling the building industry, amongst others. The building industry price index rose traditionally above the consumer price index. I note that when the honourable member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition, left office the inflation rate was in the region of 11.5 per cent. Try affording a house in a private marketplace with interest rates at 13.5 per cent and an inflation rate of 11.5 per cent. That was Honest John's contribution to the Australian economy and to housing affordability for the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last decade we have seen, as a consequence of the deregulation of the home finance market, a broadening of the range of institutions that are providing housing finance. We have also seen the presentation of a greater diversity of housing products to consumers. The end result has been clear: housing affordability has improved; there is greater consumer choice in the marketplace; and a broader range of financial institutions are providing housing finance to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party, which is in government, has always had a very strong commitment to public housing. The previous speaker in this debate, the honourable member for Forrest, ought to reflect on the record of previous Liberal governments and their weak and insipid commitments to public housing in this country. We have a traditional, very proud and honourable commitment to public housing in this country. Under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, the government is providing over $3 billion to the states for public housing. This amount will be provided over three years to June 1996. By 1996 this investment will help increase total public housing units to an estimated 400,000 units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the opposition promise when it went before the Australian population at the general election in 1993? Those opposite had a very powerful commitment to public housing in this country. They wanted to slash $400 million off it. Not only did those opposite want to suck that important amount of money out of the Australian economy at a time when it was cranking into gear, but the implications of their policy were also such that the level of public housing constructed in this country would have been reduced. We know the weak-kneed commitment of those opposite to public housing. They have articulated it at elections and in this House. I am merely pointing out to members of the opposition that we have a proud record of achievement in the public housing area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will be aware that the Commonwealth-state housing agreement is currently being  renegotiated with the states. I am hopeful that that renegotiation will bring reforms, even reforms which will be accepted by conservative state governments, which will improve the efficiency of resource allocation in the housing area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) for his deep commitment to the social objectives of the Labor Party in government and for the manner in which he has handled his portfolio. One honourable member opposite criticised Labor Party ministers, and in particular the Deputy Prime Minister. I have not heard any program for housing and regional development articulated by those opposite. I have not seen a genuine reform agenda that is going to expand the options for public housing and the private rental market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the problem with the opposition. Those opposite have no vision of what governments can achieve. They have this rather pathetic attachment to an ideological position that attempts to reduce government involvement in these very important areas. Apart from the health of Australians, housing is the most critical area for governments to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the government's record in the public housing area. The government's funding for public housing has enabled the number of new tenants houses to increase from 35,000 in 1982-83 to over 54,000 in 1993-94. The government has been addressing the issue of homeless people in this society. Since we came to power we have seen a 300 per cent increase in investment in accommodation and related support services for homeless Australians. Every night over 7,000 homeless Australians are accommodated in premises which have been provided under a Labor government program&mdash;the supported accommodation assistance program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995 the Keating government built on this strong record with the introduction of a new piece of social justice legislation in the area of homelessness&mdash;the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1995. The government provided $20 million in the 1994-95 budget to implement the new SAAP agreements. This funding will ensure that case management has been introduced into SAAP, that better services are provided to homeless people with mental illness, that better national data is collected to measure the performance of the program, and that a national community awareness campaign will be launched to highlight the problems associated with homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to other elements of Labor's housing agenda. We have provided significant funding&mdash;in the region of $1.73 billion&mdash;for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander accommodation. In the area of women escaping domestic violence, we have provided some $50 million under SAAP and we have funded 380 services in this area. We have introduced a strategy to provide new homes for the young and the old. This is all part of a broad agenda which this Labor government addresses through the budgetary mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The housing industry is extremely important to regional economies such as Geelong. Over the past few years, housing in Geelong has remained affordable, prices have remained low, and there is a steady increase in the availability of public and low cost housing to low income people. However, we have problems with public housing waiting lists. There is a serious shortage of crisis accommodation for homeless men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Housing statistics for Geelong show that housing prices have remained static for almost six years but that rental prices are also static or falling. Figures released earlier this year showed that Geelong had the greatest number of rental properties in regional Victoria and that the cost of renting a house in Geelong had fallen some 3.7 per cent. In a recent survey undertaken by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Personal Investment</EMPHASIS> magazine, these figures placed Geelong fourth among the top 20 capital and regional cities for affordable and low cost housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public housing stock in Geelong is steadily increasing. One of the more successful projects was the public housing development in Norlane, which received $5.3 million through the government's better cities funding. This was the first project of its type in the state and was a joint development with the private sector. The project saw the removal of old-style cement sheet public housing for an equivalent number of modern public housing dwellings and the same number again of modern units for private sale aimed at the lower end of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major housing market problem in Geelong at this point in time is the lack of adequate shelter for homeless men. I am pleased to say that a working group has been established in Geelong to tackle the problem, which was exacerbated nearly a year ago by the closure of the St Vincent shelter for homeless men. The Barwon Region Housing Council today launched a homeless males fund to help tackle the problem and local hotels and caravan parks have agreed to assist the fund, which will operate on a voucher system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional areas, such as the one I represent, are not immune from the problems that face ordinary Australians across the length and breadth of this country as far as access to affordable and decent housing is concerned. But there is one thing they can be assured of: Labor members, when they come to this House, are committed to the great principles that underpin and have driven the policies of this government over the past decade and that will underpin the budget commitment which the government will make later on this evening to public housing and the broader housing agenda in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a record that the opposition cannot hope to match in its wildest dreams: it cannot hope to match it as it does not have a vision of the industry and where it ought to go; it cannot hope to match it if it does not have an articulated deep concern that all Australians should have access to affordable and decent housing; and it will never have the same commitment as that of the Labor Party in government as long as it puts before the Australian people a housing policy program that sees enormous chunks being clawed out of the public housing resource provision that is made available under the federal budget. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great pleasure in joining with my colleague the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) in not only supporting the provisions of this legislation but also strongly supporting the record and agenda of our Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe). He is an effective politician and minister because he not only looks at the short-term agenda but also takes a longer view of changes in the housing market, changes in demographics and changes in the responsibilities of the federal government. Under this government he, along with his parliamentary secretary, is developing a very effective agenda for private and public housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Housing Legislation Amendment Bill is part of that agenda. The first of its primary provisions is to assist in winding up the first home owners scheme. That scheme was established in 1983 and its abolition was announced in the 1990 budget. The final entitlements for that scheme are due for payment in July 1995. The second provision in this legislation is to change the methods of payment to the states for public housing under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two provisions&mdash;one relating to the private housing sector, the other relating to the public housing sector&mdash;raise the whole question of Minister Howe's very broad agenda for housing reform throughout the country. It is an agenda that essentially relates to three questions. The first is affordability; that is, rent assistance&mdash;establishing a benchmark for rent assistance in Australia that provides all Australians, no matter their location or income, with affordable housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the agenda involves renewing public housing capital stock; this relates to livability and the way in which public housing has been allowed to run down for many years under state authorities. Quality of life can be enhanced by sensible capital renewal programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third item on the agenda is establishing a more efficient housing and urban form and more efficient cities in Australia. The best known area-based urban intervention sponsored by the minister is the Building Better Cities Program. I have nothing but praise for the minister, his active agenda and broad conceptual approach to housing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Urban planning and housing, which are among the disciplines of public policy in the 1990s, fall into one of the most dynamic areas of study and policy formulation. There is a challenge on both sides of the House to stay ahead of the development of academic work, changes in urban form and changes in economic development that drive urban form and how that relates to the key objectives of affordability and liveability in housing Australians throughout the nation. These questions have at their heart key planning issues that are now more than ever coming on to the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was recently pleased that one of the state members of parliament within my electorate&mdash;Craig Knowles, the member for Moorebank&mdash;was appointed by the new Carr Labor government in New South Wales as the Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs. He has an opportunity&mdash;I have discussed this with the new minister&mdash;to transform the way in which planning and housing settlement have been looked at and developed in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The traditional method of planning&mdash;this is reflected in the former government's metropolitan planning strategy&mdash;is to start with a population settlement target. One starts with a number of people that are projected to move into an area such as Sydney over the next decade or so. Land use plans are developed in response to this population settlement target. Out of that, transport corridors are developed. Employment zones are a third order consideration. Retail and industrial colours are drawn in on the planning map.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This approach enables governments to muddle through in a closed economy. Methods of protection and industry subsidisation offer a guide to investment patterns. But it is much harder to sustain the traditional method of planning in an effective fashion under an internationally exposed trading environment. Our economy is currently subjected to two layers of restructuring. The first one is opening up the economy and working out the things we do well. We identify the industries that are competitive and shake out the industries that are not so competitive. The second layer is moving progressively to knowledge based industries and forms of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Restructuring the economy relates very much to these questions of urban planning. It is turning on its head the way in which plans should be addressing these disciplines. It is very hard to knock the market out of the ring. Under an open economy, market forces and investment forces in a regional or metropolitan economy, such as Sydney's, are driving the urban form. Planners should adjust and no longer use long lag time policy instruments. They are not suitable when investment is changing so rapidly. They should try to restructure the way in which urban planning is undertaken. That means working out the likely scenarios for investment movements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The internationalised economy&mdash;the global village&mdash;and improvements in communications and transport are rapidly  changing the sort of urban form and planning imperatives that we face in Australia. The need for planners is to now reverse the methodology. They should no longer start with population and then move to transport and employment considerations. They should start with projections about patterns of employment and industry investment. Around them, they should then build the land use and transport planning imperatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very important. If we do not do that, we get inefficient results at the urban level. This can result in a dislocation between population and employment opportunities, long commuter travelling times, high costs of infrastructure, urban sprawl and a run-down in environmental standards. So there is a need for planners to get the efficiency right&mdash;to get the planning imperatives right in the first instance&mdash;and make sure that the inefficiencies do not translate into poor outcomes that have adverse results in social justice terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard, I will quote from a document prepared by Mark Spiller from the Queensland Department of Housing, Local Government and Planning. It was presented to the Better Cities seminar on urban change in action, in Parliament House on 27 March. I know that these matters are of great interest to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Ms Crawford), who is at the table, because they relate to the very interesting things being done by the Queensland government in better planning and housing settlement in south-east Queensland. I will quote from Mr Spiller's paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other things equal, those economies with better structured cities will be more competitive. The most obvious reason for this is that a range of production costs will be lower for a given level of output. Because of the incremental nature of urban growth and the slow ratcheting up of associated costs, this seemingly obvious point is not always well understood by policy makers. Exercises which project key costs over a relatively long period can be instructive in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The South East Queensland 2001 regional planning process compared a "trend" development scenario at the end of a 20 year period with a "preferred" scenario. The analysis showed the regional economy would, each year, carry additional "overheads" of $1 billion in vehicle operating costs alone under the no change management strategy. Average journey to work times would be almost 50% greater and vehicle emissions would be 37% higher. Scaling up such costs to the national level suggests that the returns from improved management of the urban settlement pattern would easily be of the same order as those flowing from full implementation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hilmer</EMPHASIS> reforms in the electricity, water, transport and other utility sectors.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quiet interesting that the Queensland government is undertaking that planning strategy. It is not being caught in short-termism but is replicating the model promoted by the minister in this place and taking a long-term perspective. It understands that a more efficient and consolidated urban form has a range of economic as well as social benefits through all parts of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a close correlation between employment opportunities and housing locations, obviously there are huge social benefits. If there is a reduction in commuter travelling times, there are financial, social and environmental benefits, because lengthy commuter travelling time in Australia is usually reflected in unsatisfactory air emissions and other forms of pollution. This is the agenda that is being developed by the Queensland government, and I congratulate it for its long-term planning and its appreciation of the very important link between employment, urban form land use and transport needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is projected that in south-east Queensland there will be a three per cent infrastructure cost saving, compared to conventional low density sprawl and inefficient models of urban development. If the savings from urban efficiency from better pricing signals, innovative land and housing development and better planning all round were captured nationwide, savings in the low hundreds of millions of dollars per annum could be realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not something just for social planners, community workers or environmentalists to be interested in; it is for finance ministers as well. This more efficient form of urban planning and urban form has benefits across a range of government and social responsibilities. Cost pricing of infrastructure and services associated with land and housing development are a very useful location signal to the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adjustments to pricing policies&mdash;such as taxation reform&mdash;represent an electorally sensitive exercise. The anguish of those disaffected by reform always seems to outweigh the support of the beneficiaries. Long-term planning and more efficient pricing of urban outcomes is not an easy task. Taking a long-term view in politics often means that short-term political imperatives can cause difficulties, but the long-term issues are fundamental to a successful outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Planning strategies need to confirm the benefits of full cost recovery on land development. There is no stronger mechanism than pricing to slow the rate of unsatisfactory urban sprawl. In this regard, the 1992 New South Wales Treasury research paper on public authority pricing in New South Wales set out the correct principles for pricing construction and the use of physical infrastructure. There is a lot of debate on these questions at the current time because of the COAG agenda on competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This paper that was produced three years ago is a very useful document. I think it provides a guide for all governments and all agencies within government on the sorts of pricing policies that should be adopted on urban form. New South Wales Treasury said that prices should generally have an access and usage component reflecting the nature of the cost borne by agencies. They should be sufficiently high to allow rate of return targets to be met. Price reform should desirably be part of the productivity compact with the service agencies so there is a quid pro quo between the pace of price reform&mdash;which helps agencies on the revenue side&mdash;and their requirements to minimise costs to home buyers, consumers and businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, many customers&mdash;including future generations and taxpayers generally&mdash;will be better off as a result of price reform. That is reflected in the large savings on infrastructure costs that can be made from more efficient urban form. The gains are apparent, both financially and in terms of the quality of service and environmental amenities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where there are genuine hardship cases, which will depend on the pace of reform, the extent of such an impact needs to be quantified and assessed in terms of the need of compensatory measures&mdash;that is, in Australia's case, arranging explicit community service obligation payments on those pricing policies. Under Australia's federal system of government it is very difficult to manage the compensatory arrangements they have in New Zealand, for instance, where social security is part of the national government, as are the urban agencies. In Australia we have federal responsibilities for social security where compensation could be made for pricing policies at full cost while the states are in control of the key urban agencies. This is another vital issue for the COAG agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to understand how the equity arguments about full cost recovery extend beyond a narrow focus on price increases. The report of the human services working group to the Sydney Metropolitan Strategy Review Task Force&mdash;and this goes back to August 1992&mdash;made a crucial point. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New estates are no longer predominantly accommodating first home buyers. There is now no justification on equity grounds to subsidise human services provision at the expense of other higher need areas. Second home buyers in new estates are now doubly subsidised, having profited from selling houses in more established areas where the value of infrastructure and locational amenity are contained in the selling price, they are moving to new estates where they pay less than half the cost of providing the infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important point that needs to be appreciated. In Australia, in the 1990s, first home buyers are not necessarily located predominantly on the urban fringe. The pattern is moving from established suburbs, where they had their first home, to a better house on the urban fringe. So the policy makers who in previous decades assumed that housing policy needed to be geared around the great Australian dream of home ownership on the urban fringe need to rethink the imperatives and the market realities of housing settlement patterns in Australia at the moment. This is a reason why the government in 1990 announced the end of that first home buyers subsidised scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to adapt to a whole range of new planning realities. There is talk of the information superhighway. The advent of telecommuting, home shopping and other home based services will change the nature of the transport task. If people work out of home using advanced information technology, then we will have the great potential for more efficient urban form and housing settlement, lower cost to government and less environmental decay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument in a service based economy is that the transport infrastructure is not as important as it was. This is the difference between the information revolution, where information and advanced information technology carries the work material, and the Industrial Revolution, out of which arose the method of a production based economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to some of the more specific details of Brian Howe's reform agenda. I support each of them in turn and, firstly, accept the recommendation of the Industry Commission report on public housing that state authorities need to separate tenancy and asset management functions. There has been a run-down in capital renewal of public housing in Australia&mdash;$31 billion of public housing assets&mdash;especially compared to the rate of private housing investment and renovation. This run-down has been a function of state authorities more concerned about their tenancy responsibilities than picking up asset management investments that have a long-term significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have relayed to the House previously the sort of public housing renewal programs I am supporting&mdash;and which I hope the government can sponsor&mdash;in the Campbelltown local government area of my electorate which take those large broad acre public housing estates that have not received a great deal of asset upgrading in recent years and give them the sort of treatment that has worked so successfully under the Better Cities Program at Elizabeth and under Defence Housing Authority programs at Holsworthy in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second initiative I support is the establishment of the affordability benchmark in housing. The 1992-93 housing budget statement announced that people on low incomes paying more than 20 per cent of their income on rent will be assisted by the Government towards meeting those costs. We have seen that through the rent assistance payment out of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, under the leadership of the Minister for Housing and Regional Development in this portfolio, is now developing a much more sophisticated benchmark such that no Australian should pay more than 30 per cent of income on rent, be they public or private renters. The minister is working with the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) to meet these targets of a rent assistance benchmark in Australia based on that fundamental social equity principle that Australians should pay no more than 30 per cent of their income on rent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance, of course, is that no distinction was made in that policy between public and private housing. The policy is ownership neutral. This approach&mdash;you would appreciate this, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;was endorsed by the 1994 ALP national conference establishing a social policy basis for benchmarking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are variations in the way in which this policy can be implemented. I will be interested to see later this evening what the budget papers show in relation to this matter. In New Zealand, for instance, rent assistance cuts in at 25 per cent of income. The government in New Zealand pays 65 per cent of the surplus and the tenant pays 35 per cent. The reason is that there needs to be a fear of perverse incentives in the housing market. If the government were to pay 100 per cent of the amount beyond the benchmark, there would be an incentive for tenants to locate themselves in high-cost suburbs, well beyond their income scope. We need to guard against perverse incentives. Personally, I think the New Zealand model&mdash;perhaps not as low as 65 per cent of government commitment&mdash;offers a lot of guidance in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the rent assistance affordability initiatives address a basic problem in the housing sector. This relates more broadly to social inequity in Australia. Australia's housing system and the appearance of a housing shortage is evidence enough of how subsidies are not always transferred to those most in need. In cities such as Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide there are nearly as many bedrooms as there are people. That is probably not the case in the Hunter Valley, but in Sydney it is definitely true that there are as many bedrooms as there are people. I will not speculate at this stage on the ratios in the Hunter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The housing crisis is actually a question of distribution and the way government subsidies have traditionally overlooked the needs of private rental households. The 1992 National Housing Strategy documented how private rental housing receives the smallest amount of government support per household, even though this sector is made up of the greatest number of households in poverty. The housing strategy found that, on the annual value of housing subsidies and tax concessions in Australia, home owners received $1,200 per household, home purchasers received about $1,300, public tenants received $1,800 and private tenants received just $300. The affordability initiatives likely to be presented in the budget tonight redress that imbalance. I support the bill. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this bill and the associated dairy produce levy No. 1 and No. 2 bills is to implement replacement domestic market support arrangements for the Australian dairy industry to operate from 1 July 1995. The passage of these bills will fulfil the government's commitment to the Australian dairy industry that it will deliver the same levels of support or as near as possible to that which would have been delivered under the 1992 dairy plan, had it continued, including the phased reductions of levels of support, to the year 2000.

The `market support payment' has been deemed an export subsidy under the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new World Trade Organisation agreement, Australia is obliged to reduce its export subsidies in terms of both the volume receiving the subsidy and the total amount paid in dollar terms. The existing mechanism does not allow for practical or acceptable reductions of volumes of exports receiving subsidies. Consequently, it has been necessary to change the policy to meet our World Trade Organisation membership commitments. This new plan will eliminate export subsidies completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of executive council conventions, we have already amended the 1992 dairy plan to terminate market support payments by 1 July 1995. This was achieved with the passage of the Dairy Produce (World Trade Organisation Amendments) Act 1994 last December. This bill provides for the implementation of a replacement mechanism of domestic support to producers of manufacturing milk, making it clearly a domestic support arrangement under the Uruguay Round commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In continuing the phase out of the previously agreed levels of legislated domestic support, the bill provides a secure framework for further dairy industry adjustment, investment and rationalisation. To date, the industry has responded positively to the process of deregulation and lowering levels of support. By any reckoning, the 1986 and 1992 schemes have been extremely successful in assisting with the improvement of the competitive capability of the Australian dairy industry. Government dairy policy has facilitated, and will continue to facilitate, adjustments at the farm level as well as improvement to the competitive operations of manufacturers and processing facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a strongly performing and competitive industry. It has recovered from the depressed years of the 1970s but it is now enjoying strong growth as one of our top performing rural industries. The industry is achieving improved economies of scale at the farming and manufacturing level. There is also a very important improvement in the level of research and innovation utilised. These factors taken together are producing an unprecedented level of industry efficiency, product diversification and a period of substantial investment in new plant and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is now very well positioned to continue to expand and to capture an increased share of the growing Asian markets. Exports of dairy products have set new records of about $1.3 billion in both 1992-93 and 1993-94. Under the new domestic support mechanism this process of restructuring and industry growth will continue, and it will place the industry in a very sound position by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new mechanism and arrangements covered by the bill have industry approval and I commend industry for joining, in close consultation with the government, in developing them. The main features of the new policy are as follows. The current levy imposed on market milk will continue and provide an intra-industry transfer from the market milk sector to manufacturing milk producers. It will be paid by producers but collected by manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An additional levy will be imposed on milk manufacturers on the milk used in the manufacture of dairy products other than market milk. This levy will be paid by manufacturers and will subsequently be either reimbursed by a rebate of the levy component of the export or passed on to domestic consumers through the pricing mechanism on the domestic market. In effect, the manufacturers, by passing on the levy component to consumers, will achieve the same level of consumer transfer&mdash;and no more&mdash;than would have resulted had the arrangements negotiated in 1992 been able to follow their course to the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imposition of the levies is addressed in the accompanying levy bills and the respective second reading speeches. All dairy levies will be changed to a milk fat and protein basis consistent with the basis for payment by manufacturers for milk received from producers. The consumer transfer is limited by the maximum levels specified under the 1992 plan which phases down to the year 2000. Our preliminary estimates, and these will most probably be revised, indicate that the level of consumer transfer and the intra-industry transfer together will total around $140 million for 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure the cost to manufacturers of running this new scheme is minimised, manufacturers will be able to offset their levy rebate entitlements for exports in any given month against the levy liability for that month. In the case of downstream manufacturers who do not pay levy, but who export dairy produce on which levy has been paid, a rebate will be paid by the Australian Dairy Corporation. These downstream manufacturers are responsible for about five to 10 per cent of exports. There are no resultant costs to other sectors of society as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that these rebates of the levy component in exports, whether offset against levy liability or paid direct, will not exceed the levy that would be imposed. In other words, as there is no net benefit to exporters, there is no export subsidy. The administration of import offsets will be improved by moving to a milk fat and protein basis consistent with the basis of levies and support payments. Receipts from the manufacturing and market milk levies over and above the amount needed to reimburse for export sales and administration costs will be paid directly to manufacturing milk producers by the Australian Dairy Corporation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned earlier, the level of support under the new mechanism will be unchanged from that which would have been provided under the 1992 dairy plan had it continued. The impact on domestic prices will be unchanged. The new policy will, in fact, be an improvement on the 1992 dairy plan as it will be clearly identifiable as a solely domestic support scheme and not an export subsidy which delivers a domestic support scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 30 June 1995 manufacturers will not be able to claim an export support payment on any of the 30 June 1995 stock on hand which might be exported.

As market support payments are not paid until produce is exported, manufacturers stand to be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To avoid any disruption to the market and allow manufacturers to recoup this prepayment, stocks on hand at 30 June 1995 will attract an export rebate at the manufacturers levy rate applicable when exported or the consumer transfer when sold on the domestic market. The export rebate on these stocks will create a debt to the domestic market support fund which will be financed by borrowings by the Australian Dairy Corporation and be repaid by producers of manufactured milk over the life of the scheme, through a reduction in support payments. The Australian Dairy Corporation will be charged with administering the market support fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manufacturers will be allowed an additional one-month grace in the deadline for payment of the manufacturing levy so as to offset the increased inventory cost associated with moving to the new scheme. These costs would otherwise have been incurred because manufacturers would have had to pay the levy well in advance of receiving the rebate of the levy on exports. For administrative reasons the lagging will have to apply to all the industry levies, including the market milk, corporation, research and development, and promotion levies. This will not mean a loss of one month's receipts from these levies, simply a delay in payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To wind up the scheme, the levy component within all stocks on hand as at 30 June 2000 will be paid out by the fund managed by the Australian Dairy Corporation.

I hope our people argued the case as effectively as they could have for a continuation of a scheme which was in the end not funded by taxpayers but funded by the industry and which was being phased out anyway. However, the agreement was found to be GATT illegal and the industry, to its great credit, indicated to the government that it would allow that agreement to be phased out ahead of the announcement of any replacement arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition agreed that it would support any package which gave the dairy industry the same advantages, which impacted in the same way on consumers and on manufacturers and which was GATT legal. In essence, we have a package before us now which matches what was known as the Crean plan. The all milk levy, which was the centrepiece of the Crean plan, is before us. We support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation that the dairy industry was operating under, which phases its assistance down to the equivalent of a five per cent tariff by the year 2000, was considered GATT illegal because it was seen as a subsidy to exports. As I have said, the industry, the government and the coalition agreed that this legislation should be removed. What needs to be said about the old arrangement is that it worked on a levy paid by dairy farmers on all milk. The money was pooled and then used to assist export returns; and it was on a sliding scale, whereby it was to be phased out by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This assistance to exports came, I suppose you could say, in the face of difficult circumstances confronting the industry in this country in years gone by. It was a progressive and very appropriate strategy, which encouraged an outward looking export oriented approach by the dairy industry, to which the industry has responded very positively. It built export performance. It acted as an incentive for dairy companies to continue to maintain and build that export performance and it provided mechanisms and incentives by which dairy farmers and the dairy industry were encouraged not to dump their product on the home market, thus having a deflating effect on the price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new legislation sets a levy on market milk&mdash;as opposed to all milk&mdash;which will amount to no more than the current all milk levy and which will based on protein and fat rather than just fat content.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new arrangement, instead of farmers paying a levy on the milk being used for manufacture, as they now do, there will be a levy on domestic manufactured products paid by manufacturers. These funds will be redistributed to farmers based on the amount of manufactured milk, as opposed to market milk, they have supplied. It means that the assistance will now be clearly identified as a domestic market support scheme rather than an export subsidy scheme. This makes it GATT legal and the effective phase down in the rate of assistance will continue at the same rate as the old legislation under the so-called Crean plan. </PARA>

It should also be noted that, because the levy is now to be levied on the basis of protein and fat, there may be some minor adjustments in the level of payments that individual farmers do receive. At this time, it is worth making the point that there is no great cause for concern in that. If it runs as well as it ought, those variations will be minor in the extreme. </PARA>

Without these provisions being put in place, anyone prepared to manipulate the system could have obtained an unfair financial advantage or gain by exporting dairy produce that had been imported or displaced from the domestic market by imports and then have claimed an export rebate without paying any manufacturing levy, which would, obviously, have been a distortion and would have allowed people to profit inappropriately. </PARA>

This is done on the GATT-legal principle that indirect taxation costs on production can be legally rebated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important principle for Australian agriculture. The government has refused absolutely even to sincerely acknowledge it exists, though a previous minister for primary industry in this place did once concede across the table that indirect costs to agriculture arising out of the government's wholesale sales tax mess are costing primary industry in this country a fortune.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a few words about the dairy industry. It is unquestionably one of Australia's great success stories. Only some 10 years or so ago the government was concerned that if the industry produced more than six billion litres of milk per year we would have a glut, the product would become unsaleable, prices would crash and we would have massive and widespread poverty and hardship not just among dairy farmers but across the communities in which they live. As a result of the very forward looking actions of the industry and its great push to value add product and to export value added product, this year there is likely to be a production well in excess of eight billion litres of milk. It will all be sold. Export income is expected to top $1.4 billion and, as a general principle, dairy farmers are doing very nicely. That is to be welcomed. The industry is to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These things do not come about by accident, of course. It ought to be noted that the industry has been at the forefront of quality assurance.

Australia has developed a worldwide reputation for dairy products of extremely high quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has taken us from, not so terribly many decades ago, having to deliver milk daily, because its keeping qualities are not particularly good, to a situation where today Australian dairy product has use-by dates that are the envy of the world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It virtually starts with the selection of the cow, where performance measurement has been in place for decades. What the cow eats is extremely important. Australian farmers are at the top end of the world's technology and production capability in terms of pasture management. It is also extremely important to pay strict attention to details such as the withholding of milk from cows treated with medications and the whole question of hygiene and refrigeration standards on the farm, in transport, in the factory and subsequently in the distribution chain. Farmers in this country have embraced a technology of bulk milk cell counts to ensure that they are not contaminating milk because they know that only the best milk should be put into cheese and other dairy products which are also produced at very high standards. </PARA>

Around 70 per cent of all milk produced in this country is handled by dairy farmer cooperatives. Unless things have changed, it is my understanding that Australia's dairy industry is the world's second most efficient. We are matched, or indeed outdone, only by the New Zealanders, and there are some very good reasons for the slight competitive advantage they add. Some of those reasons ought to be addressed by those opposite because they are not industry constraints so much as government imposed constraints.

Pat Rowley has led the industry through difficult times, including the lead-up to this legislation where dairy farmers were left in limbo in a situation where they had to trust the government&mdash;always a brave undertaking&mdash;to deliver on its verbal commitment, if you like, to replace the all milk levy with something that had the same positive effects for the industry and the Australian economy. </PARA>

Under the current arrangements, a producer levy on all milk is used to make support payments on exported dairy products, effectively raising the price received for exports. As a result, supplies are diverted away from the domestic market and the domestic price rises to be equivalent to the world price plus the export support payment. Thus support for the dairy industry is derived from higher domestic prices resulting in a transfer from Australian consumers to the dairy industry.

The projected increase in manufacturing milk returns reflects the optimistic outlook for the world dairy market. That optimism is shared by the industry and the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Market milk prices are projected to increase by around three per cent in real terms between 1994-95 and 1999-2000 and average around 49.3c a litre in 1999-2000. The forecast rise in market milk prices is based on the assumption that state dairy authorities continue to administer prices based on cost of production. Whilst all state dairy authorities will have deregulated post farm gate margins by 1999, there is as yet no provision for deregulating the price producers receive for market milk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian milk production is projected to rise by around 16 per cent over the medium term reaching 9 1/2 million litres by 1999-2000. Production increases, projected to be about three per cent each year, are likely to reflect increasing cow numbers, as well as improved pasture and livestock management techniques and increased capital investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outlook for the dairy industry is optimistic, but this will not be achieved without more of the ingredients I mentioned earlier. I do not know how resourceful dairy farmers are. I know quite a few of them up my way are. I think it is a general trait of dairy farmers that they strive for productivity, efficiency, good pastures and a good quality product. If that is the case, it will be a stronger and stronger industry in Australia. It will put more into the export markets than it does at present. The Asia-Japan area presents a large opportunity over the next five years, and I have no doubt that the dairy industry will take a large slice of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own area, the Norco Cooperative is a major employer on the north coast of New South Wales. It is one of the largest&mdash;if not the largest&mdash;single employer on the north coast of New South Wales. It is the second largest dairy cooperative in New South Wales. At present it sells mainly on the domestic market, but it is increasing its push into export markets. It markets Dairy Farmers milk, Norco butter and ice-cream, and Danone and Spring Grove cheese. It has been an integral part of Norco's life for many years. It is a part of the Australian dairy industry that is looking ahead. Over the past 10 years it has taken enormous steps forward. I am sure that over the next five years it will take further steps forward. This will be achieved if it maintains the ingredients I mentioned before: strong leadership in the industry; good dairy farmers; a good processing industry; and an ability, as industry leaders have shown, to cooperate, put strongly their views to government and get good outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main features of the amendments to the three bills include the annual assessment of the levy payable on milk fat and protein content of imports against export credits, either as a levy liability reduction or export rebate; the import offset levy up to the level of export credit of importers, which is covered by the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 2) Amendment Bill; the acquisition offset levy up to the level of export credit where imported product is acquired from an importer, which is covered by the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill; related companies being treated as a unit to prevent internal manipulation within the group by one company importing but not exporting and by another exporting but not importing, thereby avoiding levy; and the avoidance of double payment. These issues have also been discussed with the industry, which is satisfied with the approach reflected in the amending bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the coming years I look forward to a stronger and stronger dairy industry. It has an enormous potential. This type of legislation which has been formulated in cooperation with industry is certainly worthy of support. I appreciate the fact that the government and the opposition support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation is just in time for the commencement of the next dairy season. It is also just in time for the commencement of the Uruguay Round of the GATT which requires this legislation. I commend the government for delivering the legislation in time. I agree with the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia and shadow minister, the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), when he referred to the uncertainty that was created in the industry by the old legislation being terminated ahead of the new legislation. I know the dairy industry leaders trusted the government and that trust was repaid. I want to congratulate the leaders of the dairy industry. Reference has been made to Pat Rowley, and I support that. I would also include other people from the ADIC and the ADFF, such as Peter Gallagher and John McQueen, and John Watson from the UDV.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also congratulate the dairy farmers of Australia. They have shown, I think, more than members of any other industry in Australia&mdash;primary, secondary or service&mdash;a positive attitude to change and to difficulties confronting them in the export market. If one looks at the average age of dairy farmers, I think it is the best&mdash;that is, the youngest&mdash;average age of any form of farmer. They have a high capacity to accept new technology and management. That is why annual productivity increase at the dairy farm level in this industry consistently, over a number of years, has been higher than for any other industry in Australia, primary or secondary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also commend the Deputy Leader of the National Party for the very positive and bipartisan approach that he has continued to adopt to ensure that these dairy bills are progressed as quickly as possible. However, he did recognise, as have we on the coalition side for a number of years, that input costs are a very important determinant in the profitability of dairy farmers. That is why the dairy industry, to its credit, openly supported the GST proposal, which was fundamental to our policy in the last election&mdash;it would have reduced input costs. With the GST, the average cost per dairy farmer per year would have fallen by quite a few thousand dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is another factor to why input costs are important to dairy farmers&mdash;that is, the international dairy market is the most corrupt of any international trade. Agricultural trade is generally more corrupt; hence the importance of progress with the Uruguay Round of the GATT. For example, the average export subsidy on dairy product from the European Union or European Community is about twice the price the Australia dairy farmer receives. Compared with wheat, the trade in which is also corrupt, the export subsidy that the Americans or Europeans would give would be about half the export price of the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can see the greater degree of difficulty the dairy farmers of Australia have had to face; they have had to face it for a longer period of time than has any other agricultural exporter. As a result of that, the rationalisation has been greater and there has been a lot of pain. So in the dairy industry of Australia now we do have a very lean and efficient industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new mechanism that we are talking about in this legislation will overcome that technical GATT problem. It will not cover all milk; it will be just domestic milk. It will be levied on both protein and butterfat. In fact, there is quite a swing here. It is important because that is where the price is for dairy product now&mdash;with protein more than milk. It will be levied on 65 per cent protein to 35 per cent butterfat, whereas the old all milk levy was purely on butterfat. I understand the payment&mdash;or the repayment, if you like&mdash;will be shown separately on the dairy farmer's statement. That is important because it is what is called `transparency'&mdash;that is, dairy farmers are aware of that element. Because this level of support is declining, they are more aware of what the future may hold for them after the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that there will be a delay in the mechanism, a lag time in the levy being returned to those who are exporting. That will mean that there could be some confusion in the early days or weeks of the new scheme. But I am confident, and hope, that it will settle down and that dairy farmers will be able to budget quite confidently once they can see what is happening with the new system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Murray, the dairy industry is the largest primary and secondary&mdash;or, if you like, manufacturing&mdash;industry. After the electorate of Murray in northern Victoria has been enlarged for the next election to once again include the Cobram area, it will be easily the most significant dairy area of Australia with almost 30 per cent of total production&mdash;and I do acknowledge the other significant dairy areas of Australia, such as Gippsland and the Western District, and parts of New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 10 very large dairy factories in the electorate, including the two largest dairy companies in Australia, the two big cooperatives of Bonlac and Murray-Goulburn. Tatura is another cooperative. The two giant multinational diary companies, Kraft and Nestle, are basing their Australian production more and more on factories in the electorate. Then we have Yoplait and Snow Brand. Snow Brand is a very large Japanese dairy company, one of the largest dairy companies in the world. It has recognised that this part of Australia, the Murray electorate, the northern irrigation area of Victoria, is where much of the future expansion of the dairy industry will take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicated that, in general, the industry in Australia has had amazing productivity. In my electorate, the growth in productivity is about 10 per cent per year. Exports of dairy products from the Murray electorate are about $700 million per year or about half the total dairy exports from Australia. By the year 2000, I believe the electorate will produce more than a billion dollars worth of exports, unless something unforeseen happens. I calculate that in Victoria, which is the major dairy state in Australia, dairy exports this year will be about $1.2 billion. The dairy industry is the largest manufacturing export industry in Victoria, but it is generally not recognised because the media and other people usually concentrate on the industry involving the manufacture of non-farm processed goods. The dairy industry is our most significant manufacturing export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some restrictions on the future growth of this industry. The first restriction is the capital requirement. This is a particular problem with cooperatives. Naturally, farmer members want to retain control, but there is a limit on the profits that can be retained by the factory for expansion, because the farmers themselves are engaged in a high degree of capital expansion and refinement on their own farms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second restriction is that these days capital is not just needed for the initial processing. It is also needed for the second round, if you like, which is value adding. There is increasingly a third element of capital required for the environment, that is, water quality. There are World Health Organisation standards on the water quality into the factories and increasing restrictions&mdash;and I do not knock this&mdash;on effluent from the factories, which means additional costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As many people would recognise, my electorate has a problem with salinity because of irrigation. I do not think salinity is an immediate problem to the future expansion of the dairy industry as is the ability to handle the increasing effluent in an environmentally acceptable way. At the moment, the calculation is that about $100 million needs to be spent by the local water authorities in the area to bring the quality of water into the factory and the effluent control out of the factory to international standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third restriction on the future growth of this industry could be government policies, a very important element. There needs to be cost restraints so that there is a profit for those who are involved in this very demanding industry. A part of this involves infrastructure efficiency, otherwise known as micro-economic reform or, as it is now known, Hilmer reform. Again, I think of water but, in particular, of electricity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest problems facing dairy factories in my electorate&mdash;therefore, this is an important element of total dairy production in Australia&mdash;is the lack of electricity capacity. This results in an unstable supply and power surges, which creates a loss of millions and millions of dollars a year. Both the efficient distribution of electricity and its cost&mdash;electricity is one of the major costs confronting dairy farmers and factories&mdash;will be very significant to the profitability of dairying in the future. Another infrastructure element is transport. Our containers should be 40 tonnes rather than 20 tonnes as they are at the moment. There needs to be a dramatic improvement in the efficiency of the port of Melbourne, from which most of our product is exported. It is unfortunate that, after some initial improvement, the port of Melbourne appears to be slipping again into a high cost port. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dairy farmers are experiencing some short-term difficulties. At the moment they are facing a significant profit squeeze. This is obvious in the drought areas because of the reduced pasture and the very high price of grain and hay. In the irrigation areas, there are water restrictions. In spite of comments about firming international prices, the price the dairy farmer has been receiving so far has not been nearly as good as many people think. The world price is firming. Russia is back in the dairy market as a commercial buyer. The Europeans are reducing the export subsidies, and the higher currency level of the European countries is adding to that as well. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The production of programming material using new forms of communications technology is something that has tremendous potential to create a lot of jobs and export earnings for Australia for many years to come. One way to demonstrate the importance of this new technology is the simple fact that Warner Bros, one of the major players in this industry, is expecting to produce over 25,000 CD-ROM titles in the next five years. It is vital that we have the Australian content creation industry working to make sure it is staking a part in this important industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in the honourable member's electorate, particularly in Ipswich, there is a great deal of interest in information superhighways and the opportunities that can create for people in rural and provincial Australia, in cities such as Ipswich. But the government believes that one way we can seek to ensure that we build up partnerships in this industry is to have the government playing a very active role. In Creative Nation we announced that we would be putting up $84 million to encourage private sector investment and partnerships between the government and the private sector in multimedia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give people some example of what this means, I am sure many honourable members or their children at least are aware of a CD-ROM which is out at the moment called Encarta, produced by Microsoft. It provides a little bit of information about Australia's Aborigines and Aboriginal culture. It is only when you turn to the CD-ROM which has been produced by the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies that you get a much more detailed picture of Aboriginal culture. Not only can you get the text, the diagrams and the photographs that are in the book form of the Aboriginal encyclopedia, but you can get photographs, the audio tracks of oral histories and you can even get some quite rare archival footage which is also restored on the CD-ROM. The way that Australian culture can be presented using new forms of communications technology is really quite interesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing is that in using these new forms of technology we are making sure that Australians and Australian kids in particular are not deluged with foreign content, are not deluged with content which is produced in North America in particular. We have to understand that kids will absorb the values in the American content as quickly as they will absorb the spelling in the American content. So that is one reason why the government has put $84 million into stimulating the industry; $45 million into a new joint venture capital company called Australian Multimedia Enterprise, which had its first meeting a week ago yesterday; and money into Australia on CD to make sure that quality Australian content such as this is available around the country. I am pleased that the government has already received 159 different proposals for ways that we can develop new Australian content that can be presented on CDs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to contrast the government's efforts to develop partnerships with the private sector in developing this new content industry with the view of the opposition. The official spokesman for the opposition on communications has said that this is money down the drain&mdash;it is money down the drain to let kids learn about Aboriginal culture on CD-ROMs; it is money down the drain to have Australian industry being at the leading edge of the development of this new content creation industry&mdash;in the same way that you would say it is money down the drain to put anything into our cultural industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contrast is that we believe the most important decision that we have made to encourage the content creators in Australia is our decision and determination to make sure there is open access on the cable&mdash;a decision we took last November, despite condemnation from the opposition which believed we were wrong to insist on open content on the cable. That is the decision that is going to make sure the Australian content creators can get to their customers out there around Australia by providing this material that might today be on CD-ROM but one day will come down that cable into your home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why it was so important that we have open access on that cable. That is why it is so hard to understand that the opposition preached support for Hilmer but was against open access on the cable last year. For these and other reasons, we will make sure that this industry continues to thrive with the stimulation the government is giving it. We want to develop these partnerships between government and industry to produce quality content such as this.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The strength of Australia's copyright laws has for a long time been recognised internationally, but there have been some areas of difficulty. Last week it was very pleasing to learn that the United States government has dropped Australia off a watch list of countries which it had deemed to have inadequate intellectual property laws. The list of offending countries appeared under a special section 301 of the United States trade act. Keeping Australia company on that list were countries such as Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, China, the Philippines and Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had long argued that the listing of Australia under section 301 was unjustified. That argument was made through diplomatic and trade channels but, until now, with no success. I understand that the dropping of Australia from the list was due to the continuing efforts made by our embassy in Washington and our continuing domestic copyright reforms. I am very happy to say that at long last the message has got through to the United States that Australia's intellectual property environment is world class and that its laws will continue to be so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States decision to drop Australia from that watch list was taken independently of Australia's decision on parallel importation of sound recordings, but that decision will certainly reduce the likelihood that Australia will be put back on the watch list. There has been some criticism of our decision on parallel importation. That decision was borne of our determination to make Australian industry world competitive whilst maintaining strong copyright protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons that the government could not stand by its 1992 decision on parallel importation of sound recordings was that it was inconsistent with our international obligations under GATT. The government's recent decision on this issue is consistent with our international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The critics should also recognise that Australia is not on its own in restricting parallel importation. Quite to the contrary: we could not find a single country that allowed parallel importation, enjoyed low music prices, had an internationally competitive music industry and had low levels of piracy. In fact, we found that 10 countries in the last two years have introduced restrictions on parallel importations of sound recordings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with the comments that my colleague the Minister for Communications and the Arts has made today about the importance of us growing a strong domestic content industry. We have a competitive advantage in our intellectual property area. It is an area we will continue to support to grow and to advance the interests of all Australians. I reject entirely the contemptuous attitude of the opposition towards that sector of intellectual growth and endeavour in the arts, which is obviously manifested by the contempt it has shown in relation to these issues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. On 17 August 1992 I wrote to the former Treasury secretary, Mr Cole, seeking his assurance that the economic forecasts in the 1992 budget had not been subject to political interference. The then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, replied that all economic forecasts in the budget would be prepared on `as realistic a basis as possible'. Yet Mr Dawkins subsequently confessed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 9 February 1995 that forecasts in his 1993 budget deliberately understated revenue forecasts. In light of this admitted deceit, why should anyone believe the figures in tonight's budget?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member well knows&mdash;or he probably does not know&mdash;the forecasts which are produced in each budget are a product of discussion amongst government departments, and they are based on the best advice that is available at the time. The fact of the matter is that, if you actually look at the forecasts we made in the last budget&mdash;there is no particular magic about these figures: forecasts sometimes come through; sometimes they do not&mdash;you will see that we underestimated growth in GDP, we underestimated the improvement in employment, we overestimated the inflation rate and we underestimated the growth in business investment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members will recall that in May 1993 the government decided to settle something like 100 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> claims which were on foot at that time. That particular settlement scheme proceeded without an admission of liability on the part of the Commonwealth, but proceeded on the assumption that the Commonwealth was liable, and on a fair assessment of the loss&mdash;physical, emotional or mental&mdash;suffered by the particular survivors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme decided by the government in 1993 was limited to claims that had been commenced against the Commonwealth prior to the enactment of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act in 1988. That legislation replaced common law actions against the Commonwealth and replaced them with the compensation scheme which we now know as Comcare. It was thought at that time that that scheme would be sufficient to handle any further <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As events have unturned, something like another 100 claims have been made since that cabinet decision. There has also been some judicial decisions on particular provisions of the Comcare legislation. In light of those decisions, though a number of legal issues are still outstanding, it was considered by the cabinet on 24 April that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> cases were not ones which should be used as test cases, as it were, for the settling of these issues, and the government agreed that all future claims regarding the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> would be settled in a scheme similar to that which applied in May 1993.</PARA>

I should note that, of all the claims which were on foot at the time of the previous scheme, all were successfully negotiated and settled.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Page for his question and his continued interest in the Australian resources sector. As the House would be aware, the resources sector accounts for 62 per cent of Australia's commodity exports and some 36 per cent of our total exports. The forecasts are, indeed, good because of the upturn in the world economic situation. In fact, mineral commodity resource exports will be some $30.8 billion for 1994-95 and will rise to $34.2 billion in 1995-96.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of good stories in this, particularly in the aluminium-alumina sector where the rise this year will be 11 per cent and 14 per cent in 1995-96, to some $5.2 billion. Gold, while experiencing a fall this year of five per cent, will rise by 7.4 per cent in 1995-96, to bring in $5.4 billion. Iron ore, which has had a difficult time in recent years, will fall by six per cent this year but will grow by 8.6 per cent in 1995-96, to $2.83 billion. Even better news for our base metals is that the rises in base metal prices will be some 29 per cent this year and up to a further 21 per cent in 1995-96, giving us $3.86 billion worth of exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Page referred in his question to the outcome on coal prices. Since this parliament last met, coal prices have been settled with Japan, which remains our largest market. The price rises were quite significant. For the first time this year, our coal exports will exceed $8 billion&mdash;by far our largest single export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Australian negotiators took a very hard line and achieved notable price rises, they were, in some ways, punished for their persistence. Earlier settlements made by other countries meant that only some tonnages were left for Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question. As honourable members would know, for quite some time&mdash;in fact for several decades&mdash;the Department of Defence, through DSTO, has conducted research into defence against chemical weapons. In this regard our support of the United Nations' position against aspects of chemical warfare in the Middle East and our contribution toward putting together the chemical warfare convention are well known. In that context, Defence has reviewed the case for research into defence against biological warfare and the government has endorsed a modest program to do exactly that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three basic reasons for doing this. First of all, advances in biological sciences and biotechnology have somewhat blurred what was already a confused relationship between chemical and biological agents. There is very clearly a need for our scientists to investigate the implications of these rapid advances for our national security. Secondly, it is possible that the government, as it does from time to time, would deploy ADF personnel in support of UN operations&mdash;for example, to areas where there may be risk of exposure to biological weapons. Thirdly, of course, such research contributes directly to our ability to help in arms control verification, a measure that is not of inconsequence for our credibility in a range of fields. In that context it also serves to facilitate access by us to related defensive research which is conducted by our allies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. This is a clear safety issue involving the government's responsibility for the safety of children and industry concern. It is about exercise bikes. On 19 October last year, I declared a new mandatory product safety standard in relation to exercise bikes supplied in Australia. Businesses that supply these cycles, including people who hire them out, have until 1 June this year to comply with the new legal requirements which essentially involve the guarding of hazardous moving parts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standard applies only to the supply of these exercise cycles. Therefore, there will still be a lot of exercise cycles in gyms and homes that will not comply with the standard. They are extremely dangerous to children. The mandatory standard was developed following research which showed that children were being seriously injured. Between 1986 and 1992, more than 300 accidents involving children were reported to the national injury surveillance unit, and often they involved amputation&mdash;that is, children losing their fingers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lots of businesses, particularly some that hire out these machines, have complained that they have to have the new cycles ready, they have to comply, by 1 June this year. They want more time to meet the proposed mandatory standard. They will not get more time. Industry has been aware of the problems associated with this product since September 1991. Three doctors published an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> describing the injuries they have treated. Industry has been involved since that time in getting the mandatory standard ready. It takes years to get a mandatory standard ready.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a mandatory standard, which was declared on 19 October. I realise that it may be difficult, but they will get the correct cycles ready by this time. In any event, it is the responsibility of government to put the safety of the children first. I am not prepared to allow the possibility of one child's finger being lost due to the delay in the implementation of this standard.</PARA>

Surely, it cannot be argued that a generalised attack in advance on anybody who might be appointed to head a royal commission can in any way be excluded from the ambit of either a question or an answer by reason of a subsequent establishment of a royal commission and the nomination of an individual.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Hunter for his question. Yes, I am aware of press reports today, in particular, regarding research being conducted by Dr John Ward into the levels of stress in a sample of Australian soldiers 15 months after their return from a UN peacekeeping mission in Somalia. The research was approved by the Australian Defence Medical Ethics Committee and it is, I should inform honourable members, the first controlled study into the psychological effects of UN peacekeeping on our troops.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say at the outset that the Australian Defence Force is very much concerned with not only the physical effects of overseas deployments but also the psychological effects. I fear that this will become increasingly more so if this age of barbarism, which seems to have taken hold in certain parts of the planet, continues with our troops in particular having to be deployed on behalf of the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that appropriate policy was in place, at the time of the Somalian mission, to cover the management of psychological stress, and all personnel were given appropriate psychological briefings before leaving Australia. The army has teams of trained professionals, such as psychologists and chaplains, who can be deployed in response to specific incidents which we must, I suppose, describe as being outside the norm which our people would normally confront and outside the range of ordinary human experience&mdash;which we must all, I think, acknowledge was the case recently with the massacres in the Rwandan refugee camps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Somalia, all personnel were sent a psychological questionnaire six to 12 weeks after return. More than half of those people responded and, of those responding, about one in 20 indicated that they would seek further counselling. Of course, for the Australian Defence Force personnel deployed in Rwanda, the army has in place an ongoing program of both pre- and post-deployment briefing. All personnel were briefed before proceeding to Rwanda. Two weeks prior to the scheduled group return, teams of army psychologists will travel or are travelling to Rwanda to conduct stress debriefing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further follow-up of personnel on return to Australia is in place, with additional psychological debriefing, counselling and other assistance being provided as required. In addition, partners, families and friends of such service personnel are also offered psychological counselling, focusing on the difficulties associated with reunion with the troops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the most recent massacres in those refugee camps&mdash;which I am sure horrified all members in this place&mdash;and their particular propensity for psychological trauma, a team of three army psychologists recently were deployed to Rwanda for a two-week period to provide on-site psychological support. The service personnel involved will receive follow-up support on their return to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I think we have to be realistic about this issue. We will never be able to completely overcome the effects of service in places such as Somalia and Rwanda where the most vivid horrors of mankind manifest themselves in front of the eyes of our troops. However, I can say that the ADF now has a clearer understanding of the problem and, more importantly, a much clearer determination to deal with it and to firmly entrench that determination within the ADF for years to come.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, my question is in two parts and arises out of your remarks. Firstly, with respect to the latter part of your remarks concerning what I was supposed to have said on television, I would have to say to you that I have couched my words carefully and, I believe, within the standing orders. If you believe otherwise, which you have today implied, then you ought do me the courtesy of saying so rather than suggesting that you have exercised your discretion in my favour. My question is: if you genuinely believe that, would you put that to us so that we know what your views are?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in response to your very vague answer to the question put to you earlier by the Leader of the National Party, I ask you to be specific. When you were referring to `all members', were you thereby attempting to specifically refer to the Prime Minister? Can we therefore take it that, rather than the soft answer that you gave, in fact you are now prepared to publicly repudiate what the Prime Minister had to say about you?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I compliment you on the decision you have made to nominate this as a matter of public importance because we on this side of the parliament, we in the coalition, believe it is a matter of very considerable public importance as we have the budget being handed down tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose our basic proposition is that one of the most shabby, one of the most shameful and one of the lowest acts of this government in the whole time it has been in office since March 1983 has been its manipulation of data in respect of the circumstances facing the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst that first blush may seem remote from the affairs of most Australian families, it is in fact a matter of very great relevance. The reason it is a matter of very great relevance is simple&mdash;in the management of the Australian economy it is very important that we have a fair and realistic assessment from the government and the government's principal economic advisers about the state of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason it is important for families and Australian voters to have before them that balanced and fair appreciation of where the economy is at is that without that basic information it is very hard for the public to judge whether or not the government is making the right economic decisions at any particular time. So if people have little idea of the circumstances facing us, they are thereby denied the opportunity to participate in the democratic process, to have a say about the management of government in the period between elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government spends a lot of money through the Australian Bureau of Statistics to ensure that we have a reasonable flow of reliable information about aspects of the economy, but it is the putting together of that information and the informed assessments and judgments which come out in the budget statements and economic statements from time to time which are critical in giving the Australian public a fair idea of where we are at and where we ought to be going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without a shadow of a doubt the truth is, as I want to show today quite conclusively, that this government year in and year out has deliberately set out to manipulate the economic data presented to the Australian public. It has become the master of this process of manipulation. Going right back to when this government was first formed in 1983, in the very early months it set up a process to fix the system so that it could fix the figures being put to the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact in 1984, in the early years of this government, it disbanded what was then known as the National Income Forecasting Committee and established instead the Joint Economic Forecasting Group, which was the key instrument within the bureaucracy to provide economic assessments to government. The government scrapped the system which had worked very efficiently for many years and put in a new system so that it could stack the new economic forecasting group with its own people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the principal participants in that group was Don Russell, who for many years was Paul Keating's principal economic adviser. He was basically the Treasurer when the Treasurer was away and he exercised a lot of influence, of course at the direction of Mr Keating, so that the data that went to the Treasurer's office and the Prime Minister's office was fixed before it even got there. This has given us a series of examples of fixing the books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me start with three examples that have been established, substantiated and independently documented. I want to give you three case studies of three budgets. In 1988, the government insisted on increasing the projected investment levels. It told those responsible for preparing these figures to put in a 12 per cent investment forecast. The Treasury was so put out about this that it put 12 per cent against each of the three elements of the investment figures. That would be a very odd forecast to have, so it was sent back to Treasury and the government said, `We want you to cover our tracks. We want you to gloss over the fingerprints.' The figures came out at 12, 12 1/2 and 11 1/2 per cent for the three different categories. These guys were experts even back in 1988 on fixing the numbers. That was the year in which the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, announced:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nation is successfully emerging from its most severe economic crisis in a generation . . . this is the one that brings home the bacon. Our foreign debt burden has already stabilised and begun to fall.</PARA>
<PARA>Over the following year, net foreign debt rose by 22 per cent and within two years we had entered the worst recession in 60 years. So 1988 was the year of `bring home the bacon' and the fiddled investment figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1989 year the fiddle was focused on the debt issue. The current account deficit figure that was recommended was $21 billion. That was too high, so these guys supplanted a new figure of $18.5 billion. You might remember the 1989 budget was the one about which Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the government's economic policies, Australia will emerge from the recent high level of spending without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the `we're going to have a soft landing' budget. Does that sound familiar? That is the sort of line we are getting this year. Of course, within a year we were actually into the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In 1988 they fiddled the investment figures and in 1989 they fiddled the current account figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 were they pure? Oh, no, for heaven's sake, these guys are into a pattern; they do it every year. In August 1990, the growth forecasts in the budget were boosted to two per cent, which is quite an incredible figure when you think about it. Two per cent was the forecast for 1990-91, but that was the year we actually entered the recession&mdash;when employment fell and the recession was on us. In that year, not only did Mr Keating boost the growth forecasts&mdash;which was a quite deliberate and manipulative lie and a fraud on the Australian public&mdash;but also he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This year inflation will fall further, the current account deficit will markedly improve and employment will pick up . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession.</PARA>
<PARA>We got exactly the opposite of what these guys said. So we have those three case studies that are absolutely crystal clear, black and white, and independently substantiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the end of it. This is very interesting. If you go back to some of the debates in 1992, we presented some of this information to Mr Keating and he actually admitted it. He actually said in the parliament&mdash;so it is not just an independent analyst saying this&mdash;on 24 June:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the claims by some of the pointy people is that I rewrote parts of Statement No. 2. Too right I have.</PARA>
<PARA>He is a classic. When he is in a defensive position, he attacks. We say, `Paul, you've done a dreadful thing. You've been fiddling the books.' So he gets up and says, `Too right I have. Of course I have been fiddling the books. It's my job to fiddle the books.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go on to show you what a shallow operator this guy is, let me just explain that statement No. 2 is the document prepared by the Treasury. The government goes around saying that the important thing about this document is that it is prepared by the professionals. Back in 1982, when Mr Keating was in opposition, he said this about statement No. 2:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I ask the parliament: Where do we go in this nation when the principal Minister of government, responsible for the Department of the Treasury and responsible for the publication of the only document upon which the Australian nation can base some economic judgment, falsifies that document?</PARA>
<PARA>`Where can we go when they falsify that document?', asked Mr Keating in 1982. Good question, Mr Keating; it is still the same question for you in 1995. They are three case studies, and a confession out of the Prime Minister's own mouth of the fiddling of the books that has gone on in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention two other classic case studies where those opposite have fiddled the books, and where we have got it very clear. The first one is, in a sense, the worst: this was the One Nation statement which you might remember was brought down in February 1992. The opposition had brought down its economic package for the following election at the end of 1991. It was an interesting document: it saw the end of Mr Hawke&mdash;in fact, he said that he had been knocked over as a result of the opposition's statement; it saw the then Treasurer, the long forgotten `watch this space' Mr Kerin, get knocked off as a result; and it saw Mr Keating elevated to the prime ministership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating had one political objective, and that was to respond to the coalition's economic policy manifesto. He was basically going to do anything that he possibly could&mdash;and could get away with&mdash;in that response. It was also a particularly challenging time for Keating because the opposition had put up a package which included tax reform, privatisation and labour market reform&mdash;many of the economic reform things that he himself had wanted to do in the past but had never had the political clout to be able to deliver. So it was for him, as the incoming Prime Minister, not only an economic challenge but really an intellectual challenge, overlaid with the political imperative of defeating the opposition, then ahead in the polls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those circumstances&mdash;and it tells you a lot about the Prime Minister&mdash;instead of attempting to match the coalition's proposition in a substantial way, what did he do? He reached for the grand lie. The great manipulator put at the centre of his document what we now know he knew at the time to be a lie. It was revealed just last night on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>, not by anybody on our side but by the head of Treasury at the time&mdash;if you did not see it, you should&mdash;that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a committee that included Treasury representatives on it and our representatives struggled to try to make sure that those projections and our representatives struggled to try to make sure that those projections retained credibility but in the final analysis they strained credibility so, you know . . . well, they were predominantly influenced by people in the Prime Minister's office.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, against the advice, knowing that it was wrong, he set out at the centre of the One Nation package a deliberate lie. It was not just to swindle us. I suppose the public would reckon it is one thing for the politicians to get into each other but it is a very different thing to set out deliberately to mislead the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the government's line was: you can have all these wonderful benefits, but there is no pain. That was the basic line, and the principal benefit was a whopping, great big tax cut, which we now know&mdash;and tonight it is going to prove&mdash;will never and can never be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have three case studies independently documented; a statement of admission&mdash;a confession, if you like&mdash;by the Prime Minister; and a fourth case study, which the then Treasury secretary told you of in black and white for all to see on television last night. There is a fifth case study. We were so browned off at these guys lying and cheating that in August 1992 I wrote to Mr Cole and I said, `For the 1992 budget can we have an assurance that these guys have not fiddled the books again.' Mr Cole did not write back to me. Mr Dawkins, the then Treasurer, wrote back and basically gave me the assurance, `In future it will be all okay.'</PARA>

After he promised black and blue that he would not do it again, in the next budget he fiddled the revenue forecasts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite basically do it every year: 1988, 1989, 1990, 1992&mdash;the One Nation Statement&mdash;and 1993.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not hard to tell when the opposition is running on empty, it is not hard to tell when the fuel arrow has hit empty: it recycles the member for Flinders on an economic debate&mdash;the father of Fightback trying to lecture the government about forecasts. When the Australian people listen to the budget figures this evening, there is one thing they should do: they should remember One Nation and its forecasts for their dazzling accuracy. Obviously the member for Flinders, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) and other members on the opposition side have done no more research than to ignore the pattern of economic growth in Australia over the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the figures in One Nation. For 1991-92 One Nation forecast a growth rate of zero per cent. The outcome was 0.7 per cent. In 1992-93 the forecast in One Nation was 4.75 per cent. The outcome was three per cent. In 1993-94 the forecast in One Nation for growth was 4 1/2 per cent. The outcome: four per cent. In 1994-95, the financial year about to be concluded, the forecast in One Nation was 4 1/4 per cent. The outcome: 5.5 per cent. These are incredibly accurate forecasts. These are forecasts which, in the history of economics and the history of government policy making, stand up as an outstanding performance. All punters in Australia would want that sort of forecasting capacity when they go to the racetrack. All investors in Australia would want that sort of forecasting capacity when they go to the stock market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason why the majority of voters in Australia keep on supporting this government, which under the One Nation forecast&mdash;the initial document of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;has produced economic projections that by and large have been the subject of outstanding results. The figures from the forecasts are not far from the outcome. They demonstrate why the Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister: because he got it right in One Nation. It also demonstrates why <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> is declining in the ratings. It demonstrates why Laura Tingle is just a journalist. It demonstrates why Tony Cole is now just a commentator. It also demonstrates, most significantly of all, why the coalition is still in opposition and is likely to remain there for a long time to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the member for Flinders, who thinks this is of such public importance that he has now left the chamber, thinks that is a lie, let us have more of it. Let us have in tonight's budget forecast the sort of accuracy that this government has produced over the last five years. This sort of accuracy&mdash;I am sure honourable members honestly would agree&mdash;is an outstanding performance from One Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the coalition is picking a fight on growth forecasts is sounding a little like Richie Richardson when he says after losing a cricket match, `They are a weaker team but they keep on beating us.' The truth is that we are going to keep on beating the opposition because we are the stronger team. If those opposite want to have a debate about economic forecasts, let us stack up the coalition record against the government's record. Let us stack up the record of the Hewson-Reith team in the last election campaign. It predicted a depression in Australia on the scale of the 1930s. The Reith-Hewson team in March 1993 predicted a double dip recession. This is the same member for Flinders reported by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program in August 1991 as saying that he had released economic models and that his results showed a short-term rise in unemployment between 42,000 and 45,000 people. Unemployment has been falling ever since the member for Flinders made the prediction that unemployment would go up substantially. The same member for Flinders said when interviewed by Laurie Oakes in August 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that's on top of an up to 100,000 people who are losing their jobs in the next two or three years as a result of the superannuation levy.</PARA>
<PARA>He predicted that the superannuation levy would result in 100,000 Australians losing their jobs. The truth is that since the last election 560,000 Australians have gained jobs&mdash;560,000 people in this country who had been unemployed have now found a meaningful place in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same member for Flinders who made these predictions and who has been wrong time after time. I think his leader, the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), has perhaps listened too closely to the member for Flinders. Maybe it inspired him to come out with his statement `five minutes of economic sunshine'. We know the Leader of the Opposition is yesterday's man. I can only suggest his sundial or his 1950-style Seiko watch has well and truly broken down. We have not had five minutes of sunshine; we have had the longest growth cycle in Australia's history. The economy has been growing since June 1991. We have had 45 successive months of economic growth. During that period we have had the confirmation of every one of the forecasts made in One Nation four years ago. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> the shadow Treasurer pretty well surrendered on budget policy. On the opposition's side, he pretty well surrendered on fiscal policy. He said that the opposition would shift the weight of its economic attack against the government away from the need for further big budget cuts and towards micro-economic reform. So, after 12 months of rhetoric, 12 months of all tip and no iceberg and 12 months of big talk about what he would do about the deficit, he put up the white flag on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would the shadow Treasurer not surrender when he has shadow ministry colleagues like the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) promising under a coalition government a universal age pension costing $3 billion? Why would he not surrender on fiscal discipline when the opposition has a policy to remove tax from the interest earnings on savings, costing the budget $3 billion? Why would he not surrender when the opposition's health spokespeople have been talking about tax concessions for private health insurance to the value of $1 billion? Why would he not surrender when his own leader, the member for Bennelong, is fulfilling his long commitment to income splitting at a fiscal cost of $3 billion? From the backbench&mdash;forget about the frontbench&mdash;the other half of the Abbott and Costello team, the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), proposes a non-means tested family payment of $6 billion. If you add up all of those figures, they come to an astonishing fiscal blow-out by the coalition of $16 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No wonder he has given up. He is going to sit back tonight and watch this government reduce the deficit.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the record of his own leader, the member for Bennelong, as an economic forecaster, maybe he should do that. I can assure the House that he is not going to challenge Nostradamus on his public record. In 1983, after the last Howard budget, the Secretary to the Treasury wrote this in a minute to the new government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The magnitude of the fiscal imbalance is unprecedented in Australia during peace time . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This is what he said in the official minute to the incoming government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget balance is projected to deteriorate from near zero to more than 6 per cent of GDP in a two-year period. The speed and magnitude of that deterioration is almost without precedent among the major OECD countries in the post-war period.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) pointed out in the House during question time, this was due to the breakdown in the relationship between Treasury and the former Treasurer and Treasury and the former Prime Minister, an absolute breakdown that attempted to conceal from the Australian public and the media during an important election campaign the extent of the fiscal blow-out. Those opposite talk about broken promises and about twisting the truth, but there has been no greater deception or twisting of the truth than the actions of the member for Bennelong during his last budget and the deceitful cover up that followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not all. He was building on his 1977 election campaign record&mdash;the fistful of dollars, a promise made only to be broken, a promise withdrawn as soon as the election was completed. As soon as the last vote went in the ballot box the fistful of dollars was taken back from the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And that is not all. What happened on tax policy 10 years later, in the 1987 election? The member for Bennelong was in his first term as Leader of the Opposition. A $7.3 billion tax bribe to the Australian electorate was exposed for a double counting error of $1.6 billion. Even the member for Bennelong had to admit that there was a big error of the order of $540 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite cannot get it right in opposition, they have absolutely no hope of getting it right in government. All they want to do, of course, is go back to failed promises from a failed era with failed, recycled former leaders&mdash;back to the GST, putting it into the back pocket and the bottom drawer. The member for Bennelong knows he is supporting the GST and he knows that a coalition government, if ever elected, would implement it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of One Nation Tony Cole may well have been uncomfortable about those forecasts. He may have conveyed that feeling to the Treasurer of the day. But, on the public record and the economic results since then, there is absolutely no question that Tony Cole was wrong, that his feelings were misplaced and that the government was right&mdash;absolutely 100 per cent right. If the opposition's next speaker, the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), has the decency to convey to the House the figures on economic performance against the forecasts in One Nation, he will recognise that they are closely correlated. They are locked together as an outstanding result. The member for Mayo (Mr Downer), in his usual style, was chortling away at question time, saying in response to the Minister for Finance, `That's not correct.' He should go away and do the sort of research he never did when he had a chance as leader. He should look up the basic facts on growth performance and the One Nation forecasts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to recognise another strength of the One Nation forecasts. The unemployment rate forecast for 1994-95 was 8 1/4 per cent. That was almost spot on. The inflation forecast was 3 1/2 per cent. That was a bit too high but close enough to be regarded as an outstanding result. The forecast on the deficit was that the budget would be back into balance by 1995-96. If we do not see that tonight, then it will be only a couple of billion dollars out. A forecast made four years ago may only be out by 0.3 per cent of GDP on a $460 billion economy. What a great result. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Those two things are going to impact on the final budget outlay but how can we in May predict what the climate and the impact will be on farm products and, therefore, our capacity to export farm commodities?

We hope that we are going to make this amount of money from entry at the sports games and so on.' We make forecasts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article states that the increase in the international price of milk by the year 2000 has now been revised downwards from 12.1 per cent to only 1.2 per cent. It also indicates as a final point that, in addition to all those things that these countries are doing, there is another clause which allows countries to re-impose protection if imports rise modestly above a certain amount, even without having to prove injury to domestic farmers. The point is that there are still plenty of problems with regard to fair trade for dairy products internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are others as well. I refer to the United States and its use of the DEIP, its dairy export improvement program. Although it has to phase down the amount, there is no restriction on the markets it can enter. It can actually target what have tended to be more Australian markets in the past. Also, the US Farm Bill is still being proposed in the United States. The Americans have been very clever in the past in finding their way around international agreements and providing new forms of assistance to their own inefficient dairy farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European Union has not been able to impose the adequate quota reductions in its production which it had been hoping for over the last few years. But now that the problem with Italy and its quotas has at last been sorted out, or presumably sorted out, hopefully some progress can be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Asia is a great success story for Australia. When we talk about a percentage of Australian exports into Asia, I think wool and dairy products are the only two Australian products which have actually increased in terms of their percentage of the total market and which are the dominant imports of those commodities into Asia. Although our general level of exports to these Asian countries is generally increasing, our percentage of the market has actually been declining. Once again that is a great achievement for the dairy industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are still very severe restrictions on access of Australian dairy products to Asia.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is a need for a second round of the GATT as soon as possible and also for an open APEC arrangement. A potential problem with ASEAN being an internal arrangement is that it could actually restrict the benefits to Australian dairy products and also the degree of value adding for dairy products and other products that we can process in Australia compared with what we should be allowed to sell to other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One final point that the industry has to face in the future is BST, or bovine somatotropin. It is a natural hormone which increases milk production. So far it has not been allowed to be used in Australia. The United States is the only country where it is now starting to be used. I recognise that we have to be cautious because of consumer reaction, but if by its use export dairy production in particular does increase, say, from the United States or New Zealand, then Australia would have to seriously consider its use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the legislation, as does the coalition. I just say again that I hope that the five pages of amendments that the government has hurriedly made to these bills at the last moment sort out all of the problems with the legislation so that there can be a good start to the new arrangements from 1 July. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My electorate of McMillan is part of Gippsland, which is one of the major dairying areas of Australia. The dairying area in the south of Victoria, which is on the eastern side of Melbourne, has only two electorates&mdash;McMillan and Gippsland. It is one of the premier dairying areas of Australia. It produces 20 per cent of our total production, which is a large proportion of the 61 per cent produced in Victoria, as our national production figures show.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important piece of legislation. The current domestic market support scheme, which operates through a market support payment on exports, does provide a consumer transfer to manufacturing milk producers. This market support payment is classed as an export subsidy under the Uruguay Round and is being terminated on 30 June this year. The replacement policy is for a clearly defined domestic market support scheme to operate from 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These complementary bills give effect to the government's commitment to provide a support mechanism which will deliver a similar level of support as that which would have been delivered under the 1992 dairy plan had the current scheme continued to its scheduled termination on 30 June of the year 2000. As such, the bills continue the secure framework for further adjustment, investment and ongoing rationalisation provided under the 1986 and the 1992 plans, which have been extremely successful in assisting with the improvement of the competitive capability of the Australian dairy industry. The former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in this place, John Kerin, actually set in place much of these benefits for the Australian dairy industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Extensive consultation has taken place among the Australian Dairy Corporation&mdash;it will administer the scheme&mdash;the Australian Dairy Industry Council and the department on refining the operation and the administration of these new arrangements. The new scheme is supported by the dairy industry and the Australian Dairy Corporation. It is pleasing to see that it is also being supported by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme itself will terminate on 30 June in the year 2000, after which there will be no further legislated support to the dairy industry, which will then receive the same level of assistance as that provided to other rural industries. So there is a phasing-in period now where the ongoing adjustment of the industry needs to proceed. We will see at the end of June in the year 2000 an industry well able to stand on its own feet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Support for manufacturing milk producers will be obtained through an inter-sectoral transfer from market milk producers by a levy on market milk and through a transfer from domestic dairy product consumers generated by a levy paid by manufacturers on milk used in manufacturing dairy produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manufacturers recoup the manufacturing milk levy through the price to the domestic consumers or through an export rebate of the amount of levy, but no more than would have been paid on milk in exported product. Levies raised will be paid direct to producers of manufacturing milk by the Australian Dairy Corporation. There should be no change in the price of dairy products to consumers from these arrangements. Also, there will be no Commonwealth liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme is consistent with our GATT and Uruguay Round commitments as it eliminates the export subsidy completely; the support is paid direct to manufacturing milk producers; manufacturers will not receive rebate greater than the levy paid, except for some $15 million in carryover stocks exported, which is minuscule compared with Australia's export subsidy and reduction commitments; and the reductions in the aggregate measure of the domestic support are well within Australia's commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All dairy levies will be changed from a milk fat basis to a milk fat and protein basis consistent with the industry practice in paying for milk delivered to a manufacturer. The manufacturing milk levy rate and hence the level of consumer transfer will be set annually by regulation. In recommending the rate, the minister will take into account a report of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics which will estimate the annual level of support that would have been provided under the 1992 plan, having regard to the limit specified under that plan after consultation with the Australian Dairy Corporation. The total support flowing to manufacturing milk producers will be determined by the foregoing process but will possibly be about $100 million for the consumer transfer and about $35 million for the inter-sectoral transfer in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry practice has been to prepay the expected consumer transfer resulting from the market support payment in the price paid to the producers of milk on delivery. After 30 June 1995, manufacturers will not be able to claim an export support payment on any of the 30 June stock on hand which might be exported. To avoid any disruption to the market and to allow a smooth transition to the new scheme, manufacturers with stocks on hand at 30 June will be able to obtain the export rebate if exported or the consumer transfer if sold on the domestic market. The export rebate on the stocks will create a debt to the domestic market support fund which will be financed by borrowings by the Australian Dairy Corporation and be repaid by producers of manufactured milk over the life of the scheme through a reduction in support payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manufacturers will be allowed an additional one month for payment of the manufacturing levy so as to offset the increased inventory costs associated with moving to the new scheme. The administration of import offsets will be improved by moving to a milk fat and protein basis consistent with the basis of levies and support payments. Import offset provisions are designed to protect the amount of dairy market support flowing to manufacturing milk producers. Without these provisions, anyone could obtain a financial gain by exporting dairy produce that has been imported or displaced from the domestic market by imports and then claiming an export rebate without paying any manufacturing levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, an import offset levy payable by direct importers and an acquisition offset levy payable by a manufacturer who acquires product from an importer who has not paid import offset levy will be imposed on an annual assessment basis. The levies are not a surrogate import levy as the levies are only applied against the export rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the new market support scheme will terminate on 30 June in the year 2000, and the domestic support fund will be wound up as soon as is practical after its termination on 30 June of the same year and in a manner in which there is to be no liability to the Commonwealth. The levy on stocks on hand will be refunded, with any deficit being met from funds administered by the Australian Dairy Corporation or borrowings against those funds&mdash;with any borrowings repaid through the promotion or corporation levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to and reflect upon an article headed `Outlook for the Australian dairy industry' in the ABARE document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Outlook 95</EMPHASIS>. The authors of that article are J. Bills, S. Doyle, V. Topp and T. Gleeson of the Agricultural Economics Branch of ABARE. They say in their document that, after many years of industry restructuring, milk production in Australia boomed in the early 1900s growing by almost nine per cent in 1992-93 and a further 10 per cent in 1993-94. While the increases in production were largely due to excellent seasonal conditions and favourable world prices, they also reflected continuing improvements in herd genetics, supplementary feeding regimes and pasture improvement programs. In an effort to keep up with larger peaks in production and higher volumes, Australian manufacturers have used increased returns from the past two seasons to upgrade many of their facilities and to expand product lines. One Victorian company is currently planning to spend some $200 million upgrading its processing plants over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major issue facing Australian dairy manufacturers, still predominantly cooperatives, is deciding whether to invest in further capital expansion to improve and increase processing capacity in the future. That is a very important issue for the electorates of McMillan and, in particular, Gippsland, as their two major companies are both cooperatives&mdash;Bonlac and Murray Goulburn. At the present time those cooperatives are really starting to put economic pressure on some of the farmers to get them to halt production in order to allow them time to develop greater capacity in factory investment to enable the handling of the great demand that is coming for their products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are real problems in relation to that and to the fact that the cooperative system is not moving quickly enough in today's modern world with the raising of capital. I have been approached by many farmers in my electorate who are not terribly pleased at the moment with the fact that they wish to expand and cannot, with the fact that the cooperatives are holding back funds that would normally be paid to them and returning about half of those funds in the way of a so-called upgrade of the payment by Christmas time and then sending over some share documents saying, `The other half of your money is going into a fund with which we will build a factory in the future.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very out-of-date way of raising funds. It is not good for the industry at the present time, particularly in Gippsland where it is absolutely imperative that the area's resources, farmers, infrastructure that governments have put into roads and everything else that is available there should not be used in the development of a new factory. There needs to be a new process put into place immediately to get that new factory built. We have been doing some local work in relation to it. I am sure that if everybody puts a shoulder to the wheel it can happen. But I have grave doubts that it will happen while we still have just the two cooperative operations. I am a strong believer that we need a third player in the Gippsland area. I believe that we need another factory which will look at the situation centrally in Gippsland&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;which will produce competition, by all means, but also make good use of the natural resource of the area. There is little point in restraining farmers from making the correct decisions which need to be made by holding their money in a fund to build a factory. Their responsibility is to produce the product. It is the role of the managers of the factories and the directors of those companies to make the decisions on raising their finance to enable the building of new factories for the market. If they do not move to start to do that very quickly, they will be deliberately holding back and missing a real and golden opportunity for Gippsland to expand in the areas of production, employment and meeting the world markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World markets at the moment are out there for the taking. For example, Australia developed a product&mdash;infant milk powder&mdash;many years ago. We had the capacity with that product to take lactose out of milk. The tragedy of the old system, prior to the Kerin days, was that none of the factories was prepared to invest in that new technology simply because any investor would have had to share his profits with everybody else. So no-one would take the lead, and we ended up selling that process to the Japanese. It is a bit of a tragedy for Australia today to have to ask the Japanese to bring that technology back to and invest in Australia in order that we might produce a product which we already should have had going out from our ports to the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not everybody can handle the milk powders that we normally make. One of the tragedies I know of in Gippsland at the moment is that factories have been reopened which are producing product which is not what the consumer wants. That will be a burden on the industry for a considerable time if it does not move quickly to change it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been approached by a number of farmers in my electorate&mdash;some of the bigger players in the game, in particular&mdash;who are keen to get to work on a new factory. Many of them have seen what is coming in the world markets, and have moved and gone from the old herringbone style operations. They have made large investments in the new rotary dairies where 120 cows can be put through, per person, per hour, without too much difficulty. I have even played golf with some of these young farmers. Come 4 o'clock I have said, `Gee, you'll be a bit late today in getting home to milk.' They have said, `No problem.' I have asked, `How many are you milking?' and they have said, `Four hundred.' I have then asked `How long will it take you to milk them?' and they have replied, `An hour and 15 minutes.' With the latest technology available, that now is their capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole industry needs to move at this rate. We will have jobs in the offing if people will make those sorts of decisions. I am afraid that the old cooperative days need to be revamped completely and brought up to modern day standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another challenge facing the Australian dairy industry is to maintain its price competitiveness in export markets as production continues to expand. In the past, manufacturers have been particularly successful in gaining access to new and expanding export markets in the growing Asian economies. It seems likely that the Asian region will remain the focus for future export opportunities&mdash;and Gippsland must take part in that. I am pleased to see that at least in northern Victoria some of these things are taking place. The share of Australian exports destined for South-East Asian markets and Japan has grown from 39 per cent back in 1971-72 to 62 per cent in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a growing share of future production likely to be exported, access to new and existing markets is an important issue for Australian exporters. The GATT outcome should and could be a positive one for the world dairy markets because of increased market access provisions and reductions in subsidised exports&mdash;although, from what the member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) said and other information that is available, we are starting to have some grave doubts as to whether some players in GATT are playing according to the rules as they originally said they would. However, the extent to which world dairy markets benefit from trade liberalisation will largely depend on the way GATT commitments are met&mdash;in particular, by the European Union and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few minutes I will talk about the current outlook for Australia. The Australian manufacturing milk prices are forecast to rise to average about 25.6c a litre this year, reflecting expected improvement in world dairy product prices, and the value of Australian dairy exports is forecast to rise by almost 12 per cent to $1,406 million&mdash;a very significant exporter for Australia. The growth largely reflects a significant increase in returns from skim milk powder exports, with both prices and quantities of skim milk powder exported expected to rise substantially in 1993-94. Australia's milk production is forecast to rise by almost two per cent to 8,200 million litres this year. The moderate increase expected this year comes after two years of relatively large increases, reflecting both an increase in cow numbers and more favourable seasonal conditions. However, of course, we know of the limits and restrictions in growth that the drought imposed this year in New South Wales and Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our current farm performances are excellent. Australia's farm cash income for the last year averaged $57,210, which was an eight per cent increase on the 1992-93 figures. Average incomes were relatively stable during 1993-94, with production increases largely offsetting the effects of lower manufactured milk prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the state level, as I have said, New South Wales and Queensland have been affected by the drought. It is expected that their levels will remain very similar in 1994-95, bearing in mind that much of their production still goes towards milk consumption for city people. New South Wales and Queensland dairy farmers certainly have the capacity to keep their production up by importing grain, which is an extra cost on them this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important detail is capital investment in the future. Farmers need to invest in capital items. Some of them need additional land to restructure their farms, some need to build new dairies, and some need to buy new plant and equipment. This appears to occur when we have positive trends in farm cash income, as we have at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results from the ABARE studies on farm management practices also indicate the sorts of productivity gains that result from investment in new milking equipment. For example, the older style walk-through shed averaged 32 cows milked per hour per person. Herringbone sheds average 54 cows, and these new rotary sheds average 124 cows. It is certainly an enormous increase in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A survey produced three years ago showed that herringbone sheds were used on 76 per cent of the surveyed farms and rotary sheds were used on just two per cent of those farms. We can see that the scope for improvement and investment is there. I am sure, from what I am seeing in Gippsland, and, in particular, McMillan, that investment in this new equipment will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I make a plea to those who are involved in decision making processes in the dairy industry and, in particular, the factory production area: these people need to look at the old ways and the new ways of doing things, and perhaps put aside some of the old ways. They have served their purpose by allowing farmers to have a say at all levels of production, but there comes a time when expertise is required&mdash;particularly in world markets where farmers can be quite busy producing the product. Farmers are quite good at that and they should stick to that. Their expertise is required in factory management and factory investment, because this expertise cannot always be found in the cooperatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In supporting this legislation, I am sure that our dairy industry will continue to prosper. Having been a member of this parliament since 1980 and having worked with John Kerin for so long on the adjustments of the dairy industry, it gives me great pride to see the industry still prospering. I wish those working in it all the best for the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I cannot stand here this evening with the same level of hands-on experience in the dairy industry, having had my experience restricted to the one house cow that was kept on our property when I was a boy. For that reason, I do not intend to go through this legislation in the same detail as did the member for Murray and the member for McMillan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a South Australian, I acknowledge that South Australia plays a relatively small role in the Australian dairy industry. The industry tends to be concentrated on the east coast of Australia and in Tasmania. Nonetheless, there are significant players in this industry in South Australia. Those South Australians have been affected, as have their eastern state counterparts, by this move to deregulation. They have not always welcomed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the member for McMillan has every reason to be proud of the government's role in this dairy industry legislation, he should also acknowledge&mdash;as should every government member and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker)&mdash;that part of the process that has occurred in the dairy industry has occurred because the opposition has been prepared to acknowledge the right things that the government has done and, therefore, not to frustrate the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sometimes find that part of the problem of being a participant in these debates is that it is easy for the opposition to say, `We are not opposing this legislation,' and it is easy for the government to say, `We are pleased that the opposition is not opposing this legislation.' But rarely has the government acknowledged the fact that the legislation has progressed through this House and through the Senate as a result of opposition support. Without that support&mdash;particularly in the other place&mdash;it might have been difficult for the government to have delivered what it wanted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those involved in the Australian dairy industry have, as others have said, been involved over the last decade in extensive restructuring and, as a result, have seen real gains for the dairy industry. But these gains have not been without significant pain. As we look at this legislation, we would do well to remember those dairy farmers who were formerly successful&mdash;protected but, nonetheless, successful&mdash;and who have seen the dairy farm disappear because of these necessary but uncomfortable changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who have succeeded have succeeded only in the face of pain, as they have had to go to their bank managers and enter into new borrowing agreements in order to extend their modern dairying facilities&mdash;be they herringbone or rotary, as mentioned by the member for McMillan. Loan repayments have had to be met and this has caused a great deal of angst, as farmers undertook these borrowing ventures not knowing precisely whether the government legislation would be to their advantage or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a success and, as a result, we now have an industry that can proudly claim to be making a contribution in excess of $1 billion per annum to our export economy. It is an industry that, as the member for Murray said, can claim to be the second most efficient dairy industry in the world, matched only by our New Zealand counterparts across the Tasman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before the House proposes to change the way in which support for the dairy industry is collected in Australia. It proposes effectively to make that support GATT legal. The current levy on all milk is GATT illegal, because it is seen effectively as being a support for export milk products as well as domestic milk products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation changes the focus. Instead of the focus being on an all milk levy, it is on a levy on market milk&mdash;which previously did not carry this levy&mdash;and there is an additional levy paid by manufacturers on domestically manufactured milk products. This legislation allows us to have domestic support rather than export support for the industry, so it allows the industry to meet the requirements under the Uruguay Round of GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to focus the attention of members on this popular view of the GATT round, and I want to return to the remarks I made when I first rose to participate in this debate. I think the government's action under GATT is a good illustration of both sides of parliament acting responsibly in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that the popular view in my rural electorate&mdash;and I am sure it is even more marked in urban electorates&mdash;is that both the government and the opposition are somehow GATT gullible. It is a view that has been exacerbated by the Democrats in the other place, because they have run around painting both the government and the opposition as grossly irresponsible for the stance we have taken under GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a view that is further exacerbated by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), because he has never come into this place and acknowledged that the opposition's support of the government's role under GATT has come at a great deal of personal cost to opposition members. It would have been much easier for the opposition to have simply opposed the government's action under GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, the proposal to build a Fortress Australia, to put more bricks in the tariff wall and to supposedly protect Australian industry was much easier to sell in the electorate than the option we have chosen, which is to lower the tariff walls and expose the nation to the cold winds of international trade.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The popular view that we are all GATT gullible would have been in some way watered down if the Prime Minister had been prepared to come in here and acknowledge that the passage of the world trade legislation had been easier because of the opposition's stance and because of the integrity the opposition had brought to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know&mdash;every member of this House knows&mdash;this parliament is not made up of GATT junkies. The reality is that for the parliament, government and opposition, the stance on GATT has been damnably uncomfortable but essential. Only a parliament taking a long-term view of world trade, rather than a short-term view to the next poll, could in fact take this stance. Much of what has been done has been initially unpopular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a view in the community at large that the parliament, both government and opposition, is obsessed with a level playing field, that all that governs and motivates us is this obsession we have with a level playing field and that we as a parliament have been quite prepared to sacrifice the sugar industry, the citrus industry, the pork industry and the dairy industry on the altar of a level playing field. That, frankly, is not so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a background, as everyone knows, in the citrus industry. Citrus growers are anything but happy with our attitude to GATT and with our desire to in fact take some of the bend out of the present world trade playing field and make it a little more level. That does not mean we believe there will ever be a level playing field and it does not mean the government does either. I think government and opposition both accept that the playing field will always be tilted. The GATT legislation has allowed us to take a little of the tilt out of the playing field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I maintain that world trade has always been, and will always be, a dirty card game, but the simple reality is that staying out of the GATT negotiations, building a Fortress Australia, was something the nation could not afford. The member for McMillan made the point that, in industry transfer alone, it could be calculated that the combination of the levy being paid by consumers as a result of this legislation, calculated to be about $100 million, and the levy being paid as a result of intersector transfer, about $35 million, results in about $135 million worth of support that the dairy industry will receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compare that with the European dairy industry, the most protected of all of the primary industries in Europe. Primary industry production in Europe is calculated to cost European taxpayers something like $55 billion per year. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) would know better than I, but they scrape that sort of support out of over 200 million taxpayers. What are we going to do with a mere 10 million taxpayers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot match this no longer level playing field simply by entering into some sort of trade war. That is why as a parliament we agreed to GATT. That is why as a parliament we are entertaining this legislation. We hope to take the tilted playing field&mdash;we know it will never be level&mdash;and take some of the tilt out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this dirty card game that we play, we as a parliament recognise that world trade will go on being dirty. That is inevitable. But as a result of being signatories to GATT, as a result of agreeing to this world trade arrangement, we have at least ensured that for the first time in our trading history all those who want to play around GATT now have to play the dirty card game with their hands on top of the table instead of underneath. So at least we can see what they are doing in the way of supporting their industries, in a legal or illegal manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is designed to ensure that the support that goes to the Australian dairy industry is in fact GATT legal, that our hand of cards can be seen by everybody else. The obligation we have as a parliament is to ensure that the other players, those other traders who are signatories to GATT, are also obliged to show what their hand of cards indicates they are offering their dairy farmers. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that it is still much easier to be a dairy farmer, a citrus farmer or a sugar farmer in any other part of the globe than in Australia because of the level of support received. We cannot match that in dollar terms, so we are endeavouring to match it in agreement terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take, for example, my own experience of the difficulties with world trade in the citrus industry, which can be paralleled with the dairy industry. I have citrus growers bemoaning the fact that while citrus growers and dairy farmers in Australia head towards a five per cent residual tariff by the year 2000 the Israelis currently still enjoy tariff protection of 140 per cent. I know that. The parliamentary secretary by his assent indicates that he is conscious of it. What my growers tend to lose sight of&mdash;so do the dairy farmers&mdash;is that the Israelis have come off a tariff of over 170 per cent. They have forfeited more than we have, even though their residual tariff is still larger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level playing field is not and never will be level, but part of the difficulty, part of the disadvantage, we faced is ironed out by GATT. That is why we support this legislation. That is why we believe this legislation, while it means further adjustments in the dairy industry, is in the long-term interest not only of the dairy industry but also of all Australian exporters. We have an obligation to ensure that all other nations&mdash;in the case of this legislation, all other dairying nations&mdash;also comply with their agreements under GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not wish to introduce an acid note into this debate, the particular obligation the government has, and the particular obligation the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) has, is to ensure that we are not so GATT gullible that we think everyone else is playing with a clean hand of cards. The one criticism the dairy farmers, sugar farmers and citrus farmers have of the arrangements we have under GATT is that it seems we have given away too much too early. Whether the criticism is fair or not, the simple reality is that we can be sure our trading competitors will do all they can to maximise the advantage to their farmers under the GATT arrangements. We need to ensure that we do the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does allow us to ensure that the impact of GATT is cushioned in the dairy industry. Consistent with our support for GATT and with our support for the dairy industry, we, the opposition, are pleased to support the bills before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to participate in this debate and to follow the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), who has provided an erudite insight into the problems of GATT with his particular background in the dried fruit industry, the politics associated with that industry and the international trade pressures on a number of producers in his electorate. I also acknowledge the depth of experience of the member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) of the dairy industry and his contribution to this debate and the previous debates through the 1980s. Likewise, I acknowledge the member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who, again, has participated in these ongoing debates about the changing face of the dairy industry and I note his contribution here this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A recent announcement by the Bonlac company is significant. It announced that it will be investing $11 million worth of capital in its new Melbourne plant and relocating its South-East Asian operations from Singapore back to Melbourne because of the competitive pressures the Singapore economy is now placing on that processing plant. That particular company is now internationally competitive both in terms of the processing and in terms of its ability to sell product in Asia and in north Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate, $30 million has been spent at Cobden on a processing plant with the latest technology for the drying of milk powder. That shows the confidence that Bonlac has in new technology and the export opportunities in the South-East Asian region. Bonlac has sales of some $600 million, employs 2,400 people and 40 per cent of its product is sold, as I say, in the South-East Asian region and in the north African markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bonlac is concentrated in Colac, Camperdown and Cobden and through the Hawkesbury scheme and some parts of its operations are in Gippsland and in northern Victoria. It brings, in the processing sense, an added value to the dairy farmers who are now highly productive and highly efficient in terms of their ability to grow grass and utilise rotary dairies, as the member for McMillan said. New technologies in these areas have made them a far cry from the original dairy farmers whom so much debate in this parliament has been about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the main thrust of this bill, as the member for Wakefield has so rightly identified, is that the opposition and the government have joined forces in supporting a freer trade in the dairy industry following the GATT round. Many members in this House would recall the very heated and strong debates both in electorates and in this parliament about former minister Kerin's plan to change the focus of the dairy industry from an inward looking focus to an export orientation. This legislation completes that process and makes sure that the dairy industry will now, forever and a day, be concentrated in export markets, those growing markets in South-East Asia where profits will be made and maintained and where the profits of certain dairy farmers no longer rely on the domestic high priced milk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all been through that debate and we all understand the arguments that were so vigorously pursued, that doomsday was around the corner. Obviously, the very important factors of subsidised milk products and subsidised farmers in Europe really upset the international market. Again, as the member for Wakefield identified&mdash;and it is worth reiterating&mdash;between $US55 billion and $US60 billion has been pumped into the agriculture support systems of the European common market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 340 million people live in that market and only eight million farmers receive that sort of level of government support. But governments around the world, and of course European governments, are now starting to question the ability of Europeans to subsidise agriculture to that level. Now agricultural production is more related to the market forces and that level of subsidy is no longer available in such massive forms. So we can now make changes here in our own domestic arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with the member for Wakefield, I had a chance to look at what Europeans would consider to be an updated dairy with 20 belgium blue cattle. We inspected that farm early in the morning. I think the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) was there; he is not from a dairy farming background. That farm was a clear demonstration of what the Europeans considered to be efficient and what we in Australia thought to be highly inefficient and would survive only with a massive amount of subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument here in Australia is that fresh milk markets in the capital cities were always profitable because the domestic market could afford to pay for that milk and there was a certain amount of regulation by all state governments of all political colours. This was based on the original concept that fresh milk had to be delivered 365 days a year to the city milk markets from comparatively close dairy farms. State governments had price stabilisation plans, and the low export prices that were generated by international markets further exacerbated this attitude of mine, that we must at all costs make sure that the domestic consumer helps the dairy farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, as other members have indicated, ensures that the Australian parliament and the Australian dairy industry meet GATT legal requirements, that the export subsidies be reduced by 36 per cent. As the member for Wakefield quite rightly identified, it depends from what base these export subsidies are used. The case of Israel, which the member for Wakefield discussed, was from a very high base but here in Australia our export subsidies in the dairy industry are from a comparatively low base. So there is some legitimate argument that the level playing field is not as level as it might be in certain GATT rearrangements depending on what base you start from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GATT arrangements need subsidised exports to be cut by 21 per cent. Again, a similar argument as to what level you start at is involved. We note that in some of these other nations around the world they have started at a very high level. Even though they are reducing it by the statutory requirement, it is not really as good as it might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABARE statistics, which the honourable member for McMillan quoted, give some reason for confidence. When the benefits of the full impact of the Uruguay Round competitive market pressures and genuine outcomes of real prices flow to the dairy producers they will improve cheese prices by 20 per cent, milk powders by 16 per cent and butter by four per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kerin plan, just to remind members of the House, proposed a levy of 45c per kilogram butter fat. That subsidised the dairy exporters who were at that time dealing with a very difficult market. As we have mentioned, the EEC was highly subsidised. So there was some legitimate argument that domestic consumers might contribute at that time to make sure that the dairy farmers remained reasonably profitable. The domestic support scheme that we are now looking at is a value added approach to milk manufacturers who export their product. So we are really looking at this very important concept of those people who manufacture milk products and export are entitled to some help from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the Industry Commission report, in 1992 we see that 27 per cent of the production in Australia was fresh milk; 73 per cent was manufactured, of which a large proportion was exported for the export dollars. As we know, on the fresh milk argument, there was a comfort clause to ensure that state governments and dairy farmers at the capital city level would not interfere with so-called interstate-intrastate competition. Some of us had considerable reservations about these arrangements but inevitably the marketplace has taken over because the pressure from international pricing has now brought about a more realistic assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of Australian exports, Victoria exports a major proportion of Australia's production and is a very efficient industry, along with New Zealand. We see considerable progress in Victoria where both export and domestic demand is being maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The really staggering statistics in the dairy industry, as identified by the Industry Commission report, is that in 1975 we had 43,000 dairy farmers in Australia. Some 20 years later we have about 16,000 dairy farmers left who are very productive and very efficient. The number of dairy cows has decreased from 2.8 million to one million. The other staggering statistic is that those one million dairy cows are now producing 3,800 litres per cow compared to 2,600 litres per cow in 1975. So productivity has gone up; numbers of cows have gone down; and numbers of dairy farmers have gone down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a far cry from the subsidisation of the dairy industry over the 1960s and 1970s when some $30 million of taxpayers' funds were injected into the dairy industry to maintain dairy farmers on small dairy farms which were highly uneconomic. But market forces and a gradual rationalisation of the dairy industry by the factories, by the political process and by commonsense have meant that the dairy industry is now reasonably efficient and has a buoyant future ahead of it without government subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular bill before the House ensures that these arrangements conform to GATT, as other members have pointed out, moving from 22 per cent support payments in 1992-93 down to 11.7 per cent in 1999 to the year 2000. So we have this gradual reduction of the support payments which will be conforming in a genuine sense to the GATT round negotiations. I think we have met our obligations in this parliament and in Australia to keep ourselves internationally competitive without government support or schemes that purport to meet GATT rounds but are in fact under the table type operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Dairy Produce Amendment Act 1992, of which this legislation is a follow-on, extended market support payments for dairy products until 30 June 2000; provided for a phased reduction in the rate of the market support payments for exports of dairy products; and terminated the underwriting of dairy export prices from 30 June 1992. Whilst that is history, it is worth getting it on the record so that all those people in the dairy industry can understand what this parliament has done in a bipartisan sense. It is now not an export subsidy, as it was historically, by the domestic consumer; it is a levy rebated to all exporters. The coalition supports that approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will conclude by discussing some comments by the Victorian Dairy Industry Authority, which was the regulating authority both in terms of price and processes. That authority is chaired by Mr Tom Austin, an excellent chairman and a former minister for agriculture, whose role now is to look at the price arrangements, the quality assurance programs and information technology as it affects the dairy industry. In my discussions with the authority today, they indicate that 60 per cent of milk produced nationally is now produced in Victoria. That authority may adopt a role of quality standards for the rest of Australia in view of the amount of exports that are generated in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, 91 per cent of the milk products are used in the manufacturing sense, at approximately 25c per litre; and nine per cent of its production is in the fresh milk market, which is about 50c per litre at the farm gate. Members of the House would appreciate that there is a premium for those farmers who supply that fresh milk market. In view of the way in which the dairy industry authority used to operate, I was encouraged by the comments of the general manager, Mr Doug Weir, on 31 August which indicate a massive change of attitude by leaders in the dairy industry. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the shake-out really began 30 years ago when Britain joined the Common Market, closing Australia's traditional export market for butter and cheese.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The industry was slow to recover from the shock and, of the 50,000 dairy farmers in the State then, only the toughest and the very best have survived.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to make this interesting comment, which shows a remarkable change of attitude by the industry leaders:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've had to learn and explore new markets and new products as a matter of survival . . . consequently we have today an industry highly productive, internationally competitive, market-oriented and has great growth potential."</PARA>
<PARA>I think that sums up what we are now facing in the industry. It is an export based industry; with growth markets in Asia; with Europe being more sensible about its agricultural policies; with the fresh milk market supporting the other capital cities&mdash;that is, Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth&mdash;and with Victoria and Tasmania being the predominant providers of export milk products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Given that the USA pays lip-service to and, hopefully, will support the Uruguay Round commitments&mdash;Canada likewise&mdash;and that the Europeans are under considerable political pressure, I think the dairy industry can look forward to a very confident future. Because we are very efficient in Australia, we can compete with New Zealand. The new technology of pastures, rotary dairies and genetics in the dairy herd all add up to the Australian dairy farmer being the best in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I might say that part of my own electorate of Corangamite could end up being the centre of the dairy industry in Australia, if not the world. The rainfall pattern, the soil type, the value of the land and the dairy farmers' preparedness to make management changes have indicated that they are in the forefront of dairy technology. This bill before the parliament will enhance that view. It will ensure that they are out in the cold world of international competition; that they are competitive at that level; that they are profitable; and that they have a very sound future&mdash;if anyone can say that people in primary production have a sound future on world markets. </PARA>

<PARA>The Budget that I deliver tonight has one principal objective: to provide for the continued expansion of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>It will enable the continuation of substantial employment growth, falling unemployment and rising living standards, while reducing pressure on interest rates, inflation and the current account. </PARA>
<PARA>It will do so by tackling the major constraint on growth: the long term decline of our national savings. A higher level of national savings will allow higher levels of investment and economic growth without the costs and constraints associated with undue reliance on the savings of foreigners. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget provides a two part plan to improve Australia's saving performance, immediately and over the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, it increases public saving. </PARA>
<PARA>The Budget delivers a surplus in 1995-96 of $718 million. This is a massive turnaround in the budget outcome of $12.9 billion or 2.8 per cent of GDP. It is the largest ever turnaround in the budget outcome. It brings the Budget into surplus 3 years earlier than previously forecast. </PARA>
<PARA>This is achieved by cuts to spending, increases in revenue, and asset sales, including part of the proceeds from the sale of the Government's remaining equity in the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>Importantly, the Budget for 1996-97 will be in surplus excluding asset sales and special debt and capital repayments. </PARA>
<PARA>And the budget surplus by 1998-99 will be $7.4 billion or 1.2 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, this Budget will introduce a major increase in private saving in the medium to longer term by the progressive introduction of employee superannuation contributions, with the second round of the One Nation tax cuts paid on a matching dollar for dollar basis into employee superannuation accounts. </PARA>
<PARA>Together with the Superannuation Guarantee and existing award superannuation this initiative will, within a generation, boost Australia's annual saving performance by 4 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA>The return to budget surplus will reduce Commonwealth Government debt, which is already well below the average for OECD countries, by almost 30 per cent as a share of GDP over the next 4 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight's Budget also addresses immediate high priority needs with new measures for families, health care, the environment and justice. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">FISCAL TIGHTENING</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, the return of the budget outcome to surplus in 1995-96, and to substantial surplus in 1996-97 and beyond, fulfils the Government's promise to significantly tighten fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA>The measures announced tonight provide a net fiscal tightening, excluding the effects of asset sales and early debt redemptions, of $3 billion in 1995-96 and $4 1/2 billion in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA>On the outlays side this tightening has been accomplished by a rigorous examination of all areas of government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>The decisions I am announcing produce a net reduction in outlays of $700 million in 1995-96 excluding asset sales and early debt redemptions. Overall, a real reduction in outlays of 2.5 per cent has been achieved, the first real reduction since 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>Outlays are projected to fall from 26.7 per cent of GDP in 1994-95 to 24 per cent of GDP in 1998-99, demonstrating the Government's determination to reduce its call on national saving. </PARA>
<PARA>Total taxation revenue collected by the Government as a share of GDP declined in each of the 6 years between 1987-88 and 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA>The revenue measures that I am announcing tonight strengthen the Commonwealth's tax base and provide a significant contribution to improving the budget outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>In all they add $2.4 billion to revenue in 1995-96 and $3.6 billion in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA>But even after allowing for these measures, budget balance will be restored with revenue much lower, in relation to GDP, than in the past. When we last moved into surplus in 1987-88 revenue represented 27.2 per cent of GDP compared to an estimated 25.3 per cent in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA>Our fiscal policy compares more than favourably with that of most other industrialised countries and, amongst such countries, we will continue to be one of the lowest taxed. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">SUPERANNUATION</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, one of the principal objectives of this Budget is to meet the medium term imperative of improving national saving to maintain investment and employment through the 1990s and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight I can announce, on behalf of the Government, a radical and innovative program to meet that challenge and further decrease Australia's reliance on foreign borrowings. This initiative complements the addition to Australia's savings arising from the budget surplus. It meets a goal and establishes a commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>The goal is better retirement incomes for Australians. The commitment, simultaneously established, is to substantially increase the nation's savings.</PARA>
<PARA>The measure will build on one of the most far-reaching steps taken during the Government's years of office&mdash;the development of Australia's superannuation and retirement incomes policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight's announcement will dramatically strengthen and extend that policy. It will not only sharply increase the incomes of Australians in retirement, but will also build a large pool of savings to finance the nation's continuing prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA>This initiative has two elements, an employee superannuation contribution and a matching government contribution. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, in One Nation we said, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>"The Government will be giving consideration to using employee contributions and tax cuts to increase the total level of superannuation support by a further 3 per cent of earnings."</PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that this is the time to do so&mdash;in fact, we believe there is now a need to go beyond the objectives we set then. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, under tonight's initiative, the Government will support the inclusion in all awards of provisions for employee superannuation contributions beginning at 1 per cent of earnings in July 1997 and rising to 3 per cent of earnings by July 1999. </PARA>
<PARA>This will be timed to coincide with wage increases through enterprise agreements or awards, so that workers will not experience a reduction in disposable income. </PARA>
<PARA>The second element, Mr Speaker, is that the Government will match dollar for dollar the contributions paid by most employees into their superannuation accounts&mdash;a government contribution, when fully phased in, of $4 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA>By paying the One Nation tax cuts into employees' superannuation accounts we are delivering them in a way that significantly improves national saving. </PARA>
<PARA>Together, additional contributions will add 6 per cent of wages to the superannuation of people earning around average incomes. By 2002 this will build on the 9 per cent contribution from employers under the Superannuation Guarantee arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>This new initiative will, therefore, lift the superannuation savings for a person on around average earnings to a minimum of 15 per cent of their wages. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to make it abundantly clear, however, that the Government continues to see the age pension as the foundation stone of our retirement incomes policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight's arrangements build on the existing pension system. </PARA>
<PARA>For a couple on average earnings, now in their mid 30s, the Government's initiatives deliver retirement incomes 75 per cent higher than the age pension. </PARA>
<PARA>For their children joining the workforce in the next decade, retirement incomes will be more than double the age pension. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, the new policy has been designed to benefit low and middle income earners. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, employees currently contributing to superannuation will not need to make additional contributions to be eligible for the matching government payment. </PARA>
<PARA>The government contribution will be means tested. The Government will match contributions up to a limit of around $1 000 per annum for all workers earning less than around $46 000. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will enable the self-employed to claim the matching government contribution on a proportion of their superannuation savings. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, for equity reasons, the existing means-tested rebate for member contributions will be retained. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, the policy announced tonight will change forever the expectations of workers as they move towards retirement age. </PARA>
<PARA>It will give Australia a comprehensive long-term private savings plan&mdash;one that could not have been contemplated without the ground breaking work on superannuation done by this Labor Government since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable members that in 1983, after decades of neglect by the Liberal and National parties, less than 40 per cent of all employees had superannuation coverage. Today, as a result of our reforms, that total is nearly 90 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>For women, the increased coverage from the previous initiatives of this Government has been even more spectacular, rising from 24 per cent in 1983 to 85 per cent today. Thus women now have a major stake in superannuation&mdash;and it will be a bigger stake after the Budget's measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Today superannuation savings have already reached $186 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>But, Mr Speaker, under the policy announced tonight that figure will increase tenfold by the year 2020. </PARA>
<PARA>Together with our earlier reforms, tonight's initiatives are estimated to further increase national saving progressively by around 2 per cent of GDP per year by the end of the decade. When fully implemented, they will add 4 per cent of GDP per year to national saving. In today's values that means an increase in saving in the order of $18 billion per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>These new superannuation measures will be extremely good for Australian workers and their families, and just as good for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">ECONOMIC AND EMPLOYMENT GROWTH</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, Australia's economy has been growing for 3 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA>During this time, Australia has had one of the best performing economies among industrialised countries. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1994, Australia was among the fastest growing industrialised countries, but with inflation below the average of these countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Notwithstanding the severe drought which has affected much of eastern Australia, GDP growth is expected to be 4 3/4 per cent in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA>And this growth has been broadly based. </PARA>
<PARA>Business investment, which has been growing since late 1992, is expected to grow by 18 per cent this fiscal year. </PARA>
<PARA>Employment has grown by 4.2 per cent over the 12 months to March 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>By delivering around 550 000 new jobs since April 1993, the Government has already surpassed its election commitment to create half a million jobs in this term of office. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen to 8.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>The number of long term unemployed people has fallen by 25 per cent over the 12 months to March 1995 as the Government's Working Nation program continues to assist them into jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>Critical to maintaining this strong growth in activity and employment has been the maintenance of low inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's inflation rate has been below that of our major trading partners over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Low inflation is the result of reforms to the structure of our economy over the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA>A key factor has been the success of the Government's wages policy and industrial relations reforms through the Accord, which is unique to this Labor Government and rejected by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>Business is facing an increasingly competitive environment. </PARA>
<PARA>With protection reduced and markets opened to competition, businesses are increasingly required to adopt international standards of best practice. </PARA>
<PARA>Widespread microeconomic reforms have also resulted in a more competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA>The recent historic agreement between the Commonwealth and the States to implement the national competition policy reforms will, in conjunction with related reforms in industries such as energy and transport, further raise the level of competition in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>All these developments are keeping production costs and therefore inflationary pressures down. </PARA>
<PARA>An added benefit of this restraint in prices and wages is that it puts less pressure on monetary policy, and reduces the need for increases in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of these improvements in labour and product markets, Australia's international competitiveness is now 18 per cent higher than in the September quarter 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, rapid growth in domestic demand, particularly for investment goods, has led to a sharp rise in imports. In addition, adverse effects on our exports from drought and the hesitant recovery in Japan have increased our current account deficit to an estimated 6 per cent of GDP this year. </PARA>
<PARA>Tackling this problem is largely what this Budget is about. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">OUTLOOK FOR 1995-96</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, in 1995-96 GDP growth will ease from the higher rates recorded in 1994 but will remain strong, at around 3 3/4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Domestic demand will move more into line with growth in output as a result of:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a slight moderation in private consumption;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a continued decline in dwelling investment as housing construction eases back toward underlying demand; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a slowing in public demand growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Export growth should be rapid as world demand continues to grow strongly and the effects of the drought begin to ease. Reduced domestic demand will lead to a decline in the growth of imports. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite an offsetting increase in our net income deficit due to higher world interest rates, the current account deficit is expected to decline by  1/2 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA>Wage growth is expected to be higher in 1995-96 but, in the context of enterprise bargaining and continued improvements in productivity, it should remain compatible with maintaining an underlying inflation rate around 2 to 3 per cent on average over the course of the economic cycle. </PARA>
<PARA>This favourable outlook is strongly supported by the union movement's commitment to responsible wage outcomes under the Accord. </PARA>
<PARA>And achievement of this goal will be further aided by the spread of enterprise bargaining throughout the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>Employers and employees are taking advantage of the new system by making work practices more flexible, thus improving our productivity performance and providing a firm basis for wage rises for Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA>A new Accord is being negotiated with the ACTU, which will underpin the continuation of responsible wage outcomes and low inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Business investment is expected to remain strong in 1995-96, rising by around 13 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>This will contribute to growth in the capital stock and help maintain economic growth without supply bottlenecks triggering higher inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Employment will continue to grow strongly, by about 3 per cent or over 240 000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>The unemployment rate should fall to around 8 per cent by mid-1996. </PARA>
<PARA>Real household disposable income is forecast to increase by 4 1/4 per cent, following this year's 4 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, the economic environment facing us over the next few years is one that offers great national opportunities, and great opportunities for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget's savings strategy will allow us to maximise these opportunities for economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">FAMILIES</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, I turn now to other significant measures in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget includes a major statement on our Agenda for Families which responds to the issues raised during the International Year of the Family. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will provide further practical support for families through the initiatives I am announcing tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>A new means tested maternity allowance of $816 will be introduced from 1 February 1996. It will provide a vital boost to family income when it is most needed: on the birth of a baby. </PARA>
<PARA>About 85 per cent of women will be eligible for the payment which will be available to women both at home and in paid employment. </PARA>
<PARA>The level of Guardians Allowance paid to sole parent pensioners will be increased by $4 a fortnight from September 1996. Rent assistance will also be increased by $5 a fortnight from March 1996 for families with children. </PARA>
<PARA>Both these measures build on significant real improvements in family payments made to low income families over the life of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>From July 1995 the new Parenting Allowance which was announced as part of Working Nation will provide about 115 000 low income working families with an average gain of $59 a week. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, tonight's Budget also focuses on the health needs of families through preventative health care measures for children and young people. </PARA>
<PARA>To raise the immunisation rates among our children and so reduce the incidence of preventable diseases, a National Childhood Immunisation Program costing $11m in 1995-96 will be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>A new `Health Australia' program provides $18m over 3 years for measures to strengthen health promotion and reduce the consumption of tobacco, particularly among young people. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, the Government will continue to help families meet the challenges faced by competing work and family responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will deliver on its 1993 promise to meet the projected demand for work related care by 2000-01. </PARA>
<PARA>In this Budget we have taken steps to ensure that the focus is on meeting the needs of working parents, while providing equitable access to subsidised child care for parents who stay at home with their children. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will also provide additional financial support to carers of older people and disabled people, and will promote the role of carers in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of the measures to be announced in the Government's forthcoming Justice Statement will help families to avoid legal problems and deal with disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>Families of indigenous Australians remain seriously disadvantaged. In this Budget, the Government will build on past initiatives by spending an additional $204m over 4 years to improve the standard of health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">OTHER OUTLAYS MEASURES</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, to reduce spending, the Government looked first at the cost of delivering its own programs. </PARA>
<PARA>Indexation arrangements for both Commonwealth Own Purpose Outlays and Specific Purpose Payments to the States with substantial wage costs are to be rationalised from 1 July 1995 producing savings of almost $2 billion over the next 4 years. </PARA>
<PARA>The changes will not apply to personal benefit payments&mdash;that is, there will be no change to indexation arrangements for pensions, allowances and other income support payments. </PARA>
<PARA>Reductions in administrative costs of departments and agencies will produce savings of around $640m over the next 4 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Together with a range of efficiency and other measures already adopted by the Government over recent years, this will lead to a reduction in administrative costs of 15 per cent in real terms over the next 4 years. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has also been able to reduce spending on labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA>These savings will not jeopardise achievement of the Government's Working Nation targets. They result largely from more efficient delivery of programs and a stronger labour market. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget also includes measures to simplify the income test applying to pensions through the introduction of a deeming system on financial investments only. It will replace the current system of assessment of unrealised capital growth on shares and managed investments. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will take steps to reduce the rapid escalation of some health program costs. </PARA>
<PARA>New arrangements for delivering pathology services and an increase in the safety net threshold for general patients under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from $407 to $600 from 1 January 1996 will provide substantial savings.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government reaffirms its election commitment to support health research by increasing funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council by $58m over 4 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, for the higher education sector there is a budget-neutral package which will provide 5850 new higher education places over the next 3 years and increased funding for research infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>An additional $217m over 4 years will be provided for initiatives to protect our natural environment, with particular emphasis on our coastline and our native forests. </PARA>
<PARA>We will accelerate implementation of the National Forest Policy Statement through a $53m package over 4 years to undertake comprehensive regional forest assessments in five high priority areas and conclude associated regional forest agreements with the States. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government also remains determined to improve the urban environment with a further $254m over 4 years for the Better Cities Program. </PARA>
<PARA>In a major addition to our transport infrastructure, international and domestic airport facilities will be constructed at Sydney West in time for the Sydney 2000 Olympics. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight I am announcing further developments in the Government's asset sales program. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government proposes to sell and lease-back DASFLEET's motor vehicle fleet this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's remaining 50.4 per cent equity in the Commonwealth Bank will be sold in two tranches, one in 1995-96 and one in 1997-98. </PARA>
<PARA>The sale will complete the process of putting the ownership of the Bank on a fully commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">REVENUE</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, the revenue side of the Budget will also play its part in fiscal tightening. </PARA>
<PARA>With the strong economic recovery, the corporate profit share has returned to the record levels of the mid 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>Companies in Australia have also benefited from a number of tax concessions in recent years to stimulate business activity. They include investment allowances, accelerated depreciation, the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession and a large reduction in the company tax rate from 39 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>These measures will be providing a benefit of more than $3 billion to businesses in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA>Now that the economy is growing strongly it is appropriate that the corporate sector make a contribution to the tightening of fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the rate of company income tax will be increased from 33 to 36 per cent for the 1995-96 and subsequent income years. </PARA>
<PARA>This measure will add $320m to revenue in 1995-96 and $1,570m in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA>The One Nation statement reduced the wholesale sales tax on passenger motor vehicles by 5 per cent to stimulate demand. </PARA>
<PARA>Now that passenger motor vehicle sales are at a high level, it is appropriate to restore the sales tax rate to the general rate of 21 per cent from tonight.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has also decided that, from 1 July 1995, sales tax at the concessional 12 per cent rate will apply to currently exempt builders' hardware and certain building materials used mainly in the completion of buildings. </PARA>
<PARA>The bulk of building materials used in construction, such as bricks, timber, cement and roofing tiles, will remain exempt. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, Medicare levy receipts as a proportion of Medicare outlays have fallen from over 30 per cent in 1988-89 to an expected 24 per cent in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA>Tonight I am announcing an increase in the Medicare levy from 1.4 to 1.5 per cent which will partially reverse this decline. </PARA>
<PARA>The excise rate on tobacco will rise by 10 per cent from tonight. This will replace the 5 per cent increase originally scheduled for August 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>In recent years evidence has emerged of an erosion of the PAYE tax base, where individuals have attempted to move out of traditional employer/employee relationships in order to avoid tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the Government will be amending the income tax law to ensure the intended coverage of the PAYE provisions can be enforced. I will also be releasing soon a discussion paper dealing with the use of other schemes to avoid tax on personal services income. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to reduce deferral of tax payments under the PAYE system, the threshold at which bi-monthly remittance is required will be reduced to $1m per year. Generally, this measure will affect companies with around 120 employees or more. </PARA>
<PARA>To protect the revenue base, I am also announcing tonight measures to correct a number of deficiencies in the tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA>Eligibility for the research and development tax concession for syndicates investing in private tax exempt bodies will be limited to exclude investors who are not fully at risk. </PARA>
<PARA>This measure will prevent inappropriate access to tax benefits, and parallels a 1992 measure applying to public sector tax exempt research bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>There will be clarification of certain wholesale sales tax rate classifications including removal of the tax exemption for non-permanent microchips used in certain goods. The current exemption has proved virtually impossible to administer, introduced significant distortions and inefficiencies in the market, and caused considerable loss of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>`Light' fuel oils, which are in effect industrial diesel fuels, will be made subject to excise in the same way as diesel fuels. This is designed to address the tax-driven substitution of `light' fuel oil for diesel which is taking place at some cost to economic efficiency and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>From 1 July 1995, the interest rate which the Reserve Bank of Australia pays banks on their non-callable deposits will be set at 5 percentage points below market rates. This measure recognises the benefits which accrue to banks from being authorised by the Government and subject to RBA prudential supervision. </PARA>
<PARA>More detail on each of these and other revenue measures is contained in the budget papers and accompanying statements. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">CONCLUDING COMMENTS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, tonight's Budget responds to the economic challenges facing Australia today and in the years ahead in a creative and decisive way. </PARA>
<PARA>It presents a comprehensive plan to address the deficiency in our national saving. </PARA>
<PARA>The immediate restoration of the budget to surplus and the major enhancement to Australia's superannuation arrangements will dramatically boost our savings performance. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, we have improved the level of social justice so that all Australians benefit from our economic progress. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the past dozen years, Australia has undergone a transformation which has made our economy far more competitive, efficient and dynamic than was ever previously imagined. </PARA>
<PARA>We are now well placed to capitalise on these improvements. </PARA>
<PARA>With continued diligence, hard work, preparedness to change, and intelligent application of our collective skills, we can confidently look forward to a secure and prosperous future for this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Budget to the House. </PARA>

The purpose of the strategy is to assess the effectiveness of the measures over a four year period and progressively to identify any policy adjustments required. The evaluation strategy is in five parts, covering the Job Compact, entry level training enhancements, the Youth Training Initiative, improved service delivery (including case management) and the impact of the initiatives on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. A report of the evaluation will be available in 1998, with an interim report to be published two years earlier.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Review officers endeavour to ensure that their decisions do not create arrears for non-custodians or over-payments for custodians unless the circumstances of the case warrant such action.

However, both parties are required to satisfy the review officer of the accuracy of information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) No. To keep the review process simple and inexpensive, representation is not permitted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from the question of the extensive resources necessary to obtain the information sought, which I do not consider is warranted, it should be noted that, in general, the deliberations of Ministerial Councils are, unless all members agree otherwise, confidential. This principle was re-affirmed following a review of Ministerial Councils in 1993 by the Council of Australian Governments. In the absence of State and Territory agreement, this would preclude providing information of the kind sought by the honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, Ministerial Councils differ in the nature of their work, procedures and frequency of meetings. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, for example, meets three times a year and currently has over 55 matters on the Agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Ministerial Councils that have a decision making role, including the preparation of Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation, issues and proposals of concern to the Commonwealth are not necessarily raised at the request of the Commonwealth. Where significant legislative proposals are involved, these may take several years to bring to fruition and it is often difficult to determine at what particular stage of the process a jurisdiction endorses the proposal. Indeed, in some cases changes in the membership of a Council may result in a different response by a jurisdiction during this process to one previously given. In other cases decisions can be made on a majority vote which may bind other jurisdictions. Thus, even if it were appropriate to provide the information sought by the honourable member, in many cases the way the issue arose, its nature and the process involved in reaching a decision would not lend itself to a straightforward answer of the kind that appears to be contemplated by the question.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr Lawrence</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) and (2) A licensing scheme for pathology specimen collection centres was introduced from 1 February 1992, as part of a series of reforms announced in the 1991-92 Budget to achieve a more cost effective and efficient pathology industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the scheme, all privately owned Approved Pathology Authorities (APAs) are required to hold a licence for each of their pathology specimen collection centres for Medicare benefits' payment purposes. Licences are issued for annual periods commencing 1 February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of centres licensed under the scheme and their location are influenced by a range of factors and these need to be borne in mind when considering the matter of centre closures since January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, one of the stated aims of the scheme was to reduce the number of collection centres across Australia through the phasing out of temporary centres over the first two years and the introduction of a limit on the number of centres licensed in a year. These measures were in response to concerns that there were too many centres in Australia leading to inefficiencies and increased costs to Medicare and the community. In all, 603 temporary centres were closed under these arrangements with 315 closures occurring in the twelve months from 1 February 1993. Attachment A provides State/Territory details of these closures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, a set number of centres is licensed each year under the scheme. The number of centres licensed Australia-wide has been stable with 1121 centres licensed at 1 February 1994 and 1157 at 1 February 1995. These compare with 1049 permanent collection centres licensed under the scheme at 1 February 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the location of centres licensed under the scheme is decided by APAs based on commercial and other factors. During the annual licensing period, APAs may choose to close a centre completely or move a centre to another location. Data on the number for each of these categories is not available separately and, thus, it is not possible to provide details of centre closures under these arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as Attachment B indicates, the number of centres licensed by State/Territory has been relatively stable over the last three years suggesting that APAs do not close centres but rather relocate centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, a financial incentive has been incorporated in the scheme to encourage APAs to locate centres in particular areas and thus promote rural and remote Australians access to pathology specimen collection services. Under these arrangements, a licence can cover three centres for specified rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the licensing scheme is to be reviewed in 1995 in the light of concerns about its efficiency and effectiveness in delivering collection services to the Australian community. The review will be undertaken as a joint effort with the pathology profession and industry through the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia and the Australian Association of Pathology Practices. The review will be completed to enable its results to be implemented from 1 February 1996.</PARA>

Forensic examination by Australian Federal Police (AFP) forensic experts is obtained free of charge. Where evidence is required urgently or where the police indicate some uncertainty as to the bona fides of a document, further evidence is sometimes sought from an independent forensic expert.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. The Government regularly raises a range of human rights concerns with the Indonesian Government, in the context of our constructive dialogue on these issues. Over the last six months, the Government has raised a number of human rights issues apart from East Timor. These include, for instance, the gaoling of an independent trade union leader; the possible effect of a draft Presidential decree regulating NGOs; the closure of three magazines and reported extrajudicial killings of suspected criminals in the lead-up to the Bogor APEC meeting. These concerns have been raised through representations at Ministerial and diplomatic levels and in public statements. In addition, the Government supported a consensus statement made on 8 March by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which expressed concern about the human rights situation in East Timor. The Government will continue to pursue its human rights concerns in the region through public statements; bilateral representations on specific human rights issues; assistance, where requested, in the building of human rights institutions, including in Indonesia; encouraging the ratification of international human rights conventions and cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms and encouraging positive human rights trends within the region. Most recently, I expressed the Government's concerns about human rights, and in particular the deteriorating situation in East Timor, during a meeting with the Indonesian Foreign Minister in Jakarta on 21 February this year. The Australian Ambassador to Indonesia reiterated the Government's concern at the situation in East Timor to the Indonesian authorities during his visit to that province from 9-14 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The deployment and conduct of foreign military personnel on return to their home countries after training in Australia are the responsibilities of their governments. Foreign military personnel attending courses in Australia generally undertake the same training as Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel. ADF training provided to the Indonesian Armed Forces is directed towards the development of professional military skills. We do not provide training to Indonesian military personnel which is related to the internal security function of the Indonesian Armed Forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Government believes that a more substantial relationship with Indonesia will, in general, mean that we can pursue our specific objectives, including human rights objectives, more successfully. Simply put, if we have a strong relationship with a Government on a range of issues it is more likely to listen to our concerns on sensitive issues such as human rights. The Government believes that this consistent approach has contributed to improvements in the human rights situation in Indonesia&mdash;in the observance of human rights in individual cases, human rights education and building institutions to protect rights. It has also led, for instance, to the Indonesian Government inviting the participation of Australia's then Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, to a National Human Rights workshop in August 1994. At this meeting the Indonesian Government and the United Nations Centre for Human Rights agreed, among other things, to develop a National Action Plan for Human Rights in Indonesia&mdash;the concept of national action plans was, in fact, an initiative of the Australian Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Oberon Class submarines at sea do dispose of waste in cloth bags. The disposal of garbage at sea is dictated by a number of factors, including operational and habitability considerations. If garbage in the submarine reaches excessive levels, habitability requirements for the crew necessitate its disposal. This is effected when submerged by the use of the garbage ejector and when surfaced from the bridge. The submarine's program and movements are considered when disposing of garbage. Garbage is stored for disposal ashore if the program and habitability constraints permit. During this period, garbage will be stored in the accommodation space hatch area. The location of the submarine is a further consideration, with the prohibited areas being rigorously observed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Garbage disposal places certain operational limitations on a submarine with respect to disclosure of its presence. All submariners are indoctrinated from initial training in the need to reduce garbage and to avoid the inclusion of oily waste in garbage. In addition, bagged garbage is to be subjected to water pressure prior to discharge to ensure that all expelled garbage sinks immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Royal Australian Navy (RAN) submarines generate minimal plastic waste, the disposal of which is prohibited under the international policy. This plastic is retained in the submarine for discharge ashore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Gash is a traditional naval term defined "remnants of a meal; leavings or pickings". Within the RAN, gash is the accepted term for all manner of waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Oberon class submarines are fitted with a gash ejector to discharge bagged garbage from the submarine. The procedures for use of the garbage ejector ensure that all garbage immediately sinks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) When the submarine is surfaced, garbage is discharged from the bridge. The garbage remains bagged and, with the exception of being subjected to pressure, fulfils the same criteria as for expelling garbage when submerged. The garbage is weighted such that the bag sinks. For operational and environmental reasons, loose garbage is not discharged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the submarine is on surface passage through an area where garbage cannot be discharged (e.g. Great Barrier Reef), bagged garbage is often stored in the fin as a temporary holding measure.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr Lawrence</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The APMA, in a circular to its members on 7 September 1994, advised that free advertising support (approximately $850,000&mdash;$1,000,000) had been offered by publishers of all key medical tabloids and journals and pharmacy tabloids and journals, for the next twelve months. The purpose of the free advertising is to encourage doctors to routinely prescribe original brand products. This action is considered to be against the spirit and intention of the Government's policy on brand substitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On 7 February 1995 I served notice in the House that if the APMA's campaign persisted, the Government would take further action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Human Services and Health has been closely monitoring the campaign and has raised concerns with the APMA and the Trade Practices Commission where it felt aspects are in contravention of the Industry's Code of Ethics or the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The APMA, expecting a delay in the production and issue of new prescription pads containing a box for choosing whether or not to recommend brand substitution, has issued doctors with self-inking stamps bearing the message "Brand substitution not permitted".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the House on 7 February 1995, I served notice on the APMA that, if the campaign results in doctors misusing their veto powers, new prescription pads, which would have made it easier for doctors to simply tick a box to indicate that they did not want the drugs interchanged, would not be issued and the use of rubber stamps would be outlawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Department has written to the Trade Practices Commission seeking advice on whether the APMA campaign is in breach of Part IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974. To date no reply has been received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Yes, I did inform the House on 7 February 1995 that the APMA's campaign against brand substitution was trying to encourage the medical profession not to use its clinical judgement about whether there is a good reason not to have brand substitution for a particular patient, but to veto automatically, apparently in order to support the commercial interests of APMA members. I believe that it is not sufficient to accept that the doctors' and the industry's interests outweigh those of the patient. My opinion is firm on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) It is calculated that, on average, brand substitution will result in a saving to the patient in the order of $1.40 per prescription. The legislation relating to brand substitution was introduced as a cost saving measure for all Australians and as a consumer's right to choose and the Government will continue to defend it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The Department is currently developing an information campaign on a range of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme issues. A major priority for this campaign will be informing consumers of their right of access to low cost prescription medicines. It is anticipated that the campaign will be underway by mid-1995. Moreover, the Consumers Health Forum has received a grant from the Department to raise awareness among consumers on pharmaceutical issues. Some of this money is being used to specifically raise awareness of brand substitution.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Only direct child care costs incurred in working, studying, training and looking for work are considered a work related expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)(a) &amp; (b) The Childcare Cash Rebate recognises that child care costs, like many other costs associated with employment, are a legitimate work related expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The receipt of Home Child Care Allowance is not detrimental to the status of women who stay at home to look after their children. Home Child Care Allowance has been introduced by the Government in recognition of the important contribution made by partners who remain substantially out of the workforce to care for their children. Issues of equity and justice were central to the Government's decision to introduce the Home Child Care Allowance. An estimated 55,000 low income families who received little benefit from the Dependent Spouse Rebate are able to receive up to $61 a fortnight under the Home Child Care Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Home Child Care Allowance is only one of several payments available through the social security system which assist families. In the vast majority of cases, people eligible for Home Child Care Allowance would already be receiving some other form of assistance from the Department of Social Security. For example, Basic Family Payment is paid in respect of over 3.5 million children and is received by most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, payment of Home Child Care Allowance through the social security system allows the payment to be directed to the primary care giver, usually the mother. This policy advances the status of women and is a significant improvement over providing a rebate through the taxation system which directs the payment to the primary wage earner, usually the father.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the payment of the Home Child Care Allowance through the social security system is more responsive to changes in a person's financial circumstances, so that the assistance is available when it is needed. For example, when a woman ceases work as a result of the birth of her child, her financial circumstances will have changed and she will be eligible to claim Home Child Care Allowance immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) A major new initiative, the Parenting Allowance, will commence on 1 July 1995. The Parenting Allowance is a non-activity tested payment for families, which is available to either member of a couple who is caring for children, although this is most often the woman. The allowance will be available to partners of income support recipients and low income earners who have dependent children under 16. It will incorporate, and go beyond, the Home Child Care Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A feature of the new allowance is that low income families will have a greater degree of choice about whether one partner will stay at home and care for their children; a choice generally available up to now only to those on higher incomes. Around 117,000 low-income families are expected to gain around $59 a week from Parenting Allowance. At the same time, the entitlement of most higher income families to the basic parenting allowance component that is currently Home Child Care Allowance will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parenting Allowance initiative will give the partner caring for the children an independent source of income, recognising still further the valuable work of the child carer at home.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My department tendered for and obtained 1273 new and refurbished convenience photocopiers on a non-purchase basis. The agreement with the supplier is classified as an operating lease based on a click charge or cost per copy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) All purchasing procedures and contractual arrangements conformed with the Department of Administrative Services' purchasing guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Given that the contract was accepted on the basis that its content would be kept confidential, the precise terms of the contract cannot be disclosed. However, the draft terms and conditions of contract used as the base for negotiations with Canon Australia were contained in the Request for Tender documentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The contract provides for all servicing of the machinery and no other non-contract items were agreed by the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) There was no duplication of purchasing services as the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) does not provide a common use contract for the supply of click charge (or cost per copy) photocopying services. The Department understands that DAS will issue such a contract in the near future. Members of the Department's procurement team have provided some advice to DAS on the development of a common use click charge contract and to other agencies who are developing their own request for tenders at present. The draft terms and conditions of contract prepared for the DEET Request for Tender have been provided to DAS to assist in preparing a click charge Common Use Contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) Copiers provided under the contract are not rented. Under the operating lease the contractor amortises the capital cost of the equipment, consumables and maintenance in the cost per copy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) The contract is for a period of five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) Disclosure of this information would unreasonably affect the commercial, business or financial affairs of the company concerned. However, the accepted cost per copy was the lowest of those tendered and the whole offer made by Canon Australia represented the best value for money for the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f) There is only one supplier under the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) 923 new copiers and 350 refurbished copiers were provided by Canon Australia. The Department pays for each copy produced on the equipment. No equipment has been purchased under the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) The cost of the equipment is amortised over a Guaranteed Minimum Number of photocopies and the contractor is paid on the basis of copies produced. The $13,950,000 figure notified in the "Commonwealth Purchasing and Disposals Gazette" is the amount the Department is committed to pay in return for the provision of national photocopying services for a period of five years. Under the terms and conditions of the contract, any photocopies produced by DEET above 60 million copies per annum will be charged at approximately one cent each. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii) Three models of new Canon copiers were provided to the department&mdash;the 30 copies per minute (cpm) NP6030, the 50 cpm NP6650ii and the 60 cpm NP6060, as well as refurbished copiers to be used as contingency equipment and to provide some limited photocopying facilities to DEET clients.</PARA>

The copiers provided by Canon do not appear on this list. However, that common use contract states that the overriding consideration in selection of copiers should be to obtain a copier that suits the needs of the user. All copiers selected by the Department were considered to be those best suited to the department's needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NP6030, which incorporates new technology and comprises over half of the new equipment provided under the contract, was not released when Buyers Guide BG99 was issued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(h) The Department examined its use of photocopying facilities over the period June 1993 to March 1994. After examining all available options, it was determined that disposal of existing copiers and the introduction of a national click charge agreement would result in increased efficiency and economy. The Department believes that substantial savings will be realised through the introduction of the national photocopier contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) Tenders were called on 27 June 1994 by advertisement in national newspapers and in the "Commonwealth of Australia Purchasing and Disposals Gazette."

The proposal involves the location of up to 12 Super Puma helicopters and about 500 personnel (including dependants) at Oakey.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) A golf buggy was purchased for use in the Materiel Support section in HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns</EMPHASIS> in January 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The type of golf buggy purchased is a Yamaha G9-EC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The purpose of this purchase is to assist in providing logistics, administrative and maintenance support to 12 naval vessels and Defence units at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns</EMPHASIS>. The Materiel Support section at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns</EMPHASIS> provides direct stores support for some 25,000 line items of stores ranging from equipment-related spares to food items. The golf cart, in its modified form with a carry tray, was purchased as a forward supply vehicle to provide a more efficient method of transporting a range of items, particularly larger ones, to the customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The total cost was $9075.00.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) The motorised buggy was purchased from Yamaha Motor Australia Pty Ltd, 30 Johnston Street, Bulimba, Queensland, 4171.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) The vehicle was not intended, and will not be made available, for use on any golf course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f) The vehicle was purchased as a supply vehicle and specifically configured as a utility to carry stores items. Small trolleys can also be towed by the cart. Prior to purchase of the vehicle, stores were moved to and from the Materiel Support section to the wharf and other areas on flat-top trolleys that were pulled by stores personnel, in `cart-horse' fashion. The manual method was not considered an efficient utilisation of staff, nor was it efficient in the movement of stores, as items were often damaged in transit when trolleys were dragged over the cable hump on the wharf, causing items to fall off. The efficiencies are readily apparent in that average daily time to deliver stores to four alongside vessels has been reduced from one hour to approximately 20 minutes. The following points are also relevant:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) A recently received report relating to a COMCARE Occupational Health and Safety audit, which was conducted late in 1994, stated that "the use of trolleys to man handle stores was not a recommended practice and that alternatives should be sought."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Access to vessels via the wharf is very restricted, due to its width and shape. The wharf is very busy and provides access to 12 attached vessels for food/stores delivery vehicles, fuel delivery/removal trucks, wet sullage removal trucks, the vehicles of visiting maintenance contractors and emergency vehicles. The acquisition of the golf cart facilitates the efficient movement of stores to customers without exacerbating problems associated with congestion.</PARA>
