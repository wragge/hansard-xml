<PARA>The 10 Terminal Regiment transfers cargo and troops from one mode of transport to another at sea, road and rail terminals. The Army Maritime School trains defence personnel in the seamen operated terminal and fitter marine trades. The combined unit will consist of 180 regular soldiers with 170 general reserve soldiers. The two units are currently dispersed over four sites in Sydney. Relocation will improve training opportunities and reduce administrative costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relocation of 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School to one site will save some $3 million in annual operating costs. The relocation will also provide increased training opportunities and locate the unit closer to its primary user&mdash;that is, the 3rd Brigade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 18 September 1995 recommending the project at an estimated cost of $25.9 million. The Department of Defence has noted the committee's recommendation: namely, to advise the committee of the results of the environmental assessment of the project being conducted by the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency and to continue the public consultation process during the detailed design and construction phases of the project. Works are planned to commence upon approval with construction completed by the middle of 1998. I thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This relocation of 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School may very well save $3 million a year in running costs but, as the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) pointed out, it will cost $25 million. The government plans to recoup this $25 million by selling land on Middle Head.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The move to Townsville, according to the Public Works Committee report, is `justified by the need to rationalise land-holdings'. In other words, this whole move is not justified by defence reasons; it is justified by budgetary reasons. This is a money making exercise rather than a defence exercise because, as we well know from previous bitter experience with this government, rationalisation is simply a code for selling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very telling passage in the Public Works Committee report states that this move will generate `enough revenue to more than cover the cost of this project'. In other words, the sites at Middle Head, Georges Heights and Woolwich, which are currently occupied by 10 Terminal Regiment, are going to be put on the market for the highest possible bidder in order to cover this government's budgetary black hole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sacred sites of the people of Sydney. These are the last unspoilt headlands in Sydney Harbour, and this government is going to sacrifice them on the altar of its budgetary difficulties. Future generations will condemn this government if it is allowed to get away with this despicable move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Sydney, the people of Mosman, the people of my electorate, are faced with the spectre of Mirage Middle Head. It is more than simply that; the fact that something like this is happening shows the debasement of governmental process under the gentlemen opposite. Here we see a new and strange principle of government: namely, that the military must pay themselves for any move they seek to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government, and enshrined by this move, we have a pay as you go army&mdash;an army which has to live off the land. I ask: what would happen if, for instance, the Office of the Status of Women had to justify and pay for its move by selling its land-holdings? Of course there would be an absolute uproar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this is not something relatively new, and some would argue peripheral, to the real function of government. This is the basic fundamental function of government: to protect the nation from such external enemies. The army is the most essential thing that any government runs. This government is saying that the Australian Army must operate on a pay as you go basis, that the Australian Army must live off its own land. It is a strangely medieval principle. In those days it used to be called the right of pillage. This government has brought this back to life in a bizarre permutation of the user-pays concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government you have to pay for the roads that you drive on, you have to pay to go to government schools and soon you will have to pay to watch television. The poor old army has to pay to make any move that it deems necessary. The fact of the matter is that this is a disgrace. It is a bad move and it is an even worse principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition policy on this matter is quite clear. As enunciated by Senator Newman, the coalition's policy is that any move by the army must be justified for operational and not budgetary reasons. I say to members opposite: stop playing games with the people of Mosman, stop playing games with the people of Sydney and leave 10 Terminal Regiment where it is. If you have to move it, accept the principle that public land should stay in public hands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) has just said that this move should be justified on operational grounds. It has been. Surely it seems more logical to have the maritime part of the army in the part of Australia where those they work with are situated. What happens now is that when the army has exercises&mdash;and most of their exercises are off Townsville&mdash;they have to go to Townsville by road and sea at a cost of millions of dollars a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is much better for operational reasons to locate them where the main group they work with are. That is the reason for the transfer from Sydney&mdash;a lot of good the maritime services are in the middle of the city&mdash;to Townsville. By doing this, we will save over $3 million a year. I thought that members of the opposition, who are very concerned about saving money, would be interested in saving $3 million a year. I am happy to arrange for the honourable member, when we are there again in about a month for another movement&mdash;and I have already discussed this with him&mdash;to come with us on our tour of inspection. I am more than happy to arrange for him to talk to the defence personnel before that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that we are not going to sell off that land. If I represented that area, I would share his concern about this land being sold off. It is my understanding from inquiries I have made and from evidence we have received at our hearings&mdash;I am not a minister, so I cannot give a definitive answer&mdash;that it is not going to be sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to members the point we stressed at our hearings. The purpose of transferring this unit from Middle Head to Townsville is an operational requirement to bring that part of Australia's forces to where those they work with are, and that is in Townsville. Even if they were going to work with the people from Holsworthy that would still involve a distance. Most of their work is with the forces we already have in Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We looked at six other sites including Darwin, Mackay and Brisbane. On all the evidence it was found that the best site was Townsville. It will save the taxpayers of Australia $3 million a year&mdash;not an inconsiderable sum of money. The whole purpose of the move is operational. I am more than happy to debate this with the shadow minister for defence. I am sure that the shadow minister for defence would agree that, for operational reasons, Townsville is the best possible location for this unit of the Australian Army. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No matter how the lily is gilded, the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill is a result of public pressure since the third runway opened and the coming election. It is also clearly a response on behalf of the government to the private member's bill of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), who simply got in first. Both bills, and virtually all of the debate, are examples of what could be called the `Easton petition syndrome'&mdash;a common disease which attempts to minimise the responsibility when things go wrong, transfer blame to someone else and seek political advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, the spectacle of government and opposition speakers blaming one another for the disaster of the third runway is sickening to the Sydney public. The truth is that the Federal Labor Party gave in to airline interests in the 1940s in establishing an international airport at Mascot. Even then the evidence was clear that the site was unsuitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1951 on the coalition has consistently supported the airport expansion irrespective of its recent hypocritical Damascus experience. Indeed, in only 1993 the coalition flirted with the removal of the curfew altogether. Any credit resulting from Labor's attempt in 1972 to find a new airport site was more than cancelled by its late 1980s reversal and the leasing of terminals to the airlines followed by its decision to go ahead with the third runway&mdash;an approval, I might add, which was only made possible by the collusion of the New South Wales Liberal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only government with even relatively clean hands on this issue was the Wran Labor government, which effectively prevented the construction of the third runway from 1976 to 1988. The Carr Labor government's credentials are yet to be seen but there seems little hope, given its inaction over the last six months. Only the partisan and gullible will be taken in by the arguments of either major party as to who is to blame for the current situation&mdash;both are equally culpable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Make no mistake: the public anger at the betrayal of the residents of Sydney by both major parties will not go away, irrespective of this bill or the installation of any of the election sops proposed so far by the government or the opposition. The level of protest and civil disruption in Sydney is going to escalate as has happened at other airports around the world. Whoever is in government next year will face the spectacle of increasingly angry demonstrations and decent men and women being dragged away by police. They will also be haunted by the catastrophic scenario of a major accident with horrendous loss of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of this bill, the fact is that since the first international flight arrived at Mascot in the 1940s the place has been run to suit the airlines. Since then captive governments have poured in billions in subsidies, assisted by the captive regulatory authorities. From an area about the size of two football fields the airport has steadily gobbled up a large area of Sydney. Huge areas around the airport have been given over to airport related infrastructure. Thousands of homes have been demolished. Now hundreds more will be demolished at Tempe in the near future and thousands more along the flight paths will slowly decay and cease to be livable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to being the worst environmental disaster to befall any large Australian city, over half a billion dollars has now been spent or committed&mdash;more than double the amount the public was told it would cost&mdash;with more to come. It is amazing or perhaps a sign of guilt that no-one has raised the fact that the cost of the third runway has already more than doubled with the proposed expenditure of $260 million of remedial work in a forlorn attempt to ameliorate noise problems. Even this is only the tip of the iceberg. Vastly more will be spent in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major health studies already under way which have not yet been completed will lead to new expenditure and no doubt legal actions. New standards are being set which will have repercussions at airports around Australia and pressures will mount in all expanding urban areas from Broome to Brisbane and eventually in Melbourne. Yet after all this we have a third-rate airport at Sydney which can't even cope with the Olympics. It has no long-term future and has become a massive health hazard to both passengers and residents alike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is almost unbelievable that all of this has been done without any cost-benefit studies which would have shown the massive economic cost and detriment to Sydney in terms of urban consolidation. I can only reiterate yet again that it is testimony to the failure of the two-party system that we have reached the present position, having ignored the long-term economic, social equity and environmental effects of continuing to expand Australia's major airport in the densest part of Australia's largest city and the enormous implications that flow from such an action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems of urban consolidation and minimising the sprawl of Sydney and other major cities have been well recognised since the 1960s. While both state and federal governments have preached ad nauseam about the need to stop urban sprawl for almost 20 years they have achieved little by their ineffective developer-driven solutions of attempting to force high density housing on an unwilling community while having no transport and land use policy and no policy of conservation of residential land, which are the only effective answers to urban consolidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has not been recognised in the urban consolidation debate is the economic, social and environmental effects of Kingsford Smith airport, burgeoning since 1945 like a black hole, absorbing housing, attracting motor vehicle traffic, breaking down the urban environment for kilometres around the airport. At every stage in the history of Sydney airport both government and opposition have served the private interest rather than the public interest with decisions made based on the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Virtually nothing said in the debate of this bill by government or opposition suggests that the future will be any different. The Leader of the Opposition's bill to entrench the curfew in legislation&mdash;which is certainly the catalyst for the government's bill in spite of the many denials&mdash;is little more than window-dressing. It does nothing to improve the current situation and allows substantial increase in traffic in the curfew period in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the Leader of the Opposition's consistent support for the expansion of the airport over the last 20 years and his strong support for the construction of the third runway, which was well ventilated at public meetings in his own electorate prior to the runway's construction, his bill cannot be considered as other than unprincipled electoral opportunism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pretence of the opposition that it was misled by the environmental impact statement is patently false and hypocritical. It was clear as a bell what would happen following the third runway construction, as thousands of Sydney residents and even a reading of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> can attest. In fact no-one who looked sensibly at the conclusions of the EIS or the costs believed them&mdash;not even the airlines or the regulatory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's record is even worse given its 12 years of office, the selling out to the airline interests in the late 1980s, the attempted misleading of the public with the third runway environmental impact study in terms of its environmental effects, and the public expenditure. Nevertheless, the government's curfew bill provides the first small reversal of half a century of expansion at Sydney airport, although the restrictions contained in the bill do not go anywhere near far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It certainly does not go anywhere near giving the residents of Sydney any guarantee of a decent night's sleep. It does not deal with the myriad of problems in the curfew hours resulting from he uncontrolled use of light aircraft under 2000 feet, helicopters, and the many propeller-driven aircraft. It also ignores the problem that no curfew exists at Bankstown or other airports in the Sydney region. It is no satisfaction to anyone who cannot sleep because of aircraft noise, despite what type of aircraft it is or what airport it came from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the bill does tighten movements in the shoulder period and tightens exemptions and imposes penalties. But many loopholes still remain and, on the record of the airlines, the regulators and executives of the major parties, there can be little public confidence of any substantial improvement. In spite of many reassuring but ultimately worthless statements over the years no financial penalty has ever been imposed and exemptions have been handed out like confetti. Notwithstanding the assurances of the current Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), it is unrealistic not to expect that the airlines will fully exploit, and be permitted to exploit, all the loopholes in the future, as they have done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation does at least, for the first time, allow for the provision of information to the public and at least establishes some framework for public consultations and, as such, the people of Sydney should be grateful for small mercies. In broad effect, however, the bill has only marginal benefits, as have other remedial measures that the government is implementing or talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Measures such as the insulation of 4,200 homes have minor benefits for a handful of those affected by noise in Sydney but introduce new problems of fire, airconditioning, and confining people to their homes. It leaves many thousands of other properties with no redress, a degraded environment and substantial losses of property value. In many cases their homes are their only financial asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Acquisition of a handful of residences goes some way to compensating some of the residents who are now subject to impossible noise conditions immediately adjacent to the airport but it is a tragic irony, when state and federal governments have been talking urban consolidation in Sydney for over 20 years, that now the federal government is demolishing homes and reducing low income accommodation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some reward for the `true believers'!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's suggestion of a cap on total movements at the airport is again to be welcomed. However, in the face of the reality of a 25 per cent increase in jet movements to the north when the new control tower comes into operation in the near future, you can forgive Sydney residents for being cynical. The proposal of reopening the east-west runway is certainly something which most residents of Sydney want, on the basis that it would share the noise more equitably. But given that the advantage would be only temporary at best, with the relentless increase in air traffic and the strong possibilities that it is likely to be manipulated to increase air traffic to the north, as the airlines have already signalled, it is obviously no long-term solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many arguments have been canvassed on safety aspects of reopening the east-west runway, and the opposition's position must be treated with some scepticism in the face of its record of consistently supporting airport expansion. The likelihood of a future coalition Minister for Transport carrying the personal responsibility for accidents at the airport is really stretching credibility. Almost certainly, the use of the east-west runway would be watered down to cater mainly for general aviation and regional airlines and would result in increased north-south heavy jet movements together with an increase in the overall airport capacity. Nevertheless, a reopening of the east-west runway is desirable if it can be achieved, properly managed and does not result in additional growth of air traffic. But it is certainly no panacea. It is of marginal benefit, as are the various suggested improvements in flight paths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underlying this bill and almost everything that has been said in the House by government and opposition speakers is the brutal acceptance that a few thousand people at Kurnell can be sacrificed to minimise electoral fallout for the rest of Sydney. Every speaker in this debate seems to think no-one lives south of the airport. In spite of the impassioned hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition of sharing the noise, everyone seems to be satisfied, like `good Germans', to virtually exterminate the residents of Kurnell in a futile attempt to curry electoral favour with the vastly greater numbers of voters north, east and west of the airport. Just as the third runway meant a dramatic increase in noise to the north of the airport, this bill heralds a literal nightmare for Kurnell residents. Suggestions of confining flight paths to the Cronulla sandhills and the heads of Botany Bay or that southbound planes euphemistically go `out to sea' are a cruel attempt at deception which will certainly not fool anyone at Kurnell at least. The truth is that no matter how you twist and dive there is no way out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing in this bill, or anything that has been said in this House by the major parties, addresses the main issues of Sydney airport in any substantial way. No amount of marginal amelioration on scheduling, flight paths, the curfew or runway usage will have any real effect on the noise and environmental problems of Sydney airport. Neither will it have any effect in stopping the economic and environmental haemorrhaging of Sydney in respect of the urban consolidation effects of the airport. These costs, which have never even been considered, would make the cost of a new airport and the required infrastructure almost insignificant. No amount of marginal tinkering will alter the fact that Sydney airport will always be a third-rate airport on its present site and continue to be a major economic handicap to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's air services in the future can never be properly satisfied at Kingsford Smith or even with Badgerys Creek as an overflow airport. The disadvantages of dual airports are well known. The major airlines will never leave Kingsford Smith unless they are forced to and will continue relentless expansion on that site. The only effective long-term solution now possible is the development of Badgerys Creek as a replacement airport and the phasing out of Kingsford Smith over the next 15 years. A site for a new airport completely outside any future Sydney conurbation must also be found if the history of Kingsford Smith is not to repeat itself at Badgerys Creek. The last 50 years of airport planning has been an unmitigated failure in Sydney at least. Surely, now that this fact is almost universally accepted, except by those trying to justify their past involvement, we can plan for the next 50 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, that is doubtless a forlorn hope, given the virtual impossibility for decisions to be made in the rigid two-party system of government except on the basis of short-term partisan advantage. This is the fundamental reason why the collective decision making of a succession of individually intelligent people over many years has brought us to our present disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition's threat to block privatisation until the east-west runway is re-opened and the noise problems of the airport are solved can be criticised on many grounds. At best it offers only temporary relief and attempts to raise false public expectations. It does however offer the government an opportunity to back away from privatisation which can only compound all the present problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Kingsford Smith is privatised there is no hope for any real solution in the long-term future. The residents of Sydney will have no alternative but to mount a campaign of such ferocity as to deter any intending purchaser.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one point the Leader of the Opposition is absolutely correct. No privatisation should take place in the face of the present problems. Where he is wrong is holding out any suggestion that the problems of Kingsford Smith can ever be satisfactorily resolved by the re-opening of the east-west runway or other virtual placebos. Certainly every possible amelioration should be pursued in the short term but the fundamental problems cannot be solved except by redevelopment of the site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Privatisation of Badgerys Creek would at least have the virtue of making the redevelopment much more attractive in principle. Of course, such a proposal will be anathema to the current airline interests who hold a virtual monopoly for the next 30 years or so thanks to one of former Prime Minister Hawke's deals at Kirribilli House in the late 1980s. It will also be anathema to the many countless bureaucrats and indeed members of this House who have been part of the problem over the years. It will be resisted by a few thousand regular airline users and staff of Sydney airport who take a selfish short-term view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet no-one who looks at the broader view of Sydney as a whole and the economic efficiency of Australia's airlines into the future could deny the need to at least carry a comprehensive cost-benefit study into the redevelopment of Sydney airport and its environs housing some 200,000 people at relatively low density and the construction of a replacement airport at Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing of public value can be achieved by the continuation of mutual partisan vilification and divisively attempting to set residents of various parts of Sydney against one another. The present Minister for Transport was an undeniable major factor in the demise of the state Labor government in 1988.

I can only urge the minister to at least examine this constructive proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), I believe Mascot not only is ideally located but also is one of the best airport sites for any capital city anywhere in the world. I regard the present legislation and the over-reactions of people in Sydney largely to be the product of mismanagement and mishandling by the present Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who I regard as inept, incompetent and deliberately abusing his power and prerogatives in a way which I believe is objectionable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sydney airport has several prime functions. Without doubt, the growth of the city and the growth of passenger travel into Australia, both tourist and business, depend very much on an ability to handle a large number of people safely, in all weathers, without delays in approach to Sydney airport and in such a way that, of course, the people around Sydney are subjected to no more noise than is absolutely essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is the result of the government, yet again, playing catch-up politics. As in so many other areas, they have tried to rely on beating people around the ears instead of trying to find constructive and positive solutions. Again, unlike the member for North Sydney, I do not believe Badgerys Creek or its accelerated development in any way will provide an answer to Sydney's traffic problems as far as air movements are concerned. Badgerys Creek is situated in one of the most rapidly growing areas of Sydney. The population there, without doubt, will become quite intensely concentrated in future times.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only that, but because of Mascot's proximity to the coast it is possible for about 50 per cent of all landings on the so-called north-south runways to be over water. Over Badgerys Creek, every landing and every take-off has to be over land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe the hilly terrain, the infrastructure that is necessary to provide access to Badgerys Creek, the distance from the centre of the city, any more than the fact that it is over that rapidly growing outer suburban area of the city, make Badgerys Creek a suitable site for the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all these reasons, therefore, I see restrictions being imposed not only on Mascot but also on the proposed development at Badgerys Creek as an inadequate solution to what are recognised as future major traffic problems. There are other aspects I should identify, too, when talking about the problems of Mascot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, representing country New South Wales, I find quite unacceptable any suggestion that there should be undue political inhibitions placed on access to and from Mascot. Mascot, of course, is the desirable venue for people seeking to come to Sydney from intrastate for business, pleasure or family reasons. To suggest, should Badgerys Creek be developed, that it would in some way be an alternative is absolute rubbish. Badgerys Creek is miles away. It takes away the advantage of being able to get into Sydney in the morning and leave again at night. If you keep people coming in and out of Sydney, it avoids some of that traffic movement that is an undoubted problem in Sydney itself. When you have people moving in and out of Mascot, you at least avoid having people using the roads quite as much, to the disadvantage of other residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concerns really revolve around four areas. The first relates to political interference. I believe the Star system, the new airport take-off and landing schedule, has been developed in a way I believe has prejudiced the noise incidence in significant residential areas of the city. I believe that the support being given by Ansett and Qantas to the maintenance only of the north-south runways and not the east-west runway is based purely on political pressure being applied to them, and for no other reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the whole basis for the movement out to Badgerys Creek, and that area's rapid development, is not an answer but a politically expedient device. I will return in a moment to the whole concept of political involvement which I see as a fundamental problem in any rational discussion of the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem is a physical one. Sydney is Australia's major aircraft destination, and to suggest that disciplines in some way be imposed so it will become more difficult for people to land into and take off from this magnificent Mascot airport site I think is ridiculous. Therefore, we have to find a way to accommodate this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, we need to take account of the impact on residential areas around Sydney. If there are ways by which the level of aircraft noise can be contained, ways in which the noise can be spread so that you can avoid aircraft circulating, avoid aircraft cutting across main residential areas, avoid aircraft having their engines at full throttle or in reverse thrust so that it does not in any way accelerate that noise contamination, of course those things need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth area, which is just as important, is that we have to look at ways in which the facilities we have can be better utilised. It is in this area that I see the answers to many of the present problems. For example, I would like to know why the control tower is not open. I find the political intervention in the process of both the take-off and landing procedures, and also in the way in which aircraft are now being routed around Sydney, not a product of trying to contain the noise problems&mdash;which quite properly the member for North Sydney and others have identified in this debate&mdash;but it is there simply because I think the minister and a few of his colleagues want to keep aircraft from their particular parts of Sydney and relocate them elsewhere. Were they acting on behalf of Australia, they would start by identifying the problem in the broad and by trying to contain the noise level generally, rather than trying to redistribute it in a manner that penalises some and advantages others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, that is the way I see the operation of the standard arrivals system as it now operates. I certainly believe that the closing of the east-west runway has accentuated the traffic flow and the noise problems over particular parts of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time available, let me briefly talk about four issues. These concern me because there seems to be all sorts of ways by which this government has fallen into that typical Labor Right trap of New South Wales of trying to do things for their mates and forgetting about the general interests of the people of our community. I acknowledge totally that there are problems in the way in which international competition has affected the viability of our airlines. I know, for example, that Ansett has had problems, in spite of the preferred position that it has been given in access to airports. The honourable member for North Sydney referred to negotiations that occurred while Prime Minister Hawke was in office. Such negotiations certainly gave them a position in the ownership and operation of their terminals that made it almost impossible for Compass to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at Qantas. Qantas knows that it has been starved of capital by this Labor government. They know that, if they are to be able to compete in what is quite an exciting future for air traffic and air transport around the world, they have to be able to re-equip. They have to have capital in order to re-equip with aircraft that will be able to provide the services desired. They also have to be able to maintain services in a range of destinations or to a range of destinations that will attract sufficient passenger volumes. I believe a number of destinations have been closed by Qantas not on the basis of a rational assessment of potential traffic but on the immediate projection of what the cash flows will be with the capital that they have available. The government has been heavy handing them over privatisation. I totally support the move toward privatisation but it should not be predicating their long-term future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as Qantas is concerned, the government is in the position of saying to them, `Don't you say anything in favour of reopening the east-west runway.' For that reason, and because of the privatisation pressures that have been applied, it is my view that Qantas's view on the reopening of the east-west runway should be totally ignored. I believe it is there for the wrong reasons and because of pressure that has been applied inappropriately. As far as Ansett is concerned, I believe the same argument applies. Let us look at the situation regarding the agreements with Air New Zealand. One can find that political pressure has certainly been the way in which Ansett has been told that Air New Zealand may or may not be allowed to buy into them. In terms of opening our air services with a single aviation market, there has again been an intrusion based peculiarly on a political basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a debate in the New Zealand parliament, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. David Caygill, said that the New Zealand government's actions `had been inconsistent and weak, and had given Australia the impression that New Zealand was powerless'. Prime Minister Bolger replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the government had not engaged in knee-jerk reactions; it had not, as some in the Labor Party suggested it should do, thrown out the Australian airline, Ansett New Zealand, in retaliation. It was absurd to suggest putting up the barriers again.</PARA>
<PARA>Prime Minister Bolger continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real reason for the withdrawal was not a failure of New Zealand to honour the undertakings of the memorandum of understanding: the Australian Minister of Transport had said it all when he said that the understanding on a single aviation market was affecting the Australian Labor government's proposal to float the Qantas airline.</PARA>
<PARA>Ansett was very concerned about its position in terms of arrangements with Air New Zealand and they were in the same position as Qantas because of privatisation and the federal government being able to heavy hand them. In my view, those are the only reasons that both Qantas and Ansett did not come out in support of the call&mdash;and full marks to Hazelton Airlines for putting this view&mdash;that the east-west runway be opened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the why, where, how and what of the traffic flow, you have to understand that there is not just the need to reopen the east-west runway and to spread the traffic; there is also the matter of the height in which aircraft are now directed because of this operation of standard arrivals system. Also, there is a significant redirection of aircraft at heights of movement which I do not believe minimise noise in the way that they could. If one looks at the influence of politicians&mdash;politicians from the Labor Party and, in particular, the minister&mdash;at opening and improving Sydney airport, one has to accept that an honest and rational approach has not been given to the issue. I believe that is very much to the disadvantage of those people whose homes are under the flight paths and who are prejudiced by increasing airport noise. What we have to do is ask a few significant questions. Why has there been no increase in air movements? Why does the minister continually refer to simultaneous operations when there are no simultaneous operations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In every other major airport across Australia, east-west and north-south runways in virtually similar relativity to those at Mascot operate quite satisfactorily&mdash;at Tullamarine, at Brisbane, at Perth and at Adelaide&mdash;and no complaints are lodged. Why? Because there is no political intervention in the way there is at Mascot. There is a way in which you can significantly increase traffic movements at Mascot without disadvantaging the residents around Sydney and flights would not be delayed the way they are now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell you, as somebody who flies in and out of Sydney all the time, that there is hardly ever an air traffic movement that is not delayed on the way into Sydney airport, even when a prior landing slot has been given. In my view, landing slots have nothing to do with aircraft noise; they are all about maladministration of the airport. What concerns me is that there is an entirely wrong approach and answer being given by the minister, who is suggesting that in some way simultaneous operations are dangerous. At the moment, with the take-off and landing pattern, because planes are using the parallel runway they do not cross on the ground but they cross in the air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of traffic movement into Sydney is no less dangerous in the air than it is on the ground. I believe that again it is a matter of political interference rather than any pragmatic and practical understanding of the real way in which you can best contain aircraft movements with efficiency, expedite aircraft movements without aggravating the noise problem, and move and allocate traffic patterns to aircraft without in any way prejudicing the noise problems which rightly are the concern of all those who live around that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to have a look at a number of other problems as far as the operations of the political intervention are concerned. I do not know whether, when we get the new radar in November, there is going to be, as the member for North Sydney suggests, a 25 per cent increase in traffic to the north. If there is, it needs to be spread. That is one of the reasons the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has introduced the bill he has and has been advocating, as we all do and as he does in the amendments to be moved to the legislation, the re-opening of the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are not going to be able to achieve, through the political manipulation of traffic flows, the containment of air noise. That is the fundamental problem in this whole question and until we get to a straight and reasonable application of the technology that is now available, a technology of utilising the slots so that traffic flies straight into Sydney, minimising the distance flown, you are not going to be able to efficiently use what is a prime located airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned a little about Badgerys Creek. I understand and recognise that at some stage a second airport is going to be necessary for Sydney. I do not accept that the surveys in any way demonstrate that Badgerys Creek is a prime location. Of course, with the Olympics 2000 coming up, there is a feeling that something has got to be done in order to meet the increased traffic flow. But Badgerys Creek still has far more disadvantages in the long term than it has advantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of that part of Sydney are going to be far more subject to aircraft noise than they expect. The increased traffic flow from the new infrastructures, essential to move people and freight from that airport, is going to be a further disadvantage. It is yet another example of the way political interference has disrupted what could be a rational and reasonable development of the Sydney metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that at the moment more movements per hour could be achieved at Mascot throughout the day and I believe that the curfew needs to be applied, as this legislation suggests, but needs to be applied having in mind that you cannot succeed in promoting the growth of traffic into Sydney unless you do something about allowing more traffic movements through the day. Nothing at the moment can be seen as achieving that, under the present minister's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to know why aircraft cannot operate east of the airport. There are very few traffic movements and traffic turns in a line between the coast and straight into the north-south runway. There are, on the other hand, many to the west of the airport. I see absolutely no reason why that cannot be changed. I certainly do not follow why there is more holding at Mascot than at any other international airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these questions are matters where the political involvement of the minister and the government have been to the disadvantage of people in Sydney. There is no doubt that the environmental haemorrhaging on which several members have commented is more a product of politics than it is of proper management. Mascot is a primely located airport. Mascot is a facility which has enabled Sydney to grow. It was because of the advantages of Mascot to a large degree that the Olympic bid was successful. Now there is to be even more political intervention because the minister refuses to open the tower. The minister seems to be determined to maintain through Stars, the operation of standard arrivals, a flight plan which I believe contributes to noise, not relieves it. The minister is determined that the east-west runway will not operate. The minister is determined that aircraft will not operate east of the airport. I believe these are all disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly support the amendments which are to be moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I believe the government yet again has been shown to exploit its numbers in this place and its power base within the business world and is totally neglecting the reasonable needs of the residents of the city of Sydney. Sydney will not be able to grow, if Sydney is to continue to be the commercial hub of Asia, none of those things will be possible without efficient economic access through Mascot. It is not possible by the present political steps being used by this Labor government to see the advances that could otherwise be possible. I very strongly support the foreshadowed amendments and the additional legislation introduced by the Leader of the Opposition and believe that the minister needs to withdraw his sticky fingers from what I see as an absolute mess in the administration of this department. The sooner he does so the better chance there will be of the resolution of the traffic flow problems and the noise contamination about which all of us are concerned. </PARA>

He wants to cut its efficiency virtually in half to pick up a few votes in his own seat, which he has won reasonably comfortably since he came here in 1974. It is not as if there are five or six seats sitting around the airport and you can say, `There is a bit of low rent politics here.' This is so low you would need a pair of binoculars to find it. This is about a handful of votes in Bennelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what does the Leader of the Opposition say?

This is what he was saying through these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government takes the decision, squibbed by so many others, at the urging of the then coalition state government under Premier Greiner in New South Wales. It builds the runway under budget and under time and then puts into place the most ambitious, in world terms, noise abatement program anywhere. Not only that, it has forced aircraft to take aircraft patterns which minimise the damage and noise to the surrounding communities. But I know and John Howard knows that if we seek to try to have traffic on the east-west runway across two parallel runways the result will be a dramatic collision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was always known. The problems at Mascot airport were always known. While ever we had intersecting runways, we were always in the cart for a major collision. We nearly had one not so many years ago. Not only did the incoming plane nearly clean up one on the cross-wind runway; it also nearly took out one waiting to take off. We nearly had three aircraft all rolled into one in what would have been probably the worst accident in Australian airline history and probably in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot remember a time in the last 20 or 30 years when three major aircraft have been involved in such a collision.

We now have less than 18 crew, on average, on Australian ships. It was 28 a few years ago. He wants to convince the business community that he will go for these big micro-economic changes. But on one he has actually supported, one that is actually built, one that has substantially lifted the capacity of Mascot airport and one that has lifted safety enormously what does he want to do? He wants to open the east-west runway, which will introduce a major safety factor. At the same time, in the doing of this, he will tug away at what is without a shred of hyperbole the greatest micro-economic change to the state of New South Wales in the last 20 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the same tragedy you are now trying to bring on. As the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) is passing notes around the place, let me read what he had to say in 1991:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any further delay in deciding on a third runway for Mascot could mean loss of life as well as economic insanity. With Mascot now operating at near maximum capacity, and air traffic controllers bending over backwards to extract maximum efficiency out of our present archaic runway set-up, the risk factor must be greatly increased.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the very archaic runway set-up they now wish to go back to. Listen to this. On 10 September 1991 their former tourism spokesman, Mr Jull:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . renewed his call for the third runway project to commence following an aborted Qantas 747 landing. While not wishing to overdramatise the incident he said, `It follows hard on the heels of a potential disaster involving a Thai jet last month. In light of this, it is impossible to understand why the Government is dragging the chain over the third runway. Increasing concerns over air safety and continuing delays at the airport make the immediate commencement of the project even more urgent.'</PARA>
<PARA>Can you believe these people? Can you believe they brought this bill in for these tawdry political motives after saying these things so unambiguously and with such clarity? This is the daddy of all Howard quotes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean their&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is our, the government's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">refusal to build the third runway over the last 6 1/2 years has been based on their assessment of the politics of it. I mean their right wing numbers men openly boast that they're not going to be so stupid as to build a third runway and lose all those seats in Sydney. I have always regarded that argument incidentally as nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA>Listen to this. John Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I grew up under the flight path in the St George area of Sydney and know something about the politics of that area, and I've always regarded the issue as being grossly exaggerated in terms of the impact on local residents. There are a limited number of people who are severely affected by aircraft noise. The great bulk of the rest of them are only mildly affected. In any event, they bought their houses knowing full well that they were under flight paths. In any event, there are many sections of my electorate in areas such as Lane Cove and Hunters Hill who have just as much aircraft noise and areas frequently under flight paths as people living near the airport.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said. If you want an example of a complete lack of principle, a complete duplicity and complete dishonesty of purpose and dishonesty of motive, you have seen it in the Leader of the Opposition's bill and his threat to abort the important sale of important public assets in the form of the FAC assets, with the principal one being the Kingsford Smith airport.

He is sneaky because he is now trying to pretend that he is really about trying to abate aircraft noise when in the past he has said they were exaggerated claims. He is weak and sneaky but, worse than that, he is into vandalism as well. The vandalism is that he wants to put a spear in $2 billion of the budget's figuring, simply because if he stamps his foot in the House of Representatives he does not hear the ricochet in the Senate. So he is going to try to beat up on the budget by knocking out the Kingsford Smith airport.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is fond of talking about headland performances. This performance of his has been about a particular headland that runs from Hunters Hill to Woolwich smack bang in the middle of his own electorate of Bennelong. This has been the headland performance to end all headland performances where the opposition would sell out, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said, every principle of economic management and every principle of financial probity. Why? For the burghers of Hunters Hill and the burghers of Woolwich to prop up his own 3.5 per cent margin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing so, he runs against every single piece of expert advice that has ever been made available, and he has not a scrap of substance to put against that expert advice. I first came into this House last year and indicated the advice of the Civil Aviation Authority, which was in very firm terms. The advice stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CAA reaffirmed its position that, on safety grounds, it strongly advises against the use of the east-west runway in intersecting operations with the parallel north-south runway system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This position is based on the following considerations:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been accepted internationally that parallel runway operations are an improvement in safety over intersecting operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More complex three runway configuration operations would increase workload and complexity for air traffic controllers and pilots, with conflicting traffic patterns both on the ground and in the air.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large number of aircraft would need to cross the active east-west runway to position for take-off on the parallel runways, or taxiing to the terminals after landing. It is estimated that aircraft would be expected to cross the east-west runway every 45 seconds or less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the use of the intersecting east-west runway, the required safety corridors to accommodate aircraft carrying out missed approaches could not readily be provided.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the advice of the Civil Aviation Authority then. At the time the opposition said, `Oh well, they're discredited anyway. They've got a dreadful reputation.' A few things have happened since then. I think that was very sound advice and it is advice that has been reaffirmed by Airservices Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airservices Australia&mdash;the body that replaced the Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;gave written advice dated 14 August 1995 formally reaffirming the position that, while parallel runways are available at Sydney airport, Airservices Australia itself, with its statutory responsibilities for safety, `would not be prepared to restore simultaneous independent runway operations involving the use of the east-west runway in intersecting operations with the parallel north-south runway system'. There is the new body that replaced the Civil Aviation Authority saying, `For God's sake, don't do it on safety grounds.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of the other body that was set up to manage air safety&mdash;the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. That authority has new leadership and comprises the world's best expertise. It has a new charter principally charged with policing safety. What did it have to say? It had a lot to say. On 3 August 1995, it indicated in a written statement that simultaneous runway operations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is an air traffic control procedure which permits simultaneous landings and take-off of aeroplanes on intersecting runways. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>these are the safety experts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is of the view that the restoration of Simops procedures at Sydney airport while parallel runways are available would be less safe than the current parallel runway system in operation.</PARA>
<PARA>So there are two principal pieces of advice reaffirming the earlier advice from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The opposition have come into this House and spoken about evidence before the Senate committee. Let us go to the operators themselves and see what they had to say. They not only gave evidence before the Senate committee but also felt obliged to put out their own press release. They quoted from their evidence in response to Senator Parer. I refer to the press release of the Civil Air Operations Officers Association&mdash;that is, the air traffic controllers. Their president quoted his response in the Senate to a question from Senator Parer, the chair, who asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are you suggesting that cross-runway operations are not safe or just less safe?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Lorschy replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are less safe.</PARA>
<PARA>So here we have the Civil Aviation Authority, Airservices Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the air traffic controllers themselves. Who comes along next? Qantas comes along next, with Ansett. What do they have to say? They have gone to print&mdash;they have made their position clear&mdash;with a joint statement from the managing director of Qantas and the managing director of Ansett. They said that their operational experts&mdash;that is, the experts of the airlines themselves&mdash;regarded the parallel runways as `inherently more safe and efficient than intersecting runways'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They went on to quote the absolute necessity of this airport operating at between 80 and 85 take-offs and landings per hour&mdash;because that is what it needs to do to meet the needs of Sydney. They indicated what happens if you return to the bad old days. They gave the figures in their press release&mdash;that is, without Simops, there would be 44 to 48 movements per hour on those intersecting runways and, with Simops, the best they ever got was 55 to 60 movements but with less safety. This is after $250 million has been spent developing a first-class runway system which is more safe and gives you 80 to 85 take-offs and landings per hour&mdash;landings that are needed for all the tourists coming to Australia, for all the domestic passengers in Australia and for all the rural air travellers who need access to Sydney. That great demand that the airport faces each day has led to the delays that have ricocheted through the whole air traffic system of Australia, and has finally been overcome with a system that will provide 80 to 85 take-offs and landings per hour, supplemented by Badgerys Creek, the new development at Sydney West airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what Mr Strong and Mr McMahon said: `We accept the advice from the regulatory authorities.' Those gentlemen accept the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Airservices Australia and the air traffic controllers. Qantas and Ansett accept the advice. The opposition, of course, says that it does not believe it. The opposition believes that its views on safety are more important. On behalf of those two great airlines, these two gentlemen said that they accepted the advice from the regulatory authorities and from their own technical experts that safety and efficiency would be diminished by permanent reopening of the east-west runway. Those two gentlemen say that the key point is that intersecting runways are inherently less safe and less efficient. Those are very strong views from the people who are best able to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They said that the industry could not support the opposition's proposal, which experts believe will cut capacity and cause unnecessary delays not only to Sydney travellers but also to those using the whole of the national network. But, of course, when there are a few lousy votes in the electorate of Bennelong, and when the Leader of the Opposition's own neck is on the line, all the credentials go out the window. He is prepared to come into this House and say that if he is ever elected he will overturn all that advice and return to a less safe and less efficient mode of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has made it very clear in this debate that he is going to put jets on the east-west runway. He said that it is going to be intercepting with jets. It is that which brings the capacity down. If it is not intercepting with jets, the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) knows what it is: it is pulling the propeller driven planes out of the jet stream and raising the capacity of the airport from 85 to 95 landings per hour with 10 more jumbos coming down the north-south access, because they would eliminate 10 small planes which travel much more slowly and prevent those 10 jumbos from landing at the moment. The member for Bennelong says no, that is not what he is going to do. He said he will reopen the east-west runway for jet operations. He says that he is not about the 10 extra jumbos. Pigs he isn't! He will not admit it to his own electors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of this debate the opposition has said that such operations are working quite well overseas, and it bases its whole case on what it says is better evidence than that coming from those bodies that I have just mentioned. The first piece of evidence is from a body called US Consultants Flight Transportation Associates. I have had a look at the report from that body. The House needs to be aware that the claim that use of the three runways in concert is safe and allows greater capacity is far from the findings to be found in the report. In fact, that is not what the report finds at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report was prepared in 1989 as a theoretical computer modelling exercise of capacity options at the airport. That was its purpose. In no way does it represent a detailed analysis of operational or safety issues. It does not go to those things at all. We have only to look at the introduction to the report to see that it is no evidence at all. This is the introduction that the opposition never refers to and which it has never put around the press gallery. The report says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capacity of the airport under existing conditions and under a number of hypothetical future alternatives has been estimated. It should be emphasised that examination of a hypothetical alternative does not imply that this scenario has been deemed to be feasible with respect to engineering, economic, environmental, statutory or other aspects.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the qualification in the very report that the opposition relies upon to say, `Oh no, believe us because we are able to quote the US consultants, Flight Transportation Associates.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing the opposition relies upon is the claim that intersecting runways are operating on a similar basis at major overseas airports. They gave the example of Heathrow. There is no such thing in Australia; there is no comparison. There is no comparison internationally either. Let me go through the examples they have given. They spoke in this debate about the parallel operations at Heathrow airport. While there are two parallel runways and one intersecting cross-runway at Heathrow, the cross-runway is only used when there are excessive cross-winds on the parallels&mdash;the same as KSA at this very moment. What was the amount of traffic on the cross-runway last year? It was 1.4 per cent of movements at Heathrow. So that one is out the window. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next big example given was Los Angeles. They said that there is a similar situation at Los Angeles which works perfectly well. There is no similar situation at Los Angeles, because there are no cross-runways at Los Angeles. At Los Angeles there are four parallel runways, not a cross-runway configuration. So they are wrong again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then they quoted Copenhagen, where they said there were two parallel runways and an intersecting cross-runway. But the experts will tell you that the parallels there do not work with Simops. The cross-runway at Copenhagen is restricted to small planes under 11,000 kilograms&mdash;no major planes at all. Nine per cent of the movements at that airport are those small planes on the cross-runway&mdash;exactly what you have ruled out by saying that you want to put jets on the cross-runway. So the example of Copenhagen goes out the door. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last example was San Francisco. The opposition said that San Francisco had the same thing, but it is not the same thing. There are not three but four runways at San Francisco. There are two sets of parallels. They do not use Simops either. There are no intersecting operations of jets on those runways whatsoever. They do not intersect. The arrangements at San Francisco are not in any way similar to Kingsford Smith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kingsford Smith is an airport under great pressure. It is an airport vital to the interests of airports all around Australia&mdash;to the travelling public, to tourism and to investment in this country. Never in the 25 years as an elected representative in one parliament or another have I heard irresponsibility of the order of that of the Leader of the Opposition yesterday when he said that he was going to hold up the airport privatisation bill if he could not get his way for his constituents&mdash;those burghers of the headland at Hunters Hill.</PARA>

At the moment, a multimillion dollar development of Adelaide airport is on the line as well, because that is to be funded from the leasing process. I'll bet you haven't told Dean Brown what you have done to him. I'll bet you didn't tell his office when you were telling porkies to Jeff Kennett's office&mdash;because this blows out the Adelaide airport extension by another 12 months. </PARA>

<PARA>I welcome the opportunity of moving this amendment. It is, of course, the amendment which is going to put the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) and other people on the spot. It is the amendment to reopen the east-west runway and it affords me the opportunity of saying a few things about the amazing contribution to the debate this morning by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have one message for the Prime Minister: it is about time he made up his mind how he is going to attack me. One day the Prime Minister misleadingly claims that there is going to be a wages explosion under a coalition government. The next day he misleadingly says that I am going to cut wages. One day the Prime Minister says that I am a dangerous economic revolutionary and the next day he says I am a do-nothing troglodyte. The Prime Minister really ought to make up his mind just how he is going to attack me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the specifics of the amendment, I want to deal with a few of the lies that have been peddled by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and by the Prime Minister. The first lie, of course, is that in some way the decision that has been taken by the coalition is going to punch a hole in this year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what you said, didn't you? Yes, you said that, didn't you? Ah, you didn't. Where is the $2 billion hole in this year's budget? Has it gone already? That is what you and the Prime Minister said. Both of you said that I was punching a $2 billion hole in this year's budget and, when I confront you with that, what a deafening silence from the other side. The truth is there is no money in this year's budget at all from airport privatisation, and that is on page 3-214 of the budget papers. Not only were you caught out about the link between foreign debt and interest rates by your own budget papers, but your dishonesty on this issue has also been exposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no hole being punched in this year's budget. Not a dollar has been taken out of this year's budget by the decision announced by the coalition yesterday. So lie No. 1 of Keating and Brereton on this issue has been nailed. There is no hole at all in this year's budget: let me make that perfectly clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I make very clear is that we are in no way opposed to the privatisation of the airports at Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide or, indeed, anywhere else in Australia. We are not opposed to their privatisation, and in fact we are not opposed to the privatisation of Sydney airport. But we are opposed to privatisation at any cost. It passes very strange that members of the Australian Labor Party&mdash;who for years said that privatising anything was anti-Australian, who for years said that to sell the Commonwealth Bank was like burning down the gum tree, that to sell the Commonwealth Bank would be to dishonour the memory of Ben Chifley and John Curtin, and we were told we stood for everything that was obscene and indecent in Australian life because we dared to argue the merits of privatisation&mdash;is now saying, `We will privatise, and to hell with the consequences for the people of Sydney.' That is what you are arguing. You are really arguing that privatisation, no matter what the cost, is the right way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not arguing that; we never have. I have never argued that you should privatise something irrespective of its impact on the public interest. I have always said that you privatise an asset when you are satisfied there is a public benefit. My argument on Sydney airport is that you privatise it once you fix the noise problem. It is as simple as that. I am not saying, `Don't privatise it'; I am saying, `Fix the noise problem first.' It is as simple as that. It has nothing to do with economic vandalism, it has nothing to do with the comparative credentials of the Prime Minister and me on economic policy; it has everything to do with whether you care about the interests of the people of Sydney, and you do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You talk about holes being punched in budgets, you talk about it being a great micro-economic reform. I now know what is really wrong with the prime ministership of this country. If Paul Keating believes what he did at Sydney airport was the greatest micro-economic reform for New South Wales in the last 20 years he is even more stupid and illiterate on economics than I thought he was.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department and the authority hold reports that they themselves have commissioned about the full and proper use of that facility; reports that have been provided by consultants with international reputations on the proper operation of airports, but the minister has refused to recognise them. This is a politically driven process. I have hundreds of letters from people in my electorate, as have other members, saying that for the first time their lives have been disrupted. The quality of life and the health of their families have been affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a copy of a letter written to Mr O'Keefe by Mr Allen Blewitt, who has lived for 22 years in the electorate of Grayndler, which is under the flight path. He is now living under the flight path in Cherrybrook, where the minister's decisions have so dramatically affected him and his lifestyle. Minister, you cannot get through on this one. Laurie's truck has to stop somewhere. It was the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) who used that expression when he thought he was branding the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the coalition's efforts to expose the government; but the fact is that he has branded you and the way in which you operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that Sydney needs Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport to operate fully and properly, and Badgerys Creek needs to go ahead. The half-baked process you have used with both of them puts the lie to your real interest in this matter for the benefit of the people of New South Wales. You have refused to recognise that there should be a proper and full economic use of the facility at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. You are talking about levels of operation that are not in the best interests of the people of Sydney. The load should be shared. The load should be spread. There are people in your electorate and my electorate that are willing to share that load, but you are not prepared to accept a perfectly reasonable proposition. In return, the coalition has stated that it will withhold its support until some reason and rationale come to you and your leader. It is no good his strutting the country and claiming that he represents all Australians. Most Australians know that he does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's example on this issue illustrates how he believes a narrow minority interest overrides the interest of the majority. That is the game that he is playing. He is playing the narrow field to gain benefit from a few people. He needs to think of the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson). He needs to think of a wider range of people. He needs to act as a national leader. One of the reasons that he will not be re-elected to office is that people see the arrogance of the way in which he makes decisions and the way in which you support him. It is all cap in hand, no matter what the rationale, the logic or the economic outcomes. You will get the privatisation. All the minister needs to do is have a good look at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, adopt the recommendations of consultants that have provided information to the authority and to your department and make good use of the airport. Then you will get the privatisation that you so earnestly want&mdash;despite the feelings in this instance of many members of the Labor Party who do not want the privatisation to go ahead. You will get our support if you do the right thing and use Sydney properly to the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could certainly pick up from where the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) left off in saying that this issue lies exclusively in the hands of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). If the minister is prepared to accede to the very reasonable request of the coalition, which is to reopen the east-west runway, there is absolutely no reason why his plans for privatisation cannot proceed. It is as simple as that. Any suggestion that it is being delayed by the opposition is absolute nonsense. It would be a valid criticism if the demand that we were making were an unreasonable demand. But it is not an unreasonable demand to ask that the noise burden over Sydney be spread around. The government keeps quoting some remarks that I made in 1989. The remarks that I made were not made on the basis that all of the noise from aircraft in Sydney should be exclusively dumped on one part of the city.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did not even know that the east-west runway intersects only one runway. He said at one stage during his speech that it intersected both of them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I direct the House's attention to the mountain of evidence that has been given before the Senate inquiry on the issue of safety. Pilot after pilot, air traffic controller after air traffic controller came before that inquiry and said it was perfectly safe to reopen the east-west runway. Only last night, after an interview I did on television, I was rung by a former managing director of Qantas who said that he completely supported the stand I was taking and that it was perfectly safe and perfectly feasible to reopen the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that you took a political decision to close the east-west runway. That was documented in the Laurie Oakes article I read out to the House yesterday. It was all about your own political convenience. You talk about headlands in Hunters Hill but what about the people in Mary Easson's electorate who also live under the north-south flight path? What about all the people who live in the inner suburbs of Sydney? Don't you think they ought to be consulted or are you so obsessed with your political attacks that you forget the situation in which many of those people are placed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a complicated issue; it is a very simple issue. It has nothing to do with punching holes in budgets. I have already demonstrated that it has no impact at all on this year's budget. It is all about the fair sharing of a burden. One of the great Australian traditions is that Australians will always support the fair sharing of a burden. If they are told there is a problem and that some burden has to be assumed in solving that problem, they will go along with that solution, provided they are honestly apprised of the facts and the burden is fairly shared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not asking that some areas of Sydney that now have noise become completely noiseless, what we are asking is that there be a sharing around of the burden. It is a very simple proposition. We are not opposed to privatisation but we are opposed to privatisation at any cost. We believe the public interest has to be cared for in privatisation and that any privatisation has to run the test of public benefit. This privatisation fails the test unless and until the noise burden is tackled and the third runway is reopened. In the great Australian tradition to which we all ought to subscribe, the burden ought to be fairly shared. It is as simple as that. It is in the hands of the minister. He will be the person indicted at the bar of public opinion if the public interest is not properly served and not properly met on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate today is about the present. It is about individual Australians who are suffering as a result of your policy. The public are not foolish. They express themselves rather well. Here is a letter which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposed by the government is not directed to solving problems but to off-loading problems, regardless of the consequences, coupled with a quick grab for funds. Since the opening of the so-called third runway, the planning for Sydney's airport has been abysmal and riddled with problems. The thought that the government intends to keep and pass on these problems, which can only get worse, for prosperity through legislation is even more worrying.</PARA>
<PARA>The public sees the problems very well. I said yesterday that your technique was to confuse and abuse. Precisely what you have done again this morning is confuse and abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point No. 1 on confusion involves the safety issue. Where is the answer from the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to our proposal about opening the east-west runway, which would put Sydney in the same position as Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth? The logic of the minister's argument, which is that somehow we in Sydney are less smart than the people who run the airports in Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne, just does not wash. If they can handle it in other parts of Australia, what is it about Sydney and the minister that says that somehow the people in Sydney are less competent than those who run it with perfect safety in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It puts it back to the same situation where we were running it for 40 years and it was considered to be safe. Here we now have the minister saying that somehow we are not as smart in Sydney as they are in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point of confusion and abuse is the hole in the budget question. There sure is a hole in the budget. Do you know why? Because the sale of Qantas was $0.5 billion short. We were going to sell the AIDC and we are now not selling it. In fact, the government is going to buy back the shares. The ANL sale is less than satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were supposed to see the Commonwealth Bank legislation in the May session. The Commonwealth Bank itself said, when the government announced it was to sell the remaining half, that it needed to see the legislation in May so that it could properly plan for the buyback of $1 billion worth of shares from the government, not from ordinary shareholders. They needed to see it in May. The best evidence we have at the moment is the answer I got from the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) the other day when he told me that they were not going to bring in the legislation until after the election because, in the words of the managing director of the Commonwealth Bank, an election might make things difficult for the government to deal with in the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They planned for $5.3 billion worth of asset sales, not to retire debt or build something for Australia but to spend. It is like selling the house to pay the grocery bill. The $2 billion that is relevant to the first tranche of the FAC is projected for the next financial year&mdash;1996-97&mdash;not this financial year. Guess what? We are having an election between now and then. So the minister is right to say that there is a hole in the budget, but it is the government's fault. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saying that before you privatise Kingsford Smith you have to solve the problems that are facing the people and not discount them, push them under the rug and say that it is somebody else's problem. That is the difference between us and them. We care about individuals; they care about stitching up groups and passing them on. They rule for the elite and the privileged. That same attitude has put us in the situation where, in the last 12 years, the people of Australia have become poorer while the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his predecessor have become personally rich. It is a bit rich for the government to come in here and say that we are putting a hole in their budget when we are talking about a budget we have not even seen yet. It is the budget that comes after the next election. If the Australian people are sensible, the government will not be running it. </PARA>

It is interesting that the minister is wanting to refer to people's memories and has drawn upon quotes in favour of the development of a third runway as if it is in some way inconsistent with the proposition that is being put now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some comments on the amendment moved by the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). I do so because I think this whole debate justifies the tag that he is the Ronald Biggs of Australian politics. He is running around this House pretending that he does not have a past. But, unlike Ronald Biggs, he does not have a future. That is what this debate demonstrates. It demonstrates that he does have a past and he cannot pretend to ignore it. Even more disturbingly he has now demonstrated that he is an economic vandal&mdash;so insensitive to the needs of the tourism industry of this country that he could propose to halve the capacity of Sydney airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourist industry is one of those industries that have been the great economic generators and job generators of the last decade. He wants to go in and vandalise that industry. But worse than that: what are the consequences of this amendment for people who live in Brisbane? What are the consequences of this amendment for the Brisbane airport? I will tell you what they are. If he halves the capacity of Sydney airport, they will be going to Brisbane. I would like people in Brisbane to very clearly understand that it is a policy of the Liberal Party to increase the movements at Brisbane airport by at least 10 per hour. So when they have problems in Brisbane with aircraft noise, they can point to whom would be responsible if he had his way&mdash;J.W. Howard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this means. If he is going to halve the capacity of Sydney airport, where are those planes going to go? If they had a choice between Melbourne and Brisbane, I am sure they would take Brisbane. When we debate the problems of aircraft noise in Brisbane, let it be clearly understood in the northern suburbs of Brisbane both north of the river and south of the river what the policy of the Liberal Party is on aircraft noise there&mdash;more international flights into Brisbane and less out of Sydney. That is the policy of J.W. Howard. I will have great joy in explaining Liberal Party policy to the residents of Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But worse than that: not only is he an economic vandal when it comes to the future prospects of the tourist industry; it brings us to the very basic question of aircraft safety. One of the great pleasures and responsibilities I have had since I have been in this House is of being a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. The most chilling moment I have had on that committee was when we went over to BASI, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, to see the simulation of an accident that nearly happened at Sydney a couple of years ago on those intersecting runways. Not only did the two planes nearly hit but also, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said this morning, there was one sitting beside them. Had that collision occurred, in excess of 1,000 people could have died. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have the hide to come into this House and argue that, somehow, those sorts of intersecting runway patterns are safe&mdash;flying in the face of all that evidence that has come from BASI, just ignoring it. Why? So J.W. Howard can protect the residents of his electorate. But let us not worry about air safety and let us not worry about consistency because one thing is for sure: he will say anything and do anything to win a vote. It does not matter whether people could be killed; it does not matter about consistency when it comes to air safety; it does not matter about the future prospects of the tourist industry&mdash;none of that matters.

He has done them no help at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) made very clear this morning what the issue was and, as he said, it is very simple. Where does the minister at the table, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), live? He lives on the end of runway 07 at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. Where does the member for Barton (Mr Punch) live? He lives on the end of runway 25 at Sydney airport. That is the reason the east-west runway has been closed at Sydney airport&mdash;for blatant political reasons. The minister has been caught out and the defence of himself this morning will be recognised for what it is: it will be recognised as absolute hypocrisy. That particular runway has been closed for blatant political reasons, that is, to put all of the noise at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport on to the residents to the north and the south of the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason this decision has been taken. Let there be no confusion over the issue. The fact is that we on this side of the House supported&mdash;I certainly supported it in the years before I entered this parliament when I was a member of a council in the northern suburbs of Sydney&mdash;the construction of the second runway at Sydney to increase the capacity of Sydney airport as an interim measure. I was involved in studies back in the 1970s. All of the studies put forward the reason for the construction of the second runway as being to increase the capacity until the second major Sydney airport, which has now been chosen to be sited at Badgerys Creek, could proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the government has decided since then to close the east-west runway, what has happened is that the capacity of Sydney airport has been reduced. I think members in this place have made it clear that there was never an understanding that the east-west runway&mdash;07/25&mdash;would be closed: it was always going to remain open. That was absolutely fundamental to the whole process: if that was not going to be the case, all the money that was spent on the parallel runway to increase the capacity of the airport would be wasted. That is where we are at today. Instead of a capacity of 100 to 120 movements per hour, we are getting 60&mdash;because of the decision to close the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Safety is not a factor. That is a red herring and the minister knows it. For him and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the honourable member for Lilley to start talking about the occurrence of a near miss at the intersection some years ago is a furphy. It is simply a misrepresentation of what actually happened. Simops was the procedure that was operating at the time. As a result of that incident the procedure was changed. As I recall it, the pilot of the aircraft that was largely at fault that day was foreign and misunderstood the instructions he was given. After that, the procedures were changed and Simops was operated on a restricted basis for Australian domestic flights. It worked from then on and can work perfectly well today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could put an argument as to why Simops could come into operation at Sydney airport tomorrow, but we are not even talking about the reintroduction of Simops with the operation of the east-west runway. Does the minister understand that we are not advocating a reintroduction of simultaneous operations? We are advocating the use of the east-west runway for properly programmed departures and arrivals. It is an insult to the air traffic controllers at Sydney airport or anywhere else to suggest that that cannot occur perfectly safely. It can. It works everywhere else in the world. It can work at Sydney airport, but it will not be allowed to work for blatant political reasons. Neither the minister nor the Prime Minister or anyone else on the government side can wriggle out of that. This is a lie. The minister has been caught out. The people of Sydney and New South Wales&mdash;from country and metropolitan Sydney areas&mdash;know it. He will not be able to argue his way out of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) says that all the expert advice substantiates his case. His senatorial colleague the former Minister for Transport, Senator Collins, in the Senate last year on 29 November, as reported at page 3464 of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, in answer to a question from Senator Parer, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CAA is in the position that if a decision is taken to re-open the east-west runway, it will make it workable.</PARA>
<PARA>That is on top of comments that the Minister for Transport, Senator Collins, as he was at the time, made in the Senate in 1991&mdash;that he believed it could be made to work and that it would be safe and effective to keep open, at that stage, the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would have to look at a whole host of people who know about aviation safety. I challenge anybody in this chamber to judge who knows more about aviation safety in this country&mdash;the Minister for Transport sitting opposite, or the people who fly the aeroplanes and have the lives of people in their hands every day, people such as the Australian International Pilots Association, which gave evidence to the Senate inquiry into aircraft noise just recently. In a submission to the Senate inquiry into Sydney's aircraft noise problems, the pilots called for the government to reopen the east-west runway as the only way to ease the noise and air traffic congestion problems. In the same submission they also said that the new flight paths in Sydney have increased rather than decreased the aircraft noise problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have always promised the people of Sydney that you were doing everything to fix the problem, but in fact you were not. The fact we are debating this amendment today, and that earlier this morning we were debating the legislation regarding aircraft curfews, is proof evident that you have not been doing everything to fix the problem of aircraft noise in Sydney. It took the private member's bill of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to flush you out, to get you to enact this legislation, otherwise you would not be here today debating this issue. So when you have been telling the people of Sydney, who are outraged about the aircraft noise that you have pushed over their heads, that you have done everything that could be done to fix the problem, the fact is that you have not. The fact we are here now debating this is proof evident of that. We need to understand that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people have spoken on this matter, not just those I have quoted. The Regional Airlines Association, with Hazeltons, were in this House yesterday indicating to us why the east-west runway should be reopened and how you can make that operation both safe and effective. A whole host of people, including the airlines' board representatives, have said that you should reopen the east-west runway, that it can be done safely and effectively. All these people know more about aviation than you, me or anybody else in this chamber. All those people know more than you or me, and they say we should reopen this east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you know the reason the government is taking this stand? It is to cover up for the decision made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) back in 1989. I will quote again from the Laurie Oakes article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> in December of last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original proposal was supposed to be that aircraft should take off only to the south and land from the south so that they flew over water rather than houses. Clever Keating changed that and sent them roaring over suburbia. The east-west runway was supposed to continue operating, but it was Keating who killed that idea, too, and ensured that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">all</EMPHASIS> planes operated on the north-south axis.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the reason there is outrage in Sydney today. That is the reason, in the House today, the minister feels most uncomfortable having to defend what he is defending. It is because he has to cover up for his now Prime Minister who then, as Treasurer, influenced the cabinet to close the east-west runway and to put all flights out of Sydney airport on the north-south axis. That is the reason we are here today. It is the reason those people in Sydney have had the quality of their lives destroyed, the value of their houses decimated, and it is the reason they have had to get out into the streets to demonstrate against the decisions, actions and incompetence of this government. </PARA>

The honourable member said that the regional airlines propose to operate along the lines of the opposition's proposal and that it can be done safely. That is simply untrue. I have with me the proposal of the regional airlines, and it does not involve jets on the east-west runway, it does not involve intersecting runway operations at all, and it does not involve Simops. It involves, and I quote, giving `maximum capacity'&mdash;and that is so that no-one has to go to Badgerys Creek, I might say. The proposal goes on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is imperative to open the east-west runway to regional aircraft that have a very low noise factor.</PARA>

<PARA>The enactment of this bill would set the salary of the next Governor-General after he is sworn in on 16 February 1996. Because section 3 of the constitution fixes the salary of the Governor-General for the term of office, the salary fixed at the commencement of the Governor-General's appointment must be set at a level that will still be appropriate at the end of the term. The Income Tax Assessment Act provides that the official salary of the Governor-General shall be exempt from income tax. </PARA>

It was amended in 1977 to increase the salary to $37,000, amended in 1982 to increase the salary to $70,000, and amended in 1988 to increase the salary to $95,000. It is now proposed that the Governor-General's salary be $58,000. The salary will remain unchanged through the period of the next Governor-General's appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In proposing this salary for the next Governor-General, I would like honourable members to note that Sir William Deane has requested that the salary be set to take account of the non-contributory pension which he will receive under the Judges' Pensions Act after retiring from the High Court. Payment of this pension will continue during his term of office as Governor-General. At the commencement of the term of office, the sum of Sir William's net pension and the proposed salary would be in the order of $130,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle that has governed the calculation of this amount is that used to determine the salaries of governors-general in the past&mdash;that is, to keep the average salary over the notional period of the appointment somewhat ahead of the estimated average annual income, after tax, of the Chief Justice of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I myself particularly welcomed one of Sir William's remarks in accepting the post upon its public announcement when he referred to the fact that political authority in Australia ultimately rests with the people. This is a very basic principle but a principle which lies at the heart of Australia's constitutional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, as members would know, Australia's constitution only came into being after it was first approved of by the people in referenda held across the then colonies. You cannot formally change the words of Australia's constitution without the consent of the people. As the Queen's representative, this statement of, and endorsement by, Sir William Deane reflects the complexity of Australia's political arrangements.

<PARA>The ANL Sale Bill makes the necessary legislative provision to facilitate the sale of the Commonwealth's shares in ANL Ltd, although agreement has been reached under which the finalisation of the sale to P&amp;O Australia has been deferred until 31 October 1995. Finalisation of sale arrangements is subject to the satisfactory conclusion of negotiations on ANL's future industrial arrangements and the retention by the Commonwealth of a special share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANL is a shipping company wholly owned by the Commonwealth. It formerly operated as the Australian National Line and was converted to a public company, with effect from 1 July 1989. The government first announced its intention to sell a substantial part of ANL in the context of the 1991-92 budget. A scoping study was undertaken which concluded in 1992 that, given its then trading circumstances, a sale of less than 100 per cent of the company was unlikely to be commercially feasible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1994 a further consultancy was undertaken as the first stage of a due diligence process into ANL. The due diligence process is a thorough examination of the company which, among other things, is designed to give a firm understanding of its assets and liabilities. That report was completed in August 1994 and its recommendation was that, due to ANL's poor financial position and bleak outlook, a sale was unlikely to be possible at that time and that the government's best option was likely to be a managed trade-down of the company. This would have meant an effective liquidation of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than pursue this option, the government decided to appoint a new board, headed by Mr Neville Wran, to undertake further analysis, restructure the company and examine future options. The government also announced its intention to provide guarantees in respect of ANL's debt and any future drawdowns under its promissory note facility so as to enable the restructuring to be carried out in a stable commercial environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANL board carried out some considerable restructuring of the line, including the sale of ANL's interest in Australian Stevedores, the winding-up of joint ventures with Howard Smith in bulk shipping and with Union Shipping in the trans-Tasman trade, the payout of a bank debt facility and the lease on the ship <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">River Torrens</EMPHASIS> and some rationalisation of overseas and corporate staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having received and pursued a number of inquiries, the board reported, earlier this year, that there was interest from a number of companies in the purchase of some or all of ANL, including proposals from two companies which may have involved the purchase of all of the Commonwealth's shares in ANL. In May 1995, the government agreed to the board progressing with potential bidders' expressions of interest in the purchase of the Commonwealth's shares in the company. In the event, one bid was received, being from P&amp;O Australia, and this was not for the purchase of ANL with all of its existing liabilities. Based on that bid, the board and Commonwealth officials have been able to negotiate an agreement under which P&amp;O would purchase the Commonwealth's shares in ANL, subject to a number of conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has had discussions with ANL unions, with the ACTU and with P&amp;O on the sale option. Deferral of a decision to finalise the sale to P&amp;O until 31 October 1995 will allow P&amp;O and the unions, under the leadership of the Secretary of the ACTU, to conduct negotiations on ANL's future industrial arrangements. Subject to the satisfactory completion of those negotiations, the sale to P&amp;O will be finalised. If the unions and P&amp;O cannot reach a resolution acceptable to them and to the government, then the option of restructuring ANL to increase the potential for it to return to viability will be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order for the option of a sale to P&amp;O to be quickly carried out at the completion of the negotiations between unions and P&amp;O, it will be necessary for the ANL Sale Bill to be passed by both houses of parliament by the end of October. P&amp;O is keen to be in a position to take action to turn ANL's results around. Any further delay creates uncertainty, with the risk of consequent damage to ANL's market share in its various businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substantive provisions of the bill do not come into operation until the draft sale contract is signed. Should the contract not be signed by the end of 1995, the legislation provides for its automatic repeal on 1 January 1996. The bill makes transitional and savings provisions in relation to ANL employee long service leave, maternity leave, compensation and rehabilitation, and certain retirement benefits that have become standard in legislation providing for the disposal of major Commonwealth assets, as for example in the sales of Qantas, ASTA and CSL Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three major features of this bill which have arisen out of the negotiation of the draft sale contract and the recent discussions between the government, unions and P&amp;O in relation to the sale. The first feature relates to the provisions which flow from the fact that P&amp;O is not willing to purchase all of ANL's businesses nor take on all of ANL's liabilities. The second feature is the provision of an appropriation to meet any contributions required by the Commonwealth under the draft sale contract. The third feature is the need to provide for the protection of the future industrial arrangements that are being negotiated with P&amp;O. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To move the required businesses and liabilities out of ANL and convert ANL into a company with reduced liabilities, the bill provides for the transfer of certain of ANL's assets, rights, liabilities and obligations to a nominated company&mdash;or a subsidiary of that company&mdash;or to the Commonwealth direct. The nominated company, which is called `RetainCo' in the bill, must be wholly owned by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANL, under P&amp;O Australia's ownership, will continue to hold around $140 million of debt, in the form of ship and container leases and drawdowns under ANL's promissory note facility.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assets, liabilities, rights and obligations to be transferred out of ANL will primarily be long-term ship leases and associated transaction documents, as well as several dormant ANL subsidiary companies. If a sale of ANL's shares in the Coastal ExpressLine business on satisfactory terms is not concluded prior to a sale to P&amp;O, a holding company structure will be utilised to protect the Commonwealth's interests in this business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the sale the Commonwealth will continue to hold liabilities in the form of obligations under the long-term ship leases transferred from ANL to RetainCo. RetainCo's obligations under the ship leases are, however, to be substantially matched by reciprocal income streams under long-term subleases of the ships to major companies&mdash;including ANL after the sale. These long-term subleases are either in place or the subject of negotiations in train. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The liabilities of RetainCo, in total around $183 million, will progressively diminish over time as the leases are paid out and it is expected that RetainCo will be at least cash neutral to the Commonwealth over the long term; that is, there should be no net call on Commonwealth funds to meet RetainCo's obligations over its life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for a Commonwealth guarantee to be granted in respect of the obligations transferred to RetainCo. As the company will not be a commercially operating company in the ordinary sense, a guarantee will be required to give comfort to financiers that it will be able to meet its obligations. There is the possibility that RetainCo or an ANL company transferred to the Commonwealth may require operating funds in its initial year and the bill appropriates any funds necessary to provide working capital for 1995-96 for RetainCo or for the holding company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also appropriates up to $15 million to meet any Commonwealth contribution required under the draft sale contract. There are three elements to this contribution. The first element is to cover the contingency that relevant financiers may exercise change of ownership rights which would impose additional costs on the Commonwealth. Those financiers have, however, already provided in-principle consent to the change of ownership. Other elements of the $15 million include any expenses, such as legal costs, related to the transfer of businesses out of ANL to RetainCo or the Commonwealth direct, and a contingency to provide for the possibility that ANL's operating results up to the date of sale are significantly worse than forecast. Current expectations are that only a small percentage of the $15 million will be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the industrial arrangements to be negotiated in respect of ANL, the bill provides for the articles of association of ANL to contain special articles which will enshrine the outcome of those negotiations. The special articles will not be able to be altered or removed without the consent of the minister, and the ministerial consent is to be an instrument required to be laid before parliament and subject to disallowance. The consent will not be effective until the disallowance period has expired. The bill provides for the minister to have the power to seek injunctions in the Federal Court to enforce the observance of the special articles and to prevent their removal or alteration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for alterations to ANL's tax position as a consequence of the sale. ANL's accounting period is to be aligned with P&amp;O's and the holding of the special share by the Commonwealth is to be deemed not to prevent ANL being treated as a wholly owned subsidiary of P&amp;O for tax purposes. ANL's accumulated tax losses, of about $70 million, for the period before the sale will be extinguished and will, therefore, not be available to P&amp;O to offset against profits post-sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes that a sale is the preferred option and the bill will facilitate the realisation of a long-term future for ANL. ANL is currently losing around $2 million per month in its operations. ANL has some cash reserves, which were obtained from the sale of some of its assets, but once these have been exhausted&mdash;a matter of months, not years&mdash;it would require cash support from the taxpayer to continue to trade. This is not a sensible long-term approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative to a sale is, therefore, a further major restructuring aimed at eliminating the likely need for taxpayer funding, which would see ANL withdraw from a number of trades and reduce in size. There is a risk that the resulting small organisation will lack sufficient resources to withstand any future poor trading periods. As is currently the case, ANL would not be able to influence in any significant way the freight rates paid by Australian importers and exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the sale is completed, ANL will continue to carry Australia's container imports and exports as a separate entity within the P&amp;O group. P&amp;O has indicated its intention to maintain ships under the Australian flag, crewed by Australian crews under Australian award conditions. Commonwealth ownership is not essential for there to be a continued Australian flag presence in international trades. In order to enhance the prospects of ANL's longer term commercial viability, and in the best interests of Australian taxpayers and the public at large, a sale to P&amp;O Australia is the government's preferred course of action, subject to a satisfactory outcome to the current industrial negotiations. Passage of this legislation is required urgently to enable the sale to be completed as soon as this negotiation process has concluded. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) outlining some reasons why this second reading debate should be postponed&mdash;indeed, the reason being to allow proper time for consideration of the implications of the ANL Sale Bill.

In the letter I dealt specifically with the highly controversial $15 million appropriation, payments from which are outside the scrutiny of the parliament. I will deal with this matter today. The minister replied to me this morning that he will not delay the debate. Accordingly, I advise that we will vote against the bill in this place and pursue our investigations in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANL Sale Bill makes provisions to facilitate the sale of the Commonwealth's share in ANL. It could well be described in its short title as the ANL liquidation bill, because that is essentially what it does. The sale of ANL has a turbulent history dating back to the government's first announcement in the 1991 budget of its intention to dispose of 49 per cent of its equity in the shipping line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following a scoping study by Price Waterhouse-Potter Warburg it was recommended that the government completely divest itself of its stake in ANL considering the lack of buyers for only part of the company. It is now five years on and the sale of ANL remains in dry dock with the likelihood of the sale proceeding dependent on trade union concurrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has thrown this legislation into the parliament with insufficient time allowed to consider the implications of the bill. I am afraid to say this is endemic of the way the government goes about its capricious approach to privatisation. It is simply motivated by its greed to get the money and spend it and completely lacks planning. This bill is being introduced at a time when negotiations are still under way between the asset sales task force and the board of ANL, P&amp;O Australia Ltd and the Maritime Union of Australia for the sale of those shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the militant stance of the MUA and other unions close to ANL, the government has once again allowed the ACTU to dictate policy&mdash;sacrificing financial acumen in favour of the demands of its union mates. On 13 September 1994 we saw just what lengths this government would go to in order to placate the unions. Facing industrial action on the waterfront, this government signed off an agreement with the MUA with terms and conditions that included, firstly, paying shipowners with vessels engaged in international trade a taxable grant equivalent of the normal PAYE tax paid by crew members on those vessels and, secondly, the unions developing a consortium to acquire a major interest in ANL. The first demand has been dealt with by the introduction of legislation into this parliament. The second demand has a greater sense of immediacy for the bill that is before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the bill purports to provide for the sale of ANL to P&amp;O only, this is not necessarily the true intent of the bill. The definitional clauses relating to the sale agreement and the sale day allow a minority parcel of shares in ANL to be sold to someone other than P&amp;O prior to the designated sale day. Clause 5(1) of the bill provides for the minister to declare in writing the day the sale agreement is entered into as the agreement day. Clause 5(3) defines the agreement as the day on which a majority of the voting shares is acquired by one or more persons not being the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth entity. Clause 5(2) provides that the agreement day, as I have just defined it, shall be declared to be the sale day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 3 of the bill defines the sale agreement as an agreement between the Commonwealth and P&amp;O for the sale of all shares in ANL to P&amp;O except the golden share to be kept by the government. However, the sale day is defined as being in accord with clause 5(2) and, read together with clause 5(3), envisages a transfer of only a majority of shares. Thus, a transfer could be made prior to the sale date of a minority of shares, as I said, to someone other than P&amp;O as the requirement to transfer all shares is only those held as at the sale date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sticking point of this bill is this: what is the real purpose of the $15 million appropriation of taxpayers' money which is outside the scrutiny of this parliament? This parliament will not be able to know how and where that money is spent. It is clause 67 of the bill which appropriates the $15 million and provides that the minister may make payments as required to be made by the sale agreement. We will presumably not see that sale agreement, nor the schedules to it which are referred to in the legislation, because there will be a claim of commercial-in-confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the second term of the settlement of the union dispute in September last year. That was the one that gave the right to the unions to develop a consortium to acquire a majority interest in ANL. The bill, as drafted, would allow the unions to acquire such an interest. With what intent, one might ask? Well, let us take a look at what the appropriations provision allows. Clause 67(1) appropriates the sum of $15 million, but the purpose of that appropriation is totally obscure. The bill says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister may make payments totalling no more than $15,000,000 that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) are required to be made by the sale agreement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the terms of which we will not see&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the Minister believes are necessary or desirable to facilitate the transfer from an ANL body of an asset, liability, right or obligation described in Schedule B to the sale agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>We will not see the schedule either. These provisions thus pose more questions than the bill provides answers. Firstly, we will presumably not, as I said, be able to see the agreement either before or after the proposed sale; so we will not know what may trigger a payment pursuant to clause 67(1). However, we do know that the unions could take a stake in ANL prior to the sale day and that a term of the sale agreement, as provided for in clause 67(1)(a), could be that a premium was to be paid to the union or the consortium involving the ANL unions from that $15 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just so we understand the way the bill is structured, there could be a payment of heaven knows how much paid out of that $15 million appropriation straight to the unions, and we need never know about it. That premium could be far in excess of the per share value that was paid by P&amp;O, and it would be a legal payment because such an agreement is the sort that was envisaged in the recent High Court decision of Gambotto and WCP Ltd, which would support such a transaction. The High Court held that an expropriation of a minority shareholding, which would be the case, as I have just outlined, is only permissible for a proper purpose, such as where the minority shareholding as provided for in the deal with the ANL unions last September and expropriation in accordance with Gambotto's case would indeed be a term of the agreement, and the minister could then pass over taxpayers' funds straight to his union mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would not be the first time the government has placed the interests of its mates before the company and the country. The sacking of the entire nine-member board by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), only to replace it with a new board of old mates&mdash;Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and one other fellow director&mdash;resulted in a triumvirate which has carried out some things that the old board refused to do. The sacked board wanted a full due diligence study before signing off on such a study in discharge of their obligations under the Corporations Law. The new board did not conduct the due diligence study as the old board thought proper, but this became part and parcel of this current scheme, for which, I might add, that threesome&mdash;Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and one other&mdash;has been paid in excess of $816,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back in time to see the process set in motion by Laurie Brereton that has brought us to this bill. Much publicity has been given in the media to 22 August 1994 as the date when ANL was devalued by Laurie Brereton with his `you couldn't give it away' statement, announcing that the ANL privatisation was cancelled. However, 1 March 1994 was the date that Laurie Brereton, as a representative of executive government of the Commonwealth, undermined the whole process of privatisation by actually decorporatising ANL Ltd and commenced the devaluing of ANL shares. That was the day&mdash;1 March 1994&mdash;when Laurie Brereton undermined the lawfully constituted board of ANL by taking away the sale process from the board and depriving the board of funds for carrying on its commercial operations without the minister's approval. That was the day that Laurie Brereton took control of ANL Ltd&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. N.B. Reid)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! It would be helpful if the shadow minister called the minister by his correct title. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Mrs BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This was the day that Minister Brereton took control of ANL Ltd and nominated the task force on asset sales established under the Minister for Finance to be the point of reference for all inquiries for the sale. That was the day when Minister Brereton told the board that they had to seek formal approval for any action which would impact significantly on the Commonwealth sale options. That was the same day that Minister Brereton told the board that he and the Minister for Finance, the present Deputy Prime Minister, considered that draw-downs of either the multioption facility or promissory note, without approval, would significantly affect the sale. The audited accounts of ANL Ltd show that the fully underwritten promissory note facility of $100 million was drawn down to the extent of $45 million as at 30 June 1994, and the multioption facility was $4.1 million drawn on to that date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How did the minister achieve this decorporatisation and undermining of the ANL board? The minister claimed to achieve this by purportedly acting under powers vested in him under section 45 of the ANL Act of 1956. The minister amended the articles of association of ANL Ltd to ensure that the directors do not take any action or enter into any transaction that so-called might prejudice the Commonwealth's sale options, in which was included drawing down on their facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, on 1 March 1994, ANL Ltd was to all intents and purposes decorporatised. It is questionable that the minister had the power, by an amendment to the articles, to override the intent and purpose of the specific provisions of the ANL (Conversion into Public Company) Act 1988 and the attendant regulations to corporatise ANL with responsibility placed on the independent board. So the question is: did the minister act outside his power?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, the minister had no power to deprive the board of its powers under the Corporations Act. Certainly, the minister did not have the power to relieve the board of its fiduciary responsibilities under the Corporations Act merely by amending the articles of association of ANL Ltd. The real question is: did both Minister Brereton and Minister Beazley exceed the authority given to them by cabinet? So let's have a look at what the extent of the authority given to the minister by cabinet was, and what the purpose of that authority to amend the ANL articles of association was. At this point I would like to quote from the cabinet minute, No. 2563 of 21 February 1994, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further to Cabinet Minute of 16 December 1992 and Cabinet Minute 1748 of 1 June 1993, the Cabinet noted:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that the Minister for Transport would change ANL's Articles of Association immediately to require cooperation in the due diligence process&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Note the words `to require cooperation in the due diligence process'. But what did the Minister for Transport proceed to do with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, the present Deputy Prime Minister? They proceeded to usurp the power of the directors to carry out their own prudential checks to discharge their responsibility before signing off the due diligence study which the two ministers and their advisers were to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Transport met representatives of the board of ANL on 11 April 1994. It is clear that the minister did not want the board to do its own prudential checks and branded such moves as a parallel due diligence process. In other words, the board was not allowed to carry out the proper functions required of it by law. The board's understanding of the directive of the minister is set out in a letter to the minister dated 28 April 1994. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your requirement for a single due diligence process is noted, and the Board will ensure that the prudential steps that it will be necessary to take to discharge its responsibilities and to ensure the good management of the company within the Government's policy framework are not such as to constitute a parallel process. Indeed we believe the Board's prudential steps will fit easily into and assist the Government's due diligence process. The `Moore Stephens report' referred to in your letter is not intended to be a parallel due diligence process, but is intended to ensure that any concerns the Board or the Government might have in respect of the solvency of ANL Limited, over its period of sale and its accompanying uncertainties, can be put beyond doubt. You may recall my previous advice that the decision to engage Moore Stephens was made following the Directors conference in November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the advice of the board&mdash;the still intact board of ANL before its sacking&mdash;to the minister. As I said earlier, we now come to the crux of the problem. The board was not prepared merely to sign the due diligence report without full information on the basis of its preparation. The letter of 28 April also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We note your advice that the 1992 report of Potter Warburg and Price Waterhouse (`the PW Report') would not be used by the Government's financial and business advisers. However, we are concerned that the TFAS correspondence with the advisers (a copy of which was provided to ANL by TFAS) states that the report would be made available to the advisers. Furthermore, we understand that the report has been provided to the advisers. You will appreciate that both legal and commercial considerations make it necessary for the Directors to have access to every material piece of information used in the due diligence study if it is to be signed off by the Directors, and prima facie the PW Report would appear to be material. The relevant TFAS correspondence is attached for your information.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, there is the board properly complaining that it was not permitted to do its duty. This was the conflict between the minister and the board: the board was clearly not prepared to go with the minister's secret agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know that eventually no final due diligence report was prepared at all. The Auditor-General has described the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers report as a preliminary due diligence report, at best, in accordance with their terms of reference. The board would not go with the usurpation of its powers and responsibilities by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the consequences of this unlawful usurping by the minister of the power and responsibility which had been conferred on the board of ANL by this very parliament? On the very day that he decorporatised or re-departmentalised ANL&mdash;that is, 1 March 1994&mdash;he wrote to the chairman, explaining the impact on the board of the amendments to the articles of association which I mentioned earlier. I quote the salient features of that letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this background, the Government will this week be announcing its intention to begin a due diligence process for ANL. The Minister for Finance, through the Task Force on Asset Sales, will be engaging advisers to assist this task. It is the Government's intention to call for expressions of interest from potential purchasers after the preparation of an Information Memorandum, with a view to commencing the sale towards the end of 1994, taking into account the outcome of the ALP Conference to be held in September.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments which have now been made to the Articles of Association are attached. They have been formulated along the lines of those implemented for Qantas, enhanced by a requirement for ANL to seek formal approval of any action which will impact significantly on the Commonwealth's sale options.</PARA>
<PARA>In the same letter the minister then attempted to extricate himself from the responsibility for the barricades that he had built around the board, which significantly impacted on their ability to carry out normal commercial activity by the purported amendments to the articles of association. He adds in that letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether actions could be described as "significantly affecting a sale" will obviously be a matter of judgement for the Board. The onus must remain with ANL to use its commercial knowledge and judgement to identify such actions.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister then proceeded to administer the final act of stifling the board and, through it, the ANL, a national asset. He attempts to illustrate the sorts of transactions that the Minister for Finance and he believe would fall into that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, having told the board it had to exercise its responsibility and commercial expertise to decide what would impact on the sale options, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport then proceeded to outline what they thought would indeed be a sensible conclusion for the board to come to&mdash;trying to have it both ways&mdash;saying that they believed that the sorts of transactions that would fall into this category, that is, of transactions significantly affecting the sale, would be `drawdowns of either the multioption facility or promissory note'. The result is that the loss-making ANL was deprived of its lifeline, pending a final decision on the sale. It had no further access to credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What could have been the consequences of this act of apparent irresponsibility but to drive down the value of a national asset? The minister was advised by the board on 28 April 1994 of operational difficulties and of value erosion as a result of: firstly, the recent media reports of the sale process; secondly, the changes in the articles; thirdly, a need to minimise changes to the business profile while in the process of writing down the information memorandum; and, fourthly, a lack of a clear sale timetable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has also given examples in that letter of the problems which were of concern to the board. These include trade share values diminished; positioning by P&amp;O; business rationalisation opportunities lost; ownership considerations in ship management; trans-Tasman joint venture restructuring delayed; relationships with financiers undermined; Howard Smith Ltd losing confidence; shareholder deadlock possible at the Australian Stevedores, and customer and employee implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now history that Howard Smith Ltd lost confidence and a shareholder deadlock arose at Australian Stevedores on 11 July 1994 as a result of a lack of agreement by the directors of Australian Stevedores Holding Ltd on 26 May 1994 and 2 June 1994 on a strategy of conducting industrial relations at the Darling Harbour terminals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to the advice of the old and new boards, government decided to sell its interests in Australian Stevedores for $28 million on 9 September 1994. The audited accounts of ANL Ltd for the year ended 30 June 1994 record that the loss suffered by ANL in consequence of this sale was $14.7 million. But that is not the only consequence of the sale of Australian Stevedores. It is necessary to inquire why the old and the new boards of ANL advised against the sale of the Commonwealth's interest in Australian Stevedores. Both boards advised against the sale on the basis that stevedoring complemented ANL's business and it was in ANL's commercial interest to be involved in controlling the operations of Australian Stevedores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, if government were interested in privatising ANL as a whole and maximising the price, it would have enhanced the going concern value of ANL to expedite the sale of ANL. It is the minister's irresponsible actions and statements since 1 March 1994 that triggered off the deadlock provisions, and this was compounded by the lack of confidence in the minister being really interested or capable of dealing with the Australian Maritime Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the full cost of the Laurie Brereton RetainCo Bill. On 13 September 1994 the minister announced a wide ranging package of reforms to improve the performance of the shipping industry along with plans to put ANL back into the market. As a minimum the `reforms' included an estimated $20 million annual grant which is the equivalent of shippers being able to keep the PAYE tax collected by shippers from Australian seamen in international operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is this not odd coming from a minister who, on 22 August 1994, said that ANL's average loss of $19 million a year was critical to the decision to scuttle its privatisation and sack the then board? Yet on 13 September 1994, a little over three weeks later, an estimated $20 million grant a year as a minimum was given as the basis for the new burst of privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a director of a public company were a party to decision making of this sort that was endured by ANL and the company had been subsequently liquidated, the director concerned would have been liable under the Corporations Law. Some of these points were raised last week in the already established Senate inquiry into the proposed sale of ANL. The minister, by amending the articles, put himself in the position of being a director of ANL and would satisfy the definition of `director' under the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANL Sale Bill 1995 is a bill to liquidate ANL Ltd and the minister's intermeddling with ANL Ltd, a public company, would make him personally liable under the Corporations Law for the losses incurred by the taxpayers. I ask what the ASC intends to do about this, or will the government exercise the same sort of influence on the Australian Securities Commission as it did on the Australian Taxation Office when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) failed to lodge his tax returns and the Australian Taxation Office took no action and yet prosecuted 10,000 ordinary Australians? The ANL Sale Bill 1995 is a bill to liquidate ANL Ltd and the minister's intermeddling has brought him to this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the beginning of my speech that yesterday I wrote to the Minister for Finance requesting a postponement of this second reading debate.

This is because I hold in utter contempt what they would do to Australian shipping and those who work in the maritime industry. At least in the government proposals there are some small measures regarding conditions of employment, Australian flagging and Australian crewing. For example, the bill provides for preserving the pre-sale rights of ANL employees who have long service leave and maternity leave entitlements and certain retirement benefits under Commonwealth legislation while they remain ANL employees; makes it clear that ANL employees' access to public service mobility rights ceases on the sale day; ensures that the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 continues to apply after the sale in respect of injuries sustained by ANL Group employees prior to the sale; provides for the Commonwealth to hold a golden share in ANL post-sale and provides for the articles of association of ANL to contain certain rights relating to the national interest which are to be agreed to the satisfaction of P&amp;O and the Commonwealth during the period up to the execution of the draft sale agreement; and enables the Commonwealth to enforce the rights relating to national interest contained in the articles of association by seeking injunctions from the Federal Court.

And just as 10 years ago everyone was saying that greed is good, so today everyone is saying, `Privatisation is great.'

There are many differences in regard to, say, industrial relations, care of the environment, and some social issues.

Why are they so quiet now that the rest of the Commonwealth Bank is being sold off?' my response is that we lost the battle when the first 25 per cent was sold off. Those&mdash;on both sides&mdash;who voted for that first sell off, have little credibility to stand in the parliament today and criticise the banks for behaving in the way that they approved when they allowed the sale. </PARA>

One project, APIN, the increased army presence in the North, is going to cost $580 million. If we can spend that amount, why can we not spend some money on preserving our Australian shipping line?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was said about the Commonwealth Bank also applies to Australian shipping. When the crews of foreign ships are discovered in Burnie, Geraldton or Gladstone&mdash;and I went on a ship in Gladstone recently&mdash;we will find crews that have not been paid for months. Those crews are half starved&mdash;in one case they had been fed on watermelon for a week&mdash;and physically and sexually abused. We will read the breathless headlines in the newspaper saying, `How could this happen in Australia?' When the television crew's helicopter comes in to drag the last ounce of pathos out of these crews, people will stand up on both sides of this parliament and ask, `How could this happen in Australia?' and heap abuse on the owners. If we pass this legislation that is what we will find in Australia, and it will not be all that long before we find it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we pass this legislation today, in years to come there will be no use in claiming that we did not know the consequences.

That committees's report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame,</EMPHASIS> told us of the consequences. Many of us in this parliament today have spoken of the consequences. This legislation will destroy our credibility in international shipping communities, and open our coastline to the types of crews vividly portrayed in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>. These crews will be mostly untrained, and our coastline may be exposed to unimaginable environmental damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Colleagues, $21 million to save our coastline is what I am talking about. We need $21 million to have ships Australian crewed, Australian flagged, and with well paid and trained crews. It really is not a large amount to ask for. Consider that amount of $21 million. How much is our defence budget? The South Africans, in a country that I know a little about, decided that they needed decent roads for defence purposes. As a result, in many areas, particularly in white areas, they have magnificent highways paid for out of the defence budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia, being an island nation, it is imperative that we have a national shipping line as a defence measure. If we cannot fund it in any other way then surely we should think about funding it from the defence budget. Really, it is a defence measure to have a proper Australian shipping line. I made reference earlier on to APIN. We are going to spend $580 million there on one project over the next five years. Surely out of that $580 million we could find a measly $21 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government must be able to deliver a shipping policy. We must give long-term guarantees for current shipping and replacement.

Much has been said over recent weeks that perhaps would have been better left unsaid but let me make this clear: in my view ANL managers have never received a fair go. Commitments made to them have never been honoured. They have been undermined and they have been expected to perform with one hand tied behind their backs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot refrain from saying that I think today is a sad day for Australia, a sad day for Australian shipping, and it is, if this is passed, a day that we will rue. I am very pleased to see that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is at the table, because no-one has contributed more to the Australia Remembers project than the minister, and it has been a wonderfully bipartisan project. This year Australians remembered. We remembered those who made valiant sacrifices during the dark days of World War II. But off the Australian coast there are dozens of sunken ships with Australian mariners in watery graves. They paid the ultimate sacrifice for Australia. Is it not time we remembered them as well?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) was going like a threshing machine. We were all saying what a wonderful fellow he is, how he has at last seen the light after 20 years of drudgery as a member of the Labor Party. We thought that for the first time ever he was going to do the right thing. As he said in his speech, he opposes the government on this issue. From the content of his speech it is quite clear that he feels very passionate about what the government is proposing to do to his much beloved Australian National Line. We all thought that the member for Throsby was going to do the right thing and join us on this side of the House to vote against the government's dreadful legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the last few moments of his speech he showed his true colours. He showed us what a true hypocrite he is. Despite the passion of the words and despite his so-called courage in expressing his views in the chamber today in front of the Australian public, despite all those things, when push comes to shove the honourable member for Throsby is not there to be counted. He is a man of straw, not a man of substance. All those words ring hollow because, having said them, he is not prepared to back them up with the actions that would indicate to all and sundry that he really meant what he said. Indeed, it sounds to me as though the honourable member for Throsby, in his contribution to this debate today, has just read a speech somebody else has written for him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I find that very offensive. I wrote the speech myself this morning. No-one writes my speeches&mdash;which is different from others.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I would have thought that not being prepared to act upon the words that you have just said would indicate that they were not your own words. However, I will take it as said by the honourable member for Throsby that he wrote those words with his own hand and the words came from his own heart. It is just a shame he is not prepared to carry on and put those words into action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We so often see Labor Party people trying to show an independent view to the electorate by saying, `I voted against that' or `I spoke against that' but, when it comes down to actually doing the right thing by the constituency, they cannot do it. We have just seen a display of that. I daresay that the honourable member for Throsby's speech today had more to do with ensuring his preselection in one of the safest Labor Party seats in New South Wales than it had to do with his view of government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is interesting that my little friend in the Labor Party caucus told me that, when this matter came up for discussion in the caucus, not this week but last week, the honourable member for Throsby asked a question of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), about this important issue that he feels so strongly about. It is a shame though that he was not one of the other two people who opposed it when the time came to express their intentions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it has been an interesting speech from the honourable member for Throsby. I have enjoyed listening to him, although I was greatly saddened as he concluded his remarks today&mdash;as no doubt many of his supporters will have been, because they want him to stand up for their interests. He can do that only by crossing the floor and voting, as he said in his speech, against his party in government because he thinks their legislation is so wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Throsby has highlighted to us today, the status of the Australian National Line is a complete and utter disaster. Nobody in their right mind, no reasonable person, would accept the state that ANL is in today. Every reasonable person would say that the reason ANL is in the parlous state it is in today, why it is the disgrace it has become, is the actions of this government and, in particular, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who is responsible for the administration of ANL and, over the last 12 months, has been actively involved in the management of ANL. The status of ANL is a disaster and a disgrace and it proves for those who need further proof that the Minister for Transport is incompetent in the carriage of his task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a debate earlier today about the curfew at Sydney airport, further proof of the incompetence of the minister. We have seen a number of debates over recent time that prove the incompetence of the Minister for Transport. But the tragedy of it all is that whilst incompetence is an embarrassing thing for the Minister for Transport it comes at great cost to the taxpayers of Australia, because over the last four years this government has been fooling around with ANL, trying to sell it. One day it is going to be sold this way; another day it is going to be sold the other way. It has chopped and changed its views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Throsby said in his speech, the management of ANL has not been given a fair go. I agree with him. And the reason they have not been given a fair go is that this Labor government has been interfering in the administration and affairs of ANL in a non-commercial fashion, changing the status of ANL almost on a weekly basis to suit their own particular grubby political needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Throsby is right. ANL management has not been given a fair go, and you could extend that to say ANL workers are not being given a fair go. The government announced in 1991 it was going to privatise ANL and it has changed its view several times over between 1991 and today. As the honourable member for Throsby will know, not only has it changed its views as to how ANL will be privatised but indeed the ANL board of management has often found out what is going to happen to the company by reading about it in the paper. The evidence of the former chairman of ANL, Bill Bolitho, a man well known and regarded in maritime circles, is proof of that. Indeed, many other directors, one of whom, Pat Geraghty, is the former head of the Seamen's Union, I am sure would agree with that view too. He is a man well esteemed within Labor circles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister and his predecessors as Labor transport ministers have fooled around with ANL as if it were some sort of a plaything. Finally, in August of last year&mdash;I think it was 22 August&mdash;the minister sacked the board of ANL. All of those people on the board, including Mr Bolitho and Mr Geraghty and others, many of them distinguished people, were sacked without any explanation, without being offered a chance to discuss with the minister the reasons for concern. Since that time Australian taxpayers have lost a fortune. Since the government first announced its decision to privatise ANL in 1991, the Australian taxpayers have lost $146 million as a consequence of this government's fooling around with ANL. In order to satisfy concerns surrounding ANL and the Maritime Union of Australia, in addition to that $146 million an additional $20 million grant each year is now being paid under legislation that is actually in the other place at this very moment, grants to shipowners as part of a deal to try to satisfy those concerned about ANL and members of the Maritime Union of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it has cost us dearly: $116 million in operating losses from 1991 to April 1995; $14 million in operating losses from April of this year through to now; $816,000 paid to the three paid part-time directors of ANL that the Minister for Transport appointed&mdash;including his great mate the former Premier of New South Wales, his old boss Neville Wran. It was $301,000 collected by his old mate Neville Wran for two days work a week for 12 months&mdash;about 1.7 per cent of the value of the company paid to the minister's old mate. As my colleague the shadow minister for privatisation has pointed out in her address today, there is $15 million included in this legislation to cover contingencies related to the privatisation and sale of ANL, plus the $20 million in grants to shipowners that this government has prescribed in legislation which will go on and on and on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in the House we saw how the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) tried to relate government expenditure, in this case Western Australian government expenditure on the Marks Royal Commission of $4.5 million, to what it could do for hip replacements or appendix operations or whatever it may be. What would $146 million do if you wanted to turn it into terms such as the minister for health was trying to do yesterday in the House? Labor's incompetence has cost the people of Australia a great deal of money, and there is nobody else you can blame for the status of ANL today other than this current government. You cannot go back to years ago. Sure, they will make an attempt to do it, as they do with all things. If anything goes wrong in this country it is Henry Parkes's fault or Captain Cook's or Bob Menzies' fault, but the truth is&mdash;and all reasonable people know this&mdash;that there is no-one else to blame for the state that ANL is in today other than this current government. The current minister's performance in this regard is disgraceful. Look at his arbitrary sacking of the ANL board, his promises that he has made to people in the MUA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note what the former chairman of ANL pointed out in his report&mdash;I will not read it out, because it is a bit crude. But the last line of page three of his submission to the Senate inquiry just recently indicates that the minister told the Maritime Union of Australia that he was out to get the board of ANL. He sacked the board of ANL without any explanation. Indeed, the sacking of the board was the subject of some concern to the Auditor-General and the minister's sacking of the board based on the fact that `you could not give ANL away' was also the subject of concern in the Auditor-General's report into the ANL sale process. The minister saying that you could not give ANL away was a rather unusual way to describe a government business enterprise that he intended to sell. Who would be selling a motor car and saying, `Look, you couldn't give this thing away and yet I want you to buy it.' It is a most unusual style for selling things, you would have to say, and it further highlights the minister's incompetence in handling the sale of ANL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He made those comments, and he made his decision to sack the board of ANL, based on one valuation of ANL carried out by Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers when there were several other valuations around of ANL and assessments of its health that indicated that ANL had a positive value and, indeed, that ANL was a going business concern. The minister made his judgment based solely on one of those valuations of the company. He also refused to provide adequate information to the board about it, refused to discuss it with the board, and acted solely on the one report. In his investigation into the sale process of ANL, the Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conclusions put forward in the audit are supported by the evidence examined by ANAO&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Australian National Audit Office&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In essence, these conclusions are that the draft PWSB report should have been shown to the former ANL Board&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>They should have been shown. The minister did not show the report to the former board. The Auditor-General goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANAO considers that the tasks undertaken and the corresponding report prepared by PWSB could best be classed as a preliminary due diligence report and similar in nature to the 1992 Price Waterhouse Potter Warburg (PWPW) report.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The valuation of ANL contained in the PWSB Report was only one factor in a range of issues concerned in the Report . . . However, as with most such exercises, certain aspects of the PWSB valuation are open to question which does not suggest it should necessarily be preferred, even though it was the most up-to-date review of ANL's assets.</PARA>
<PARA>So what the Auditor-General was saying in his report into the investigation of the handling of the sale of ANL was that the basis upon which the minister made his decision to sack the board of ANL, to describe it as a business you could not give away, was not a fair way of doing it. It was not accurate. It was not right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, right through the whole of this exercise of assessing what has happened to ANL, you can see that the Minister for Transport has not acted in the public's interest. And one would have to ask: why is it? If the minister was acting in the public interest, why, having sacked the board of ANL, did he appoint his old mate Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and one other gentleman as paid part-time directors of ANL? What experience did Neville Wran have at running a shipping company? What experience did Malcolm Turnbull have in running a shipping company? They had none. I doubt they would have known anything about the maritime industry whatsoever at the point that they were being made chairman and directors of ANL, the government-owned business that ran a shipping business. It was an extraordinary appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that has to be asked, too, is what value the taxpayers got for the $816,000 that they paid to the three part-time directors of ANL appointed by the minister after he sacked the board of ANL? What value did they get? We started out with the new board being appointed and there were three potential buyers for ANL. Twelve months later, six months after we were told Mr Wran would be able to fix the problem, we ended up with one buyer that was totally rejected by the Maritime Union of Australia, an additional $24 million worth of operating losses, and a deteriorating valuation of ANL. And yet we were told that we could justify the appointments of these people, at such high levels of remuneration, solely on the basis that within six months they would solve the problem. Well, they did not solve the problem. Indeed, many would argue that the problem has now got worse, rather than better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of it is that the reason why the Minister for Transport acted in the way that he did was to avoid embarrassment on the floor of the ALP conference that took place in September last year. Members of this House will remember the controversy in the build-up to the ALP conference in September last year surrounding the privatisation of ANL. It was quite clear, to all objective observers, that the minister was not going to get his privatisation item, which was on the agenda of the conference, supported by the conference. Indeed, Senator Robert Ray was recorded as having remarked that the minister would not get double figures in support on the floor of the ALP conference when he moved the privatisation of ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, in order to avoid embarrassment, the minister acted in the way that he did. Suddenly he sacked the board of ANL. Suddenly he withdrew ANL from privatisation. He went out and said, `You couldn't give it away,' and implied that the former directors of ANL and the chairman of ANL were incompetent in the process. Then he appointed his mates to get their noses in the trough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you look at it, the truth of it was that the handling of ANL was done solely for party political purposes. It was designed to avoid embarrassment for the minister on the floor of the ALP conference. That is why the minister acted in the way he did. His methods have caused considerable concern. The former chairman of ANL in his submission to the Senate inquiry that took place last Friday indicated many areas of grave concern about the way the minister acted. The former chairman claimed that one of the major assets of ANL, Australian Stevedores, was sold to Jamieson Equity for $10 million or $11 million less than its true value. One of the principal assets of the company was sold cheaply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former chairman, Mr Bolitho, claims that the minister did not act in regard to his proper responsibilities as a minister of the Crown. The whole of the submission put forward by Mr Bolitho is littered with the most extraordinary claims levelled against LB, as he describes him, Laurie Brereton. Any other minister who did not have a hide as thick as a rhinoceros would be totally embarrassed by that report. Indeed, many other governments that were not as insensitive to proper ministerial responsibility as this one is would have required a minister to resign over the comments that have been made in the submission of the former chairman of ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the style of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) attacking Vince FitzGerald last week, anybody who says anything critical about the government is described in derogatory terms. In this case, poor old Bill Bolitho, according to Laurie Brereton, is just a bitter old man. Vince FitzGerald was described as getting out of bed every morning and sucking on a lemon when he criticised the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not listen to the message. It tries instead to shoot the messenger. If the message about ANL was listened to, if people listened to some of the concerns that even the member for Throsby has highlighted in this House today, then they would say it is quite clear that the Australian taxpayers have lost a fortune over the handling of ANL. They would say it is quite clear that this government has been incompetent in the way it has handled the sale of ANL. They would say that this government has acted to the advantage of a few of its mates at the expense of the many, and they would say that the people working for ANL have had their futures disadvantaged substantially as a consequence of this government's incompetent and dishonest handling of the sale and management of ANL. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going through some of the comments that you made about operating losses, yes, I can add up and other people can add up; it is quite easy to do it year by year. But I notice that you did not take into account that there were other abnormal incomes in a number of those years and that in some of those years dividends were paid. The officers advising obviously also can count. To put a different slant on the picture, it is like any of the large corporations: yes, they may have losses from time to time when operating, other factors come in and there are other sources of income, but do the whole bit when you put it together rather than select just part of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attacks by the member for Hume upon the member for Throsby and ANL are really just part of the old pattern. Members of the National Party and its predecessor, the Country Party, go through the motions of supporting Australian shipping, but in reality they are hammering the life out of Australian shipping&mdash;denigrating Australians who work on ships and denigrating people who work on the waterfront rather than setting about the difficult task of how we should improve that business, that industry, and make it more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relentless attacks upon ANL by the member for Hume in his role as shadow minister for transport are simply in line with the long-established tradition of the former Country Party. One has only to look at its performance in Australian shipping and especially ANL. We came into office in 1983 and inherited a shipping line, the Australian Shipping Commission, that was technically insolvent. The shipping line had been forced in 1977 to sell off its four major vessels and recharter them so that the proceeds of the sale could be added into the budget and reduce outlays for budgetary purposes in 1977-78, as I recall. That imposed a massive burden on the business. It was one of the factors the business was not able to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business was also forced to operate services for Country Party purposes, one to North Queensland and one to Darwin, that never made a dollar. In fact, $42 million of ANL's capital was lost on the North Queensland service alone. But it was seen to be politically desirable that Australian ships operate a service up to some of the North Queensland ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitude of the National Party and the Country Party has always been the same: of denigrating Australian seafarers and their role. We see now an opposition that is literally clapping its hands with glee. At last, they appear to have what they wanted, and that is the disposal of ANL, Australia's national line. But they have been captives for many decades of overseas interests and of primary interests. Australia's shipping industry has never developed as it should have, given that we are the fifth largest market in the world on a cargo distance carried basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clapping their hands at this time along with the National Party and the opposition are the foreign shipowners. Foreign shipowners cannot believe their luck. For decades they have been trying to wreck ANL.

As I go through the provisions of the bill, I want to raise some questions for further clarification. As we look through the provisions outlined by earlier speakers&mdash;and I will touch on some of them&mdash;I would like to see a greater clarification of those sections dealing with the appropriation of up to $15 million that may be necessary to meet any Commonwealth contribution required under the contract, or to cover the expenses of transferring the transferring items. It would be helpful if the detail of this provision was spelt out. What items are going to be covered? Under what conditions will financing be made available or expenses incurred? We need to know more about the appropriation of any funds required in respect of working capital for the current financial year for RetainCo or any former ANL companies transferred to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look at the third paragraph in the financial impact statement: the Commonwealth will continue to be exposed to potential liability in respect of $183 million of debt, mostly in the form of obligations under long-term ship leases which are to be transferred from ANL to RetainCo. I have a concern about officers who write that kind of material. Ship leases are normal commercial contracts; they are not debt. There would be rarely a company in this country that does not have a lease of one sort or another. It is not referred to in accounts as a debt. Ship charges and long-term leases are a potential liability, but they are not debt. Yet this goes to the flavour of the remarks I will make shortly&mdash;the quality of advice provided to governments and to decision makers on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a number of occasions in the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, I have raised the quality of advice provided to decision makers in respect of aviation safety and budgetary matters. I raise it here again today because it is an issue that goes to the very heart of public administration. Good decisions are based on good, comprehensive, accurate advice&mdash;advice that has some background, depth and knowledge. Good decisions are not based upon partisan or poor advice&mdash;advice that is inaccurate. The description of shipping leases as debt is not good advice neither to the government nor to this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need, in the course of this transaction, to ensure that Australia's interests in P&amp;O are fully protected. All associated with this process need to be vigilant to ensure that Australia's interests are given first priority. I suspect that some may not be aware of the ramifications of P&amp;O's proposals and the role in these arrangements. But I have first-hand experience of the utter arrogant attitude that some British shipowners have towards this government, regardless of colour, towards industry in this country and particularly towards officers in this country. I refer to one firm called Acta Ltd. In the government's interests and in Australia's interests, I ask: who is managing ANL's interests in the Australia-Europe conference trade? Who has that responsibility? What are the conditions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at what happens with the sale of those conference shares that go along with the sale of ANL to P&amp;O, they are very valuable acquisitions for P&amp;O. One might look at it and say, `That's not worth much. That trade is losing money. That hasn't got a value.' Let me tell you it has a great value, because Australia's participation in that trade, carrying our own exports to and our own imports from Europe, is determined not by Australia but by the other foreign shipowners in that conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a lamentable situation, but it is a situation which Australia has been locked into since about 1969 by contractual arrangements. They have changed from time to time, but it is extremely difficult to change them. They make those decisions. If I could quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lloyd's List Australia</EMPHASIS> of 11 September 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">P&amp;O will keep Australian National Line as a clear brand name in the market, but will merge the administration and marketing operations, P&amp;O managing director Richard Hein has told LLAW.</PARA>

<PARA>ANL's accounts&mdash;</PARA>

"We have very good direct trades, and we're not traditionally proponents of hub operations", said P&amp;O Containers chairman Peter Jollie.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us just think about that. The acquisition or the addition of ANL shares in those container trades to P&amp;O has the commercial result that almost a gross profit from that share becomes net profit. They are very handsome additions to P&amp;O's business, and something which they have been after for years. That is why the foreign shipping lines are clapping their hands with glee at the prospect of what is going through this parliament today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that, in about 1992-93, ANL sold off seven per cent of one of its Asia conference shares for about $10 million. I am not able, with the information that is available, to extrapolate that into how much the other conference shares are worth today, but it is enough for me to say that these conference shares are very valuable to P&amp;O. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to know who is managing ANL's current interests in the Australia-Europe conference trade&mdash;who looks after it for ANL&mdash;because we were faced with a situation where ANL was told that it could not withdraw from contracts which were disadvantageous to it in respect of the European trade. But, if it did, on 12 months notice, then it would have to enter into a covenant for three years not to operate between Australia and Europe. That is the height, and an indication, of the arrogance that can come from European shipping lines in respect of Australian services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about operational losses, but I want to mention something about final accounts. This is information that is available in the annual reports of the business, and they have been tabled in this parliament and audited by the Auditor-General year after year. Along with the foreign shipping lines and the opposition that are clapping their hands with glee today are some of the Sir Humphreys of the past in this place. Sir Humphrey is alive and well. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> is 95 per cent correct, but some of the Sir Humphreys&mdash;and some of the lesser Sir Humphreys who are around today&mdash;are also clapping their hands because they have always wanted Australia out of international shipping; they have always wanted Australia out of international aviation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In their policy, in the Sir Humphrey's policy, Australia should not be in it. It does not matter what the policy of the Liberal Party, the National Party or the Labor Party was or is; in their policy, the Sir Humphrey's policy, there is no role for Australia in those international aviation and shipping scenes. In fact, one senior official some years ago was able to say that, if other countries were silly enough to subsidise their shipping trades, we should take advantage of their stupidity and get out of shipping. That same policy is not postulated towards land based industries, but it is towards shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the systematic leaking of confidential information about ANL in the first half of last year, information that undermined that business seriously, that helped devalue that business seriously, it was information that could only have come from senior departmental levels here in Canberra. I should say that I do not think it was the Department of Transport. If you go through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> you can see the following: 9 March 1994, `Potential bidders cautious about ANL'; 10 March 1994, `Wharfies warn against ANL sale'; 14 March, `Canberra waters down ANL sale conditions'&mdash;which refers to the content of a cabinet submission, cabinet documents obtained by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>.

The headline `Rush to start ANL sale ahead of party talks' appeared on 21 March 1994, and the headline `Advisers likely to recommend against ANL break-up' appeared on 7 June 1994. I can go through all the other ones that have come up, but the effect is that anybody who was contemplating renewing freight contracts with ANL or entering into a freight contract with ANL was absolutely discouraged. That business saw a rapid departure of longstanding business and the prospect of new business because there was constant doubt being raised about its future&mdash;whether it would exist, where it would be and the fact that the board had gone.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If ever there was a case of the government being caught by its own incompetence, it has to be on ANL. This must surely go down as showing the risk inherent when you pander to special interest groups, put off making a decision and then get rushed into it by stitching up a grubby little deal. In other words, it is the risk inherent in how the ALP carries out the role of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANL was first listed to be sold in 1991, four years ago. In ANL's case, that is four disastrous financial years ago. Between 1991 and June 1994, ANL accrued further losses of $53.7 million&mdash;four years of wasted opportunity to turn the shipping line around under private control. As usual, the government went straight for the easy option of selling 49 per cent, but they found that was not viable. No-one would buy less than half a basket case, so they decided to sell the lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the unions and the ALP factions got into the act. The unions, of course, did not want to sell any of it. A new buyer might try to run it as a going concern and cut away some of the fat that the maritime unions had built up over generations of rorting and featherbedding. The Left did not want to sell it because they do not want to sell anything. They think the bureaucrats can run business better than business people themselves. These, of course, are the same people who wanted to protect the banks from competition and to allow the two airlines to continue anticompetitive practices at the expense of consumers. They thought it would be much better if ANL was to continue running large losses and place further strain on the taxpayers. In their view, it is better to spend money propping up a shipping fleet than on hospitals and education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process dragged on and on until we got to 1995. We had two buyers&mdash;a French company and the British company P&amp;O. The French dropped out, leaving only P&amp;O. This sent waves of concern through the maritime unions, as P&amp;O was known as a no-nonsense company. The maritime unions made it clear that they favoured the French company. When it was only P&amp;O left, out came all the old furphies once again: platitudes about foreign investment and that all that was needed was restructuring, et cetera&mdash;anything but sell. This put the government in a real bind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) had previously said that you could not give ANL away when in fact there had been a buyer. But then the ALP masters in the union movement said no. What to do? You can just see the Minister for Transport wondering how he could get out of this mess. After much discussion, when the government pretended it had a real say, the discussions were handed over to the real controlling parties, P&amp;O and the unions, because that's how a sale works&mdash;the buyer meets the people who control the assets to be sold. Since the maritime unions set maritime policy, including the sale of ANL, they met with P&amp;O. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government sat back, waiting for further instructions from the unions on the outcome of the discussions. One thing the government was prepared to do was spray a bit of taxpayers' money around to give it all a little nudge. After all, it is the preferred ALP solution: if you have a problem, throw some more taxpayers' money at it and hope it gets you past the next election date. At least you can tell everyone exactly how much money you are spending, even if you are not actually dealing with the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is not enough, they put up taxpayers' money to guarantee the liabilities of a shipping line with a disastrous financial history. In a nutshell, they have used taxpayers' money to underwrite an agreement between a foreign multinational and the Maritime Union, which is hardly well known for its cutting edge approach to reform and commercial practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry, but we cannot agree to support the ANL Sale Bill with the limited information available. We will not agree to the government using taxpayers' money and exposing the taxpayers to risk so that some grubby little deal can be cut to prevent the government looking completely ridiculous before the next election. The government's own rank incompetence got them into this. Taxpayers should not have to bail them out and foot the bill. If the government originally had the backbone to go through with their decision, instead of bowing and scraping to the plethora of vested interests, we would not be in this situation. ANL would have been sold long ago. The Auditor-General was in no doubt as to where the blame should go. For example, in his report he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A degree of uncertainty surrounding the objectives of the sale and the means of achieving the objectives would have aggravated any sale process.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the government did not know what they were doing or how they were doing it. They got themselves into it; they can get themselves out of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has tried many things. They have used taxpayers' funds to downsize crews, they have protected ANL coastal operations from any competition and they have done a deal on taxation of wages on shipping. After all this, ANL still runs at a loss. In a desperate attempt to pass the buck, they sacked the board and put in No. 1 ALP mate old Nifty, Neville Wran, on the job. Never one to keep his nose out of the taxpayer funded gravy train, old Nifty rode into the job to get it ready for sale. Their reward for doing such an excellent job in delaying the real action was $816,000 plus expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now Nifty has done such a good job that the government wants to have an appropriation in case the results are worse than expected. They want an extra $15 million appropriated, one of the reasons given being the potential for worse than expected operating results from ANL prior to the sale agreement. That's confidence for you, that's confidence ALP-style: give us 15 million bucks and she'll be right. But at least the main purpose of this exercise has been satisfied. Old Nifty and his sidekick Turnbull made a few quick bucks at taxpayers' expense on the way through and now the union and the buyer can slug it out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Maritime Union has already made it abundantly clear they are not likely to negotiate a solution. So we are back to square one. We still have a union saying no, a government too weak to do anything and, in all likelihood, a buyer that throws up their arms eventually and walks away. So what will happen then? I think it is fairly safe to make this prediction. The election will be too close for the government to stand up to its union masters and we will get another restructuring package. Once again the taxpayer will foot the bill. Once again the government will mutter all the platitudes about how they are serious about selling. We might even get the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wading into the fray again until Bill Kelty reminds him that the government is only a side player and his view is not required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst thing is that no-one should be surprised about any of this. It is par for the course for this government to fill their budget holes with asset sales but never really get anything done. That way you can do the same thing year after year. Already it looks like the Commonwealth Bank will fall into next financial year, but no worries&mdash;it has served the purpose of providing an artificial surplus for the financial year. That is the great thing about asset sales; you do not know it has failed until the end of the financial year and then you can make an earnest statement of intent about the next financial year. It has worked so well that between 1990-91 and 1994-95 the government offered $8 billion in asset sales but only delivered $3.7 billion in reality. They achieved less than half of the original target and now they expect us to believe they are going to sell $5.3 billion worth of assets in one year. That is now looking a bit unlikely, given the lower than expected returns of Qantas, the cancelling of the AIDC sale and now ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most ridiculous aspect of these asset sales is that they are labelled as part of some sort of deficit reduction and national savings strategy. We know that the real deficit is at least $8.2 billion, because the government tell us so in the back of the budget papers. As far as national savings go, that is simply nonsense. How does the government think the private sector acquires these assets? It does so by running down private savings. So the net addition to national savings is zero. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government knows this, but that does not stop them running around misleading the Australian people about the true state of affairs. Anybody who can stand there with a straight face and say that foreign debt does not impact on interest rates, despite their own budgetary papers, could tell you just about anything. But, even taking these factors into account, the ANL sale is special, because the government wants it to cost money. At least you could say that the asset sales that have been achieved have made money, but not ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government want to break new ground. They want an asset sale that increases spending appropriations. On top of that, there are exemptions for taxes and fees relating to the sale. That is the point that we are at. Pending union agreement, the government want to privatise a fleet of trading ships and all related infrastructure for a net gain of basically nothing. Indeed, with the guarantee, it may end up costing a great deal of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government want to set up another ANL experience called `RetainCo' to hold all the parts that you cannot give away. This name is, of course, short for `Retaining the debt, liabilities and risk for the taxpayer to just execute the minister's sloppy deal'. This is all because they did not have the backbone to proceed with the sale when it was first decided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, these appropriations are a story in themselves. For example, the government will be providing details on how they will offset the proposed spending. I will not hold my breath waiting for the details, because I am sure they have no intention of offsetting the new spending. That is the way it will go for a much vaunted election package. Senator Cook, who speaks in the Senate for the Treasurer (Mr Willis), believes that they can have all this new spending and not hurt the surplus. We know that the government does not believe there is scope for any cuts to spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It leaves only two options: either the surpluses will be dramatically reduced, or the government will lift taxes so that they will win the next election and pay for it after all that. It is the same routine we got prior to the last election. Make lots of promises and say that growth will pay for them or the budget surplus will be bigger than you thought. You then break your word and lift taxes. That is how this tax and spend government works. All spending is sacred, and tax is a vast abundant pool to be utilised wherever possible. Of course, the Prime Minister's lower tax commitment to the Australian people should not be allowed to get in the way of lifting taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps they will not lift taxes again. What then? They will simply reduce the surplus or reduce national savings. This will flow straight through into higher foreign debt. The ALP choice will be higher taxes and higher foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ALP approach stands in stark contrast to the approach that the coalition will adopt. When we say that we will privatise something, we will. We will not be held up by endless obstructions from special interest groups or bureaucratic wrangling or ministerial indecision. We will certainly not use the proceeds to wastefully pay for recurrent expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be used to pay for debt reduction to lower the crippling PDI burden that this government is working on Australia. We already pay $9.3 billion to financial markets rather than to education, health or roads. This is a chronic misuse of taxpayers' funds. It is ironic that the party which talks so much about social justice is happy to spend so much money on debt interest payments instead of making Australia a better place to live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of ANL has been a farce from day one. Through incompetence and a lack of will, the government has failed to get a relatively straightforward sale off the ground. The losses have continued to stack up, making the sale harder and harder. The government has failed to stand up to the unions and act in the national interest, preferring instead to play safe politics. Now it is back again asking the taxpayer to foot the bill. This is a perfect illustration of a government that is tired and no longer capable of making decisions in the national interest. They have lost the will to rule in the national interest and are now operating on the basis of damage control and grubby deals. It is the desire for power for their own sake, not for what you can do with it. This time they have given the game away. Australia has severe economic problems, and it is time for action, not scheming and empty words. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a meeting in Brisbane yesterday, 140 members actually resolved to have the current negotiations broken off. But, of course, that is not possible, as Paddy Crumlin explained to me when I spoke with him. There were great concerns expressed at meetings also in New South Wales. Yes, indeed, the meeting did resolve not to support a Labor government unless it resolved to guarantee a long-term commitment to the Australian National Line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just an industrial issue; it is an issue that concerns the whole country. Jennie George, the Secretary of the ACTU, said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 28 August:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unions and the ACTU have a firm view that we should keep ANL in Australian ownership and not sell it off to foreign interests. There are different views about the line's financial state. The union would constructively address those problems. Public feeling went beyond industrial concerns. It would be a sad day for Australia as an island continent to lose its national Australian-owned shipping line.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe one of the key points is that there is widespread concern in the community about these issues. It is not just a matter affecting the Maritime Union. That union represents the concerns of very many Australians. As Mr Homan has indicated, we are talking about major areas of our industry that would be beneficially affected, in terms of career and employment opportunities, by the decision to maintain our Australian shipping line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, one of the most positive aspects of this bill is that, if the negotiations are not successful, the government has committed itself to restructuring the line. The union is aware that it will involve some job losses, but it is more concerned that we maintain a presence in the international shipping industry. Kenneth Davidson said in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 2 September:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who blather about ANL inefficiency are really complaining about the reluctance of Australian seamen to accept Third World wages. The net cost to the balance of payments of about $7 million for every Australian vessel that becomes a foreign vessel may not appear to be much in the context of a $28 billion-a-year current account deficit.  . . .              . . .  . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the larger economic and strategic picture, which neither the Government nor its bureaucratic advisers considered, the ANL provided a good return for the net $9.6 million injection since 1988.</PARA>

<PARA>They are strong words from Mr Davidson. I have quoted him before in previous speeches on this issue. History is instructive in this matter. In the same article, Mr Davidson talks about the earlier history of our maritime industry. For the interest of honourable members I will quote Mr Davidson. He stated in that article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1923 when Stanley Bruce replaced Billy Hughes as Prime Minister of Australia, the Commonwealth Line had a fleet of some 54 ships in overseas trade. The fleet was initially composed of 26 enemy vessels confiscated at the outbreak of war and 15 ships bought in Britain in 1916 by Hughes after he had attended Imperial war talks with the British Cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on later in the article to state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The undermining of the line began in 1923 when Bruce was Treasurer . . . Bruce prepared a financial history of the line that turned an "actual gain of #2 million into a bookkeeping loss of nearly #3 million. He took this financial statement with him to the House, exclaimed over it in horror and when members had been sufficiently stampeded, brought in as the remedy an order to remove the fleet from parliamentary interference."</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">P&amp;O seems no less keen today than it was in the 1920s to get its hands on the government line.</PARA>
<PARA>I think there is a ring of familiarity with some of those historical accounts. Now, somewhat closer from an historical perspective, I want to quote from the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee hearing of 22 September 1995. This is evidence given by Mr William Bolitho, the former chairman of ANL. This passage refers to some comments made by my colleague the member for Shortland, who was very well regarded by people who understand the maritime industry when he was Minister for Transport. Mr Bolitho says on page 1:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I became chairman in 1983, ANL was bankrupt&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>In 1983&mdash;that was in the legacy of the Fraser government. The hypocrisy of the comments of the opposition speakers in this debate is outrageous. They are now going to oppose this bill, which at least is a constructive attempt to deal with some of the complexities. They are wringing their hands with glee because they are just dying to rip and tear at the infrastructure of this country for an ideological reason but with no real thought about the cost to the country. Mr Bolitho goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liabilities exceeded assets by at least $200 million, and possibly as much as $300 million, all of which would have been lost if the business had been closed down. It had unhedged debt in US dollars of around $600 million and was indeed at that time a basket case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister of the day, the Hon. Peter Morris, took the hard decision to trade out of this situation and in doing so has saved the government those hundreds of millions of dollars. This massive potential loss, more nearly equivalent to half a billion dollars today, was saved to the Commonwealth by the minister's actions and ANL's actions in support of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983 ANL debt to the Commonwealth as $110 million, all of which would have been lost if ANL had been allowed to go under. That $110 million was converted to equity, which helped the balance sheet on paper but provided no funds as the money was already lost in the effective bankruptcy of the organisation. At that time, ANL was given $50 million in cash&mdash;only $50 million, not the hundreds of millions set out in ministerial statements&mdash;and has since repaid loans of $20 million and paid dividends of $21 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Factual cash flow analysis, as against ministerial statements, shows that the net cash input into ANL between 1983 and 30 June 1994 is therefore $9.3 million only.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bolitho goes on to express concern about the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers report. He says that the report that the minister relied on was flawed. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now detail some of those flaws. The report was preliminary in nature. Its valuation of ANL was not to be preferred over other valuations known to government. It was not a complete and thorough analysis. Certain aspects of its valuations were open to question. The minister's own department was concerned that the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Bros report double discounted the value of ANL's major assets. Price Waterhouse-Salomon Bros did not seek any independent confirmation or verification of the reliability, accuracy and completeness of the information provided to them.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the selling of the stevedoring assets, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would appear to be no conceivable legal, commercial or prudential reasons for the haste in which ANL's stevedoring assets were sold. The only event on the horizon&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>And so he goes on. Obviously, Mr Bolitho has a particular point of view. I refer to these issues because one thing we do know is that Mr Bolitho has a great deal of credibility in the maritime industry in this country. It is very important that, as we as the government move to deal very constructively with these issues, we take account of the fact that, as the member for Shortland said, decisions that government make must be made on the best possible available advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vitally important when we are talking about the long-term welfare of this country&mdash;particularly job creation and our national integrity&mdash;that we do look at issues over and above some short-term bottom lines. There is no doubt that this government has been very responsible in dealing with the need to cut its deficit. Every time we try to do something constructive, members of the opposition, who display considerable cant on this issue, simply get up and block our legislation in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Berowra is obviously going to make a huge contribution to this debate. These are vital issues. We are talking about the integrity of our future involvement in the trade. I recall the member for Shortland asking who represents Australia at the Australia-European shipping conference. It is my understanding that P&amp;O have taken this role. On that vital run where we have been losing money, P&amp;O have been representing the ANL interests. It is very important to understand that the one thing we will retain by having a restructured ANL is a seat at international shipping conferences. This issue was referred to in an article by Steve Lewis in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 24 August. One of the issues that I am concerned about, as he reports it, is this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government is set to receive as little as $5 million&mdash;and could even end up paying out money&mdash;if it proceeds with the sale of shipping, ANL Ltd, to the British-based P&amp;O Group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">P&amp;O has also been unable to give guarantees that it will maintain all-Australian crews on ANL's six international trading vessels&mdash;a politically sensitive issue which could prove decisive . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If certain conditions were triggered&mdash;such as the Commonwealth having to meet certain lease payments&mdash;then the Government could end up paying out to get rid of ANL.</PARA>
<PARA>If we are looking to be fiscally responsible here, one would have to question whether that, in the end, is going to be to our benefit. We recognise that the restructuring could result in job losses. Indeed Mr Lewis comments on this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Restructuring of the ailing company would result in about 200 job losses, most of these white collar workers from the shipping line's head office in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, one positive outcome from the restructuring option is that it would leave Australia with a seat at the international shipping conference.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that we are a very small player, but it is better to be a small player. Thinking about our role in APEC and, on a different note, about our role at the women's conference in Beijing, we have demonstrated time and again that even as a small player we can be very constructive and strategic at the international level. That has also been proved regarding French nuclear testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we look at the proposal. As I said earlier, one of the most constructive aspects of this bill is that, if the negotiations between P&amp;O and the union are not successful, the option will lapse and the subsequent arrangements will be in place for a restructuring. None of these options are easy. There are no simple solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the one thing we can say&mdash;and I am proud to say it&mdash;is that this is a government that will consult with the representatives of the union movement. This is always trashed by the opposition. We know that they will not support the Accord. They will make sure that industrial arrangements in this country mean a downward trend for workers' wages and conditions. We know this because they are ideologically committed to it. No amount of soft talking by opposition spokespersons or the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) will pull the wool over the eyes of workers in this country. At the end of the day, they may have concerns about our role but they certainly won't have any truck with the sorts of policies that we know, though they are kept under wraps, are the real agenda of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With my colleagues I express serious concerns. I think it has been constructive to have this debate in the parliament. I certainly reinforce the fact that the unions are prepared to negotiate. Indeed, P&amp;O have admitted in their public statements that they know that if they have an agreement with the Maritime Union, the union will stick to that agreement. They know that the union will stand behind their words. I believe the union are being very responsible. I hope that the ministers involved will take heed of a number of issues when they are drawn to their attention as we continue through the processes involved in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the union and all those people in the community who have expressed concern about this issue to me. It is most important that a federal Labor government does listen to the concerns of the community. The Australian National Line is an icon, it is historically important and it is important to the economic future of our country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of the ANL is a legacy of disasters suffered by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). He has made a terrible mess ever since he took over responsibility for the ANL. Today in this parliament we have seen the disaster that he has suffered with the problem of noise generated by Sydney airport. The minister has got that wrong as well. This situation is an indication of the undue influence that the maritime union has on the sale of ANL and the union's desire to retain jobs at any expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The diminished capital value of ANL is a result of the ineptitude of the government and the minister and procrastination with the privatisation program since 1991. The ALP Left is totally opposed to the sale of ANL. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who is a very genuinely committed person, has clearly put the position of the ALP Left to this parliament. Even though ANL is suffering losses and has problems, the member for Throsby wants to retain it. No doubt there has been a lot of argument in the government's back rooms as to the relative positions of the ALP Left and the minister&mdash;who comes from the New South Wales Right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the value of ANL? A number of figures have been quoted during this debate. The range of figures, backed up by various valuations, has been remarkable. I leave it to honourable members to make their own assessment as to the value of ANL and the amount of its debts. After the potential sale of ANL to P&amp;O what is the government going to do with the remnants of the ANL shipping fleet? Those important questions are before the parliament this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1994 Minister Brereton told the parliament that selling ANL was out of the question. On that occasion we heard that famous statement: `You couldn't even give it away.' As a result of that statement, commercial operators and potential investors were not encouraged to put forward a bid for ANL. As it turned out, the minister may have been right because taxpayers are now faced with the prospect of literally paying money to enable a British shipping company, P&amp;O, to take ANL off the government's hands&mdash;or portions thereof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation has occurred because Minister Brereton has been reckless in his dealings with the board of ANL. We have also seen the spoiling tactics of the Maritime Union which would not allow the government or the minister to sell ANL.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need reform on the waterfront and in the shipping area, but the government has been unable to move because of its commitment to the Maritime Union.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth in average weekly ordinary time earnings for full-time adult employees has, in fact, increased by 0.3 per cent over the year to May 1995, and the real AWOTE for full-time adult employees has grown by 4.5 per cent since February 1993.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back over the decade, of course, real household disposable income per capita&mdash;which is just about the only sensible way of measuring what is actually happening to our community in terms of their earning-spending capacity&mdash;has increased by 20.9 per cent, and full-time adult average weekly total earnings over that period of time by 7.2 per cent in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So through all sources of income, including that related to wages, since we have been in office, you have seen substantial real increases available to the community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and can inform him and the House that, following the passage of the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill&mdash;a bill initiated, I might say, by the honourable member for Lowe&mdash;the curfew at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport will now be significantly strengthened. That bill will allow us to immediately tighten up on the shoulder period and cut the eligible weekly movements from the present 42 down to 35. In addition to that, of course, a regime requiring shoulder operations to be fully justified will now be established. If they cannot be fully justified they will have to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon completion of Sydney West airport, all shoulder movements, all curfew freight operations, will be relocated to that new airport. I might say that at Sydney West approaches and departures will be designed to meet strict environmental controls because we are determined to avoid residential areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But just how soon Sydney West airport can open is now in grave doubt as a result of the opposition leader's stated intention to block our airport leasing strategy. As the Minister for Finance could tell you, Sydney West's scheduled completion of 1999 is predicated on revenue raised under the leasing arrangements for Sydney airport. By delaying the Sydney West project, as inevitably will happen, the opposition will ensure that Sydney has just one&mdash;I repeat, one&mdash;horrifically congested airport operating at the time of the year 2000 Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inevitable congestion will see the airlines campaigning for more curfew dispensations and they will be campaigning for stub operations by propeller planes on the east-west runway, thereby lifting the capacity of the airport from its 80 to 85 to 90 to 95, and providing for 10 additional jumbo jets straight down the north-south corridor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You could not manage a chook raffle. That is the truth of the matter. Let us take the case of an award employee. Let us look at how much an award employee stands to lose. What we will see for an award employee about to take a new job is that it will be a case of take the contract or take the sack. If they say they want to stay under your award, what sort of an award system will it be? We have Jobsback and we have your commitment to an awards system that involves only four miserly minima&mdash;a minimum hourly rate of pay, two weeks or 10 days non-cumulative sick leave, four weeks annual leave and one year unpaid parental leave. That is what you have said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is fair to say that the shadow minister for industrial relations has said that he will examine some more minima. That is very good. That will be really reassuring to the electors! That will be a great confidence boost to the workers of Australia, coming in the same week in which you said in your advocacy of the Tweed Valley fruit pickers case that one of those four&mdash;namely, sick leave&mdash;should be traded off. So, if you are an award employee, you stand to have your award gutted. That is your stated policy. We do not know what you will do after you are elected, because we all remember the stated policy of the Kennett government as far as awards are concerned. They said there would not be any threat to awards. But, once elected, awards were immediately abolished. They are long gone. We should look at what is happening in Western Australia at the moment as a result of the antics of Graham Kierath.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are not under an award, if you are one of the poor individuals in that 20 per cent of the work force who change jobs each year, you will not have the option of an award. You will have a good choice: take the contract&mdash;whatever that might be&mdash;or take the sack. That is terrific. John Howard is on the record as saying that this is a matter that should be resolved in the marketplace. This is the law of the marketplace: not having any protections or any decent no disadvantage test, but a dummied up, phoney no disadvantage test as revealed two weeks ago by the shadow minister for industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said he believes in a no disadvantage test but it is not a no disadvantage test against your present circumstance; it is not a no disadvantage test against your award entitlements; it is not a no disadvantage test against the totality of your package. That is what you get if you are in enterprise bargaining under the program outlined by the shadow minister for industrial relations. In other words, it is a complete confidence trick that involves a trapdoor for the conditions and wages of every Australian working man and woman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, when the honourable member for Bennelong comes to the House today and asks whether people are going to be better off or worse off, in answer let me guarantee that the overwhelming majority of Australian workers will be infinitely worse off. But, at the same time, under the inept approach adopted by the shadow minister for industrial relations, there is bound to be a lack of any of the decent controls that the trade union movement and this government through the accord process have brought to this nation's economy over eight successive accords, down through the years since 1983.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They relate to the question of whether or not there ought to be some form of slowdown or related process in the government's sale of its airports threatened so recently by the Leader of the Opposition, in so far as Kingsford Smith is concerned. I was interested to find one such report amongst my files the other day. It comes from 22 June last year. It is from John Moore, the shadow minister for privatisation. On the government's privatisation, it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Privatisation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is of the airports&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">at risk through government delay. Further delays and doubts will make it increasingly difficult for the sale to realise the $2 billion the government is relying on to help it out of its budgetary problems. At the same time the interests of the aviation industry will be jeopardised, investment decisions will be put on hold, employment prospects diminished and business will continue to suffer.</PARA>
<PARA>So said the spokesperson on privatisation matters about a year ago on the processes that the government was going through to put the sales in place. It is a pity he did not have a chat to the Leader of the Opposition when he started saying things like, `Investment decisions will be put on hold, the aviation industry will be jeopardised, employment prospects diminished and business will continue to suffer.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the delightful things about being in this parliament over the last decade is for the odd time to have the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition spokespersons on privatisation stand up and say, `Although we could not sell whilst in office the Belconnen Mall, we nevertheless consider ourselves the experts in privatisation. Isn't it a shame that you fellas have been involved in the sale of those things? How much better it would have been for all the world if we had been managing those privatisation processes, no doubt in the same way as we attempted to manage the sale of the Belconnen Mall.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing could more reveal the poverty of your thinking on this, your absolute ineptitude on this, than for you to think for one minute that you could proceed with a sale in this area without selling Kingsford Smith first, the airport that would realise somewhere between 40 and 50 per cent of whatever is going to be the total amount of the sales. If you are not going to privatise a monopoly but privatise different airports around the place under different management, absolutely everybody who is interested in the privatisation process has to bid for the big banana, which happens to be Kingsford Smith. They have to do it. They do not actually have a choice on that. Their capacity, therefore, to bid for all the other airports is nil. Their capacity to realise a decent return on the other airports is nil without proceeding with Kingsford Smith first.</PARA>

Go and tell them that if you are not going to privatise a monopoly but have individual ownership around the airports it is a better idea to proceed with the other airports rather than Kingsford Smith first. That is yet another example of your crass opportunism based upon total policy ignorance. If ever there were a policy that was devised by an opposition long in opposition it happens to be this one. It shows the opposition is devoid of any comprehension of the market, devoid of any sensible notion or understanding of aviation policy, to arrive at the conclusion that it has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a product of two things. I do agree with the Minister for Transport when he says, `This is a policy basically about one of the Liberals' marginal seats, Bennelong.' I agree that that is probably at the back of the mind of the Leader of the Opposition, but I think it is a bit more than that. This is hubris. He is a bit ahead in the polls so he thinks he can do anything. It is this sort of arrogance which has not permitted him so far to put forward any policy matter to the public for debate. He just says, `Trust me.' But every now and then he likes to get up in this place and declare himself on something. If ever there were anything which showed, I suppose, a degree of political wisdom in you in not putting forward your policies, it is the response when you actually do do something, like come out and say, `We ought not to privatise Kingsford Smith first; we ought to privatise all the other airlines. We ought to hold that one out'&mdash;an utterly stupid piece of policy which is getting you into more and more trouble because it does not have a single supporter anywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other element of this is that it is such absolutely fatuous aviation policy. The opposition&mdash;including the Leader of the Opposition, as we have revealed time and again&mdash;was a cheerful exponent of the view that unless you had that parallel runway operating you did not have a safe operation. When it went through all the arguments about the lack of safe procedures at Sydney airport, the lack of safe procedure referred to the operations on a cross-wind runway and the north-south runway simultaneously. That is the safety issue you all discussed in 1989. That is why you said we all needed to do a parallel runway. That was your position then. There was no other safety issue involved at Sydney airport. There was no other operational problem of any substance at Sydney airport. It was that problem&mdash;the simultaneous operations on a cross-wind runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The runway operations were considered insufficiently safe in that regard for us to put a ban on the operation of international carriers, apart from Qantas, in that cross-wind road. That operated until the creation and opening of the parallel runway. There was no complaint from anyone at that time for the obvious reason that commonsense around the place said that was the only commonsense way you could do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that there is a parallel runway, you start to argue that it should be done simultaneously, knowing full well that the only sensible way you could do that&mdash;and even that would be unsafe&mdash;would be to operate off a stub and not the whole runway. It would be unsafe to operate off a stub. In operating off the stub, all you would do would be to charge another 10 jumbos an hour down the main two runways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a complaint for the Minister for Transport. My complaint is about the privatisation process. This is an act of pure vandalism and ignorance. It is vandalism of a sensible privatisation process. It puts absolutely in jeopardy the sale of Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and the other airports. It kills stone dead the timetable that Dean Brown had in place as far as Adelaide airport was concerned. We were in negotiations with Dean Brown as to how, in certain circumstances, that might be advanced. We were going through that process, but it has been killed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It puts back Badgerys Creek by at least six to 12 months. Badgerys Creek is completely dependent upon the capital being raised, effectively by the sale of that airport, to be able to get that going. If there is any ultimate solution or relief to the noise levels around Kingsford Smith as far as Sydneysiders are concerned, it is a substantial number of operations at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, under the state system, things are very different indeed. Workers on the minimum wage there are subject to the whims of one person. They are subject to the whims of Minister Kierath. He is the one person who decides on minimum wages in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now seen the performance of Graham Kierath in rejecting the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission's recommendation for an increase in the minimum wage for the worst off in the Western Australian system&mdash;the people on the very minimum. The recommendation solemnly made by the Western Australian IRC was, `Lift the minimum wage by $24.30 per week.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is $301.10 at the moment. The IRC said, `Lift it by $24.30.' What does Graham Kierath do? Does he accept the decision of the independent arbiter under the system which the Leader of the Opposition went to in Western Australia and said he was so proud of, the great success story in industrial relations, less than two short months ago? No. Graham Kierath sends it off and commissions another report. He was not prepared to accept the decision of the independent arbiter&mdash;the Western Australian IRC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does his hired help come back with? What did the people he sent off to do the job on the lowest paid, on the battlers, come back with? The hired help came back and said, `Let's cut it. Let's take it back to $16 per week. Let's rob those worst off in Western Australia, those workers at the very bottom of the tree, of $8.30 a week.' This is the system you are so proud of. The one guarantee that you get from Mr Kierath is that you will get what he says you will get. That means that if you are a full-time adult worker your yearly wage is $16,489, like it or lump it. That is it. That is all you get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How is it that the Western Australian industrial relations system allows the minister to fix wages? It is plainly outrageous. In the context of a sophisticated Australia, with decent standards of industrial relations, who could countenance such a system? This is not a role for ministers; this is a role for independent tribunals. That is the proper way. That is the decent way. I tell you, it has always been the Labor way. But it is certainly not the opposition's way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian IR system has been all about stripping away basic award conditions bit by bit, piece by piece, and dismantling it day after day until workers are on the bare basic minimum. That is what you are about. That is what you have always been about. People have had it illustrated for them so clearly through the antics of Graham Kierath in Western Australia today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take the House to the example of Ryan, a 19-year-old general hand working in a fast food outlet. He signed a Western Australian workplace agreement because he was told, `Sign here or you don't get the job. It is no job at all.' That is what happened under the Western Australian system. In comparison with the award, he was robbed to the tune of 28 per cent of his entitlements. That 19-year-old gets an hourly rate of $7.16 with no penalties for weekend work. They were ripped away by the conservatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the appropriate award, he was entitled to $10.27. That is $3.11 per hour more. That was ripped away by Graham Kierath, ripped away by the system that you say you are so proud of and that you were over there congratulating him for. I tell you what, I have a cartful of examples like Ryan and between now and the next election we will be bringing them out every day because the people of Australia need to know what they would be faced with under you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Liberal state governments and the opposition do not believe in enterprise bargaining&mdash;that is the truth of it&mdash;not real enterprise bargaining. For them, it is still individual contracts. That is the agenda. That is what they have always believed in. It is what they did in Victoria. It is what Kierath is moving to in Western Australia. It is what all of Australia would have to put up with if you were ever elected to the government benches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the great final safety net of a federal industrial relations system&mdash;the system that has had to accept 400,000 workers fleeing from the Graham Kieraths and fleeing from the Jeffrey Kennetts&mdash;would be wiped out because you would close off that avenue; you would close off that safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Western Australian IR system is, as I said, the system that J.W. Howard is so proud of. It is no coincidence that Jobsback's four miserly conditions are so similar to the Western Australian approach with its 10 days non-cumulative sick leave, unpaid maternity leave, four weeks annual leave and that lousy minimum hourly rate of pay. I might say that the federal opposition are not even as generous as Kierath. They do not even put in a weekly wage under their approach; it is an hourly wage&mdash;I won't say how much it is. Australians know one thing for sure; that is, under the opposition they will get nothing more than Western Australian workers are getting today, and that is absolutely nothing at all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lyons for his question because it gives me an opportunity to respond to the specific question that he asked and also to make a few observations about these issues of inequality, poverty and social justice that the opposition suddenly finds itself terribly concerned about. The Leader of the Opposition guffaws at the reference to income splitting. Members would be aware that as recently as December 1993 the Leader of the Opposition was openly espousing income splitting as a way of assisting families. As he has had a total policy vacuum in terms of specific policies on families since then one has to presume that his advocacy of that policy over the past 16 years continues to stand. He first advocated income splitting in 1979.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Oddly enough, by strange coincidence, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling has done some work on this and in a paper presented at a conference yesterday the impact of income splitting on income distribution was carefully analysed. The results basically confirm what we know already&mdash;but they enable us to quantify it&mdash;and that is the adverse and regressive impact income splitting would have on income distribution. According to the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, income splitting would cost $3.9 billion to implement in its unlimited form; it would be highly regressive in its incidence; 95 per cent of the benefits would go to the top 50 per cent of incomes; and 39 per cent of the benefits would go to the top 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot do this in a cost free way. Financing such a proposition&mdash;if you did it through adjusting marginal tax rates&mdash;would leave 1.7 million families better off; 4.2 million families, including singles, worse off; the bottom 70 per cent of income earners would be net losers; and only the top 30 per cent would be better off. Even when you try to limit the benefits to upper income earners, there is no way that the essential regressivity of this proposal can be avoided. It is a hugely expensive proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling contrasted and compared income splitting as a way of assisting families with the family payments system that this government has introduced and enormously strengthened in recent years. I wish to quote the centre's broad conclusions on this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two major federal programs already exist to provide assistance to dependent children&mdash;additional family payment and basic family payment. In section 6 of this paper we examined the impact of extra assistance provided through these programs and demonstrated how it can be either tightly or broadly targeted. These programs directed more assistance to families with dependent children, including sole parents, and the highest gains went to those of lower and middle income families in contrast to the outcomes of dependent child only income splitting.</PARA>
<PARA>Those opposite belong to the party that claims to be concerned about income distribution. Every single policy that the opposition has put forward&mdash;where you can actually get to grips with it in some concrete way&mdash;is highly regressive in its incidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make one point in response to the member for Kooyong, that great champion of the oppressed. The other day he made certain claims about the bottom 10 per cent of income earners. This exemplifies the point about the significance of the social wage and social transfers. At the time when we came into office, low income working families received no additional family assistance. We have introduced a highly targeted and efficient system of family assistance so that for each child up to the age of 13 we provide $67.20 per fortnight and for each child in the 13 to 15 age group we provide $94.10 per fortnight. That income supplement is tax free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you gross it up and convert it into its equivalent in a wage rise, it means that for a family with two children it is equivalent to a $125 per week wage rise. That is the consequence and effect of the government's family payment policies. Those enhancements have, of course, been delivered to sole parents as well as families on benefits and low income working families. They have been across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at what has been achieved under this government for those low income families and at the relativity of the income paid to such families&mdash;whether you look at it in real terms or against any of the accepted standard poverty lines&mdash;you see that the circumstance of all low income families has unambiguously improved, and improved substantially, since the coalition was in power.

It shows that Australia has one of the least unequal distributions of earnings in the developed world, following the Scandinavian countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see what that means in tangible terms. It means that the lowest 10 per cent of workers&mdash;whom the opposition claims to be concerned about&mdash;earn about 70 per cent of the median wage in Australia. Compare that with the situation in the UK, where the corresponding figure is 60 per cent. That is also the case in Japan. In Canada it is 44 per cent and in the United States it is 38 per cent.

It is a commitment of $215 million additional over the course of the next four years, $143 million of that coming from the Commonwealth, the remainder coming from the states, except Victoria. Every other state signed up on this package except Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is money that will go to capital improvements for teacher housing in remote areas; improving pre-school access; it will involve parents more in supporting the education of their children; it will improve access to the boarding allowance for people under the age of 16; and it will see a massive $146 million extra put into strategic initiatives matched dollar for dollar between the Commonwealth and the states. It is not just about money either; it is about identifying measurable outcomes and monitoring achievement against those outcomes so that we can make real improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, all states, except Victoria, signed up for that package yesterday. People might say that the problem is not as great in Victoria; in fact, the problem is worse in Victoria. In Victoria, only 22 per cent of Aboriginal kids finish year 12, which is 10 points below the national average in terms of participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday this attack by us on the Premier got him out to a doorstop where he said that what I was asserting in terms of Victoria's obligation was rubbish, that they in fact were spending more than $6.65 million and that the Commonwealth was spending only $3 million. Let me say that when the state government of Victoria submits its applications to the Commonwealth it is required to put forward the amount it spends. In June 1994 the documentation we received suggested it would be spending only $3.45 million this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If in fact they are spending the additional $3 million, maybe it is because they have had to find the money for the botched closing of the Northlands College or maybe it is because they have put a bit of extra money through the Koori open door education program&mdash;but it is Commonwealth money that contributes to that program as well. They are double counting the amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us give them the benefit of the doubt and say that there may be $6.65 million there. That certainly was not what we were told in June 1994; it was something like half of it. The Commonwealth contribution for Victoria this year is $18 million&mdash;a huge difference, and certainly quite the reverse of what the Premier of Victoria was asserting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he made this outrageous statement that they were spending twice as much as us, he said, in a throwaway, that I was putting forward deceitful information and that I should take some mouthwash to get rid of the lies. I must say, Mr Speaker, that maybe he was talking about mouthwash yesterday because he was more concerned about the closure of the toiletries counter at the Georges department store than he was about doing something for Aboriginal education. But, against the background of those figures, it is Jeff Kennett who needs the bottle of mouthwash. I might even make sure that he gets a little bottle of it to help him along the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact of the matter is that no Commonwealth recurrent services have been cut to Victorian Aboriginal people. In fact, if Victoria reaffirms its commitment, they should get more. The package that we announced yesterday means that they can get more for Victoria, but only if they do what the other states do&mdash;that is, contribute. I urge them to do so, and I hope that some of those people on your side of the House who share a concern about Aboriginal education urge him to do so as well.</PARA>

I would never want to underestimate the difficulties of maintaining standards of literacy in Australia, because literacy is fundamental to all other learning. There are, however, consistent exaggerations, from people who should know better, of the problems of literacy in Australia. My favourite example&mdash;until now&mdash;was the way in which the statement in the Crawford report that `as many as 25 per cent of children in some parts of Australia could have reading difficulties' was twisted into `25 per cent of all Australian children are illiterate'. We have heard that from members opposite. We heard it from the member for Goldstein way back when he actually had a policy to sell. It is a pity that that data from the Crawford report was twisted, when the real point of the member for Forde's report was that not one state kept data on the standards of literacy in their schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest to join in this sport is Professor Harry Messel, the winner of this year's ANZUS medal.

That was back in the 1950s and 1960s when the world was, of course, a different place; when Harry's mate Julius Sumner Miller was winning publicity for physics in Australia by demonstrating that you could put eggs into milk bottles by using the pressure of the air.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the member for Forde made her comments about the lack of data back in 1992, the states and the territories still do not provide data on literacy standards on a national basis. While we are having fruitful and useful discussions with the states and while we have provided funds for a national survey, there are as yet no national data. I am looking forward very soon to presenting a report on literacy teaching from the Australian Language and Literacy Council. I understand that one of the points it will make is that the evidence available on literacy in schools, such as the basic skills test in New South Wales primary schools, shows that standards are high. Perhaps what this episode shows is that Professor Messel has lost none of the tricks of publicity that were among some of his greatest contributions to science in Australia. I am not suggesting that publicising science is a contribution to be sneered at; what I am suggesting is that he is deploying those skills now to distract attention from the difficult situation he finds himself in at Bond University.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real benefits of that have the potential to be even greater. It is not an exaggeration to say that the world's most serious problem over the next century will be feeding itself and maintaining that food supply in a sustainable way forever. Let me give just three quick examples of the kind of work which ACIAR does to demonstrate the benefit to developing countries, Australia and the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first&mdash;I know this is of interest to the honourable member in his electorate&mdash;is the bee mite control project in Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya. This ACIAR project, in collaboration with the CSIRO Division of Entomology and the Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya authorities, has come up with a strategy for eradicating the Asian bee mite from European honey bees on the whole island of New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As many people will know, the European honey bee is the most effective producer of honey. But, in Papua New Guinea, the European bee mite has destroyed that bee, and it is spreading. Where is it spreading to? Naturally, across the Torres Strait. There is a real danger that this mite could get into Australia, as far as the electorate of Richmond, for example, and devastate our honey and packaged bee colony export industries. What does that mean in real money? It means $160 million per annum in honey production and $6 million per year in bee exports but, above all that, the devastation of crops which depend on bees for pollination. The annual production of those crops is worth over $1 billion per year to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is this whole project costing? A mere $320,000. It is now into the eradication phase. Its success will preserve the PNG honey industry, make possible the resurrection of the industry in Irian Jaya and remove the threat to the Australian industry. It is not a bad example&mdash;one of the very few&mdash;where the PNG and Irian Jaya authorities have worked together on this important project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a second example of small strategically placed expenditure having an enormous effect. Another $300,000 will be granted for the swap of citrus root stocks between Australia and China. Many citrus species are native to China. Under this scheme, 30 Australian lines were introduced into China and 77 were brought into Australia. That is one of the biggest influxes of citrus genetic material in the Western world since early this century. It will enable Australian and Chinese citrus growers to keep ahead of fungus, viruses and other diseases that attack the citrus industry of all countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A final, and very quick, example is an ACIAR project involving the University of New South Wales and Vanuatu. It has shown that it is more economically beneficial to landowners to conserve their rainforests than to sell them to logging interests. As a result, in May this year the Vanuatu forest authorities signed a lease agreement with local landowners to create Vanuatu's first nature protection reserve. That will protect a rare and valuable stand of Kauri trees from logging operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by inviting members in this place to make sure that, whenever they are travelling in Australia or overseas, they find out from my office what ACIAR projects they could see. I know it is an area that has very great bipartisan support. I know that the Leader of the National Party is always interested. His predecessor but three in Doug Anthony has been a very interested participant in ACIAR. Very valuable and interesting work is being done under ACIAR's auspices. It is something of which we should be proud and something from which we and the rest of the world benefit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you wanted an objective political assessment of Labor's term in office, you would have to say that over the years they have developed an expertise in running scare campaigns and lies which has really been unmatched in Australia's political history. I think of the 1987 election campaign when Prime Minister Hawke said that no child would live in poverty. It was very interesting that a question to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) today revealed that, disappointingly, a very large number of children are still living in poverty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1990 election campaign promise by the then Treasurer Keating was that he would not let there be a recession. Of course, who could forget the last election campaign, when the great lie was that they would not introduce a GST. But we are now paying more taxes than we would be paying if we had introduced a GST. Furthermore, the great l-i-e on that occasion was that you would get tax cuts from the Labor Party that were legislated for. As everybody remembers, those tax cuts never materialised. What surprises me this time is that the latest lie is not a lie of the quality that we have had in the past from these people. This really is a pathetic, crude, miserable, unimaginative, base, mean, dull, boring, cretinous, low-level lie, and no-one is going to believe it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amazing thing is that these people on the other side actually think that someone out there, except perhaps the truly deluded, is actually going to believe this lie. It contains the incredible arrogance that they could utter such a blatant lie and think they can actually get away with it. It is also a statement of Labor's desperation about the next campaign. As their basic lie about industrial relations is not getting through, today they have resorted to the ultimate lie, and they are being forced to pay for it with a set of advertisements around the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it shows is exactly what we predicted: as we go into the next election campaign, the Labor Party have nothing to run on. They have no record that is worth talking about. They have no plan for the future, no vision and no agenda to deal with Australia's problems. Therefore, they are left with only one thing: a scare campaign against the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it would be sensible to briefly look at an advertisement. In fact, they are very hard to find because there is only one of them. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) was doing an interview today and he could not actually find it in the paper when someone referred him to it. I spoke with him on a radio program this morning. I hit him with the simple question, `Barry, if I give you a guarantee now that under the award system you will lose no conditions, does that not make your advertisement a lie?' The tone of his voice indicated that even Barry knows it is a lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it is a lie. We have never seen so many lies fitted on one piece of paper. I counted 14. I should send it around to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). She could tell me how many lies per word there are. Let me just run through the basic lies. It says in the middle of the advertisement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under John Howard working conditions will be lost if your employer chooses.</PARA>
<PARA>There are actually two lies there. The first one is their favourite one, which is that you are going to be worse off and that your conditions are going to be reduced. That is lie No. 1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lie No. 2 is the part that says `if your employer chooses'. That is a really nasty little lie. They are saying that, with the changes we make, employers will unilaterally manipulate and exploit people. This is a real scare campaign that would frighten the daylights out of anybody. It is a lie, because our policy is very simple. If you are under an award, you can stay there. Obviously, you cannot lose anything just because your employer chooses. If you are under an award, that is a matter for the umpire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second policy position is that if you want to go to an agreement you can agree with your employer. In other words, it is just wrong to say that this would be a choice of your employer. No-one is suggesting a system of unilateralism where one party can dictate to the other. It is a complete nonsense, an absolute and outright lie. Once these guys get into the groove, the lies just flow one after the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next lie is `overtime rates of pay will be optional'. That is just a plain lie. If you are under the award and you have overtime, you keep it. It is as simple as that. If anything else happens it is because you agree and you agreed to go to an agreement. The implication is that agreements are rotten. In fact, their policy is to support people entering into agreements. The minister himself got up today and said, `If you want to, you can trade away various benefits and get a cash increase instead.' He actually said that it was not a bad idea if you wanted to do it. That is our policy. Your policy is not working. Our policy is to make it work. It is an absolute lie to say that overtime rates of pay will be optional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next lie, No. 4, is `penalty rates for working nights and weekends will disappear'. It is a complete lie. It is a complete, blatant and absolute lie. We have already given the guarantee: if you are under the award system and you like it, you can stay there. It is as simple as that. There is no more to it than that. This is a blatant lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Blatant lie No. 5 is that holiday leave loadings will be a thing of the past. That is just pathetic. Singo is off his brekkie or something. He has never run a lie as blatant and pathetic as that. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Howard" NAMEID="ZD4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who did write the ad?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Opposition members</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Laurie. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Laurie might have, and I thank members for their interjection. He had his list of scenarios. Theo appeared at question time today. It is interesting that the minister said the ad was prepared by the department, because it was Bill Kelty who was putting it out 10 days ago. Maybe an explanation for this is that it is just a rotten week because bureaucrats are not good at lying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No. 6 is that John Howard has endorsed the Western Australian Liberal legislation. He has not. Yes, of course we have said that we think we could have better workplaces so people could have higher pay if we made it easier for people to enter into agreements. We have said that. So what? It is a sensible thing to say. The government even says that about the federal legislation. The implication and the lie in this is that we are going to take Western Australia's policy and make it the coalition's policy. When you think of it, Minister, obviously it is a lie because we are not going to do it. I can tell you now that we are just not going to. They say those words are going to be in some contract but they will not be. It is not in our policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me demonstrate what a silly proposition it is. Under our constitution we have responsibility for certain aspects of industrial relations and the states have responsibility for others. Even if I liked everything they did in Queensland, I could not just transport it to the federal system anyway. It is just a nonsense to say we are going to have Western Australia's policy up here, that we are going to have Victoria's policy up here or that we are going to have the New South Wales policy up here. The fact is we are not going to have any of them holus bolus&mdash;none of them. It is just a complete nonsense, a stupid statement to make. It is a silly, pathetic little lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, if you look at the Western Australian legislation, the minister was referring to a minimum rate. We are not having a minimum rate like Western Australia, nothing like it. We have said that, if you go into an agreement, we are going to make sure there are certain minimum conditions. We are going to do that because, let us face it, some employers will do the wrong thing if given half a chance. We are not going to give them half a chance. Of course we are going to have a set of reasonable and fair minima. But the minimum rate of pay is going to be determined by the award hourly rate of pay. So to suggest that we are going to have a minimum wage like the government in Western Australia is just a complete nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lie No. 7&mdash;John Howard wants to transport working Australians back 100 years. I tell you what: not only is that a lie but if you went back 100 years do you know who you would meet? You would meet Paul Keating in a Lancashire cotton mill. He would be the union delegate and Jennie George would be his helper. Things would be a hell of a lot worse off under them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lie No. 8&mdash;strikes will increase. This is another favourite little lie of the Labor Party. Let us face it: there are fewer strikes today than there were 12 years ago. But that is not the issue. The issue is how we are doing compared to all the people we have to compete with. When you look at the way in which we are doing things&mdash;the number of strikes, bans, limitations and everything else we have here&mdash;the fact is we are not doing well at all. That is just one of the many things which contribute to the fact that we keep running up these massive debts. Our debt for this country is now $180 billion. So this issue is a complete lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lie No. 9&mdash;inflation will go up. They really are tongue-tied on this one. In one breath they say wages will be cut; in the next breath they say that we are going to have a wages explosion. Back in June and again on 20 September, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first thing, though, the coalition will do is scrap the accord. The next thing that will happen is you will get sporadic wage break-outs.</PARA>
<PARA>Wage break-outs&mdash;shock, horror! Then just one day later he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the policy of the opposition&mdash;to cut the wages of working Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>What a pleasure it was to see poor old confused `Laurie of lies', the minister, today answer that question. He was asked which one was true. One of them has to be untrue. One of them has to be a lie. He did not have the vaguest idea. Laurie is not so good when he gets off the basic lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lie No. 10 was that only interest rates will be available to stop it&mdash;that is, inflation. It is very interesting when you think about that one. This actually portrays Labor's attitude to economic management. Of course, it is an obvious lie. The truth of the matter is that interest rates under us will always be lower than they are under the Labor Party because we have a properly integrated economic package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting thing about this is that if there was an inflationary situation&mdash;and it is relevant because we do actually have some inflationary pressures under their existing wages system&mdash;their immediate mental response is that the only way to fix it is with interest rates. That is how they fixed it when we went into the 1990 recession. They still have not learnt the very basics of good economic management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lie No. 11&mdash;jobs will be at risk. I do find this a classic. One of the reasons we want to change the system is that not enough people in this country today have the chance of a job. It is a bit rich for you blokes to be saying that jobs will be at risk under us when you have given Australia the worst unemployment record since the Great Depression. What I find particularly irksome about your policy is that so many young people cannot get a job. I will never forget what Ted Evans, the Secretary to the Treasury, your chief adviser on how to run the economy, said. He said that the level of unemployment in Australia is a matter of choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that you people choose to keep a lot of our young people unemployed. It is an absolute lie to say that jobs will be at risk under us. One of the reasons we are prepared to take you on in relation to this issue is that if we had a better system a lot more people would have a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to lie No. 12&mdash;that John Howard wants to radically change Australia's employment arrangements. We certainly do want to make some important changes to Australia and the way in which it has been run. But the idea of a radical change is really said in this advertisement to try to frighten people. We are actually proposing that if you are under the award system you can stay there, but if you want to go to an agreement we want to make that easier. You say that our policy is really a radical one, as if that were to frighten people. Actually, our policy is just a commonsense policy which says that, when you go to an agreement, we are going to make it easier to do so. If we can tailor agreements to suit the circumstances of our business, that is going to be good for everybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister, your colleagues do not really deny that basic proposition. In fact, there are lots of statements on the public record where you agree with that proposition. But we all know you cannot implement a decent system because ultimately it puts in jeopardy the jobs of people like Bill Kelty and the trade union bosses who want to have a say in running every business. The fact is that that system does not work, which brings me to my penultimate point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sensitivity on the government's part, and the reason they run these lies, is that the one thing they do not want people to know is that, under the system they have been running and they want in the future, in fact people's real wages have declined. That is the truth. There is no argument about it. These are official statistics. The truth of the matter is people's wages have actually fallen. People who are in the low income bracket have been affected the most. These people opposite claim compassion but their policies have in fact reduced the incomes of the Australian families they claim to represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the ultimate hypocrisy in Australian politics. It is one reason why this is such an important issue. They will run all their lies, their silly scare campaign. We have a simple policy&mdash;a policy for higher wages. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Higgins (Mr Costello) tried to paint himself as the battlers' friend. What we now have is the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) trying to paint himself as the workers' friend. It is a bit rich when the member for Flinders gets up in this House and starts attacking the government for running scare campaigns, because when it comes to scare campaigns his record is second to none. Members only need to go back to the 1988 referendum campaign to see the sort of scare campaign that the member for Flinders ran. It would have made Goebbels blush. It is a bit rich for him to come into this House and start attacking the government in that regard because, frankly, he is the great architect of scare campaigns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To complete the triumvirate, it is not what the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), says that worries me or worries the workers; it is what he is thinking and what he will not say that is the real worry. The history of the election of conservative governments in recent times in this country&mdash;that is, in Victoria, Western Australia and that short-lived conservative government in New South Wales&mdash;proves that it was not what they were saying in the lead-up to those campaigns that the electorate had to worry about; it was what they actually did once they got in that they had to worry about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is offering a policy free zone. None of this array of shadow ministers has substance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is policy anorexia, as my friend the honourable member for Lalor says. The interesting thing is that they come into this House with a matter of public importance and even that is a furphy. A cursory examination of the statistics shows that it is a furphy. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) answered this in a question without notice on 22 August 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that the full-time adult average weekly earnings actually increased by 7.2 per cent between June 1983 and June 1995. That is the real figure measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Even that figure understates the real increase in the welfare of workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the increase in real wages, half the work force have superannuation entitlements that they previously did not have. Where did they come from? They came from a Labor government. The superannuation entitlements amount to an additional five per cent to six per cent being payable to workers as of today. That figure will be nine per cent by the year 2002. Another figure shows that real household disposable income per capita has actually increased by around 20 per cent under Labor. Real household disposable income has increased by 41.8 per cent under Labor. When expressed in current dollars, that equates to a real increase of $3,500 per household. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went and looked at my first speech in this House, which was just over five years ago, because I wanted to see whether anything had changed in relation to the opposition from that time. Nothing has changed. In my first speech, on 11 September 1990, I stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition's record on industrial relations is pathetic. </PARA>
<PARA>That was true then and it is true now. I went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its approach to industrial relations belongs in the Dark Ages. Confrontation rather than consultation is its strategy. It has no respect for the working men and women of Australia and has opposed every initiative designed to benefit those in the workplace. Through the dark years of the Fraser Government our opponents argued that workers' wages should not be indexed to offset the increased cost of living. Time after time at national wage case hearings the Fraser Government submitted that workers should not receive any increases. As inflation continued to soar, real wages kept diminishing.</PARA>
<PARA>That was their record. What was their record on unemployment? In December 1975 unemployment was 209,000. By the time they lost office in March 1983 it had risen to 625,000. What they left us with was double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and a reduction in real wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today an ACTU congress is being held in Melbourne. According to the AAP, the outgoing ACTU President, Martin Ferguson, said&mdash;and I think it is worth putting on the record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Opposition Leader John Howard and Industrial Relations spokesman Peter Reith were making a last-ditch attack on the whole system of awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said their purpose was clear, stark and deliberate: to drive unions from the workplace and drive wages down.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the opposition's approach to industrial relations. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ferguson said the conservative attack had come at a time when the number of industrial disputes was at an all-time low&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the member for Flinders conceded that in his speech&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and company profits were at an all-time high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unions and employers were more cooperative and enterprise bargaining had been embraced.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we have achieved in partnership with the union movement in the last 12 1/2 years. Why is the opposition making this an issue? It is poll driven. Their pollsters tell them that the blue-collar vote is a bit soft for Labor and that the battlers are a little bit worried about the Labor government's performance at the moment. So we have wolves in sheep's clothing running a scare campaign in an attempt to pick up the battlers' vote and blue-collar vote. That is what this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We used to see the member for Higgins everywhere. The member for Mayo (Mr Downer) and the member of Higgins were the dream team. One member hit the fence quickly. It only took 24 hours for him to be exposed to the public. His dream run lasted that long. Where is the member for Higgins now? He is the invisible man. He has gone missing. Why? The research of the pollsters for the Liberal Party shows that the member for Higgins, the battlers' friend, is not going too well in the community so he has taken a bit of a walk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the member for Flinders to come in here and pretend to be the workers' friend is absolute hypocrisy. What we need from the opposition is a policy then we can have a real debate. There is no policy because it is a policy free zone. The opposition is attempting to slide through to the next election. It will not work because the Australian electorate is more sophisticated than that and the polls are starting to turn around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is worth summarising what the accord has achieved for the Australian industrial relations scene, because the accord is the shining light that we as a Labor government can hold up not only to the Australian community but to the rest of the world. The conservative way of doing things is the way Jeff Kennett does it, the way Richard Court did it and the way John Fahey&mdash;remember him?&mdash;the ex-Premier of New South Wales did it. The New South Wales electorate did not forget him because before he was Premier&mdash;and bear in mind he was never elected into that position; he was appointed&mdash;he was the Minister for Industrial Relations. When it came to election time the workers in New South Wales did not forget him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what the accord has achieved for Australia. It has reduced industrial disputes to record low levels. In 1994, the lowest number of industrial disputes for a calendar year since 1940 was recorded. It has given workers and their families a better deal through lower taxes&mdash;and let us remember that&mdash;Medicare, family assistance measures and increased spending on child care, education and public housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accord has given Australian workers access to superannuation for the first time. It has increased household disposable income by 40 per cent since 1983, locked in low inflation and created almost two million new jobs between April 1993 and May 1995. Through the accord there has been a safer and fairer working environment, including better pay for women, and there have been measures to assist with family responsibilities. It has introduced a system of workplace bargaining, which is fair to workers and which allows companies to become internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Is it any wonder that John Prescott, one of the captains of industry, is out there praising the achievements of this Labor government&mdash;and that was within the last 48 hours. The accord has also made certain that all Australian workers have access to basic minimum entitlements in relation to minimum wages, parental leave, equal pay for work of equal value&mdash;a Labor government initiative&mdash;minimum redundancy standards and protection against unfair dismissal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The opposition way is a return to the Dark Ages&mdash;survival of the fittest. How would women go under that system? How would the disadvantaged in the community go under that system? How would migrants go under that system? The opposition's industrial relations package is simple. It can be summarised in one phrase: take the contract or take the sack. That is the opposition's industrial relations policy with no alternative and no protection in terms of an award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their record speaks for itself. You do not have to go back 12 1/2 years to what the Liberals were saying then; you only have to look at recent history. Before John Howard was Leader of the Opposition he was shadow minister for industrial relations. Who prepared Jobsback? John Howard. His fingerprints are all over it. So it is a bit hypocritical for the opposition to be lining up now as the workers' friend, as the battlers' friend, in their attempt to win the blue-collar vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I move around the electorate, what is obvious to me&mdash;and it is the message that I am getting back&mdash;is that the electorate have not embraced John Howard. They do not want confrontation; they do not want division; they do not want bosses standing over the workers and forcing them into pay cuts or the sack&mdash;and that is the alternative under the opposition. It is hypocritical for the opposition to be coming into this place with the biggest furphy of all when they say that there has been a decline in real wages. All statistics on the social wage and other benefits that have been introduced as a result of the accord need to be taken into consideration. Instead, what the opposition are doing is adding full-time employment and part-time employment and comparing apples with oranges. So we need to nail that lie. The statistics that the opposition are using relate to a high number of part-time workers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always interesting to follow the member for Banks (Mr Melham). He was fairly correct in a couple of assertions that he made this afternoon that a lot of what is going on at the moment in this place is poll driven. It is poll driven as far as the Labor Party is concerned because they realise&mdash;and Mick Young has told them&mdash;that their blue-collar workers at their core base have taken a walk. That is what the truck load and the litany of lies that they have been trotting around this week is all about. They are trying to get those blue-collar workers back into the fold. It is about trying to frighten them back into the fold&mdash;not to attract them back with positive talk but to try to frighten them back&mdash;because that is the way the Labor Party and the ACTU operate. That is the tribal way they have operated over the years. They scare the living daylights out of people for what they might lose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The matter of public importance this afternoon is about the fact that there has been a decline in real wages of Australian workers under Labor. What has Labor done for Australian workers over the past 12 years and over the past eight accords? They have achieved lower real average weekly incomes. They have seen the top 10 per cent of the working force getting richer whilst the bottom 10 per cent are getting poorer. The gap has broadened to something like $26,000 a year. Total average weekly earnings have fallen by 0.8 per cent since 1983. Employment conditions have decreased and real wages for women have declined. Today we heard that, in a study that has just been released, 11 per cent of the population is living in poverty and 590,000 children under 14 years of age are living in poverty. That is what has been achieved under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does Labor try to do? I was really surprised to see an ad in one of the Melbourne newspapers today, signed off by the President of the Australian Labor Party, the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), for whom I have a reasonable amount of respect. I did not think that he would put his name to a litany of lies that were printed in a newspaper that goes across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last couple of weeks, we have seen the Labor Party resorting to these tactics because they are not able to get their message across. People have switched off. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stands here for two days a week and he spends the rest of his time trotting around Australia trying to get his message across. But, as soon as people turn their radios on and they hear the Prime Minister on there trying to get the message across from the Labor government, they switch their radios off. That is why the Labor Party has got to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars of their members' money in putting paid advertisements in the newspapers in Australia today to try to get the message across. It is a deceitful message. It is probably not Labor Party members' money; it is probably money coming from the unions. We know how closely tied the unions are to the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard in a debate only a couple of weeks ago in this place the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) refer to the ALP as the `political wing of the ACTU' and that she is proud to be a member of the political wing of the ACTU. It is an absolute disgrace that, in the workplace in Australia today, working men and women are forced into paying membership dues, but they have no choice where that money ends up. It ends up with the Labor Party when it comes to campaign time in this country. The ACTU and the unions in Australia pour an absolute fortune into the coffers of the ALP to get their mates re-elected. The working men and women in Australia have no say in how their membership dues are spent, whether they support the ALP or not. That in itself is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other disgrace is that which has been perpetrated on the people in Australia by the Labor Party this week. They have got this fixation about opposition type negative campaigning. That is all they are capable of. They have all become Swanites or Smithites. The modern-day campaign, as far as this negative campaigning is concerned, is all about frightening average men and women in Australia with a truck load, a litany, of lies. The ad that appeared in the newspaper this morning was just unbelievable. As I said before, it was incredible to see the signature of the member for Lalor on the bottom of that particular truck load of lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at one of the things that were said in that ad: `John Howard wants to radically change Australia's employment arrangements'. The coalition wants Australians to get higher pay. The way to do this is to achieve higher productivity. That is something the Labor Party has not been able to achieve in 12 1/2 years in power. They have not been able to achieve higher real wages through higher productivity. Why? Because they are leg-roped to the ACTU and the Accord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that this has been recognised by one of their own&mdash;not a Liberal Party or a National Party apologist, but a card-carrying member of the Labor Party. Do you remember Jenny Mikakos&mdash;the former ALP candidate for Batman who made comments about Martin Ferguson? Martin Ferguson is the messiah of the left wing of the Labor Party. We have just heard the honourable member for Banks venerating and dribbling over what a great job Martin Ferguson has done. Jenny Mikakos does not agree. She said this of Martin Ferguson&mdash;and this quote could well apply to the entire ALP/ACTU movement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During his leadership, real wages and conditions of employment have been lowered&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>under the leadership of the leader of the ACTU, until today; we presume he is going to sit in this place after the next federal election as the member for Batman&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">especially for women, union coverage of the labour force has dropped . . . Is this the record of someone fighting for the "battlers"?</PARA>
<PARA>We know in this place that it is not. All those people that used to support the Labor Party know it is not. Those people who have taken a walk know it is not. I am sure Jenny is being paid off somehow by the ALP for dropping out of the preselection race, as was the brother of the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous)&mdash;Theo Theophanous. I just hope that wherever she re-emerges within ALP ranks she remains as honest about her colleagues as she has been on this occasion. I will repeat what she said. It deserves to go into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as many times as possible:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During his leadership&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the leadership of Martin Ferguson, the leader of the ACTU&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">real wages and conditions of employment have been lowered . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are debating today&mdash;the fact that in Australia real wages have been reduced. That was also evidenced in a report that was mentioned in this place last week. Earlier this year EPAC produced new statistics on earnings at the behest of the Prime Minister. These showed that in 1994 the lowest paid earners earned less in real terms than in 1983. In fact, they earned more in 1983 than in any of the Hawke-Keating years, bar one. Over the same period the earnings of the highest paid workers increased by almost 20 per cent. This is under the rule of a government that is supposed to represent the interests of working Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 12 countries compared in the OECD report from which the EPAC statistics were drawn, only three countries experienced a real fall in the wages of the bottom 10 per cent of workers&mdash;Australia, Canada and the USA. There it is. Under the leadership of the Labor Party, in close consultation with the ACTU, the wages of workers in Australia in real terms have been reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is why they are running all these Labor lies. We are going to get so much more of it. They are going to have to pay for it. The only way they will get this message across is if they continue to pay for it. If they send the Prime Minister out or if they send Dangerman out&mdash;the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton)&mdash;nobody listens. They are switching off. They are sick of listening to the lies that the Prime Minister has perpetrated on the Australian people over the last 12 years, particularly since the 1993 election. They lie when they say that there has been a 40 per cent increase in household income since 1983 and they repeat the lie even after the Prime Minister has been forced to repudiate that figure. But even then he continues to bandy it about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They lie when they say that we are going to do away with safety net wage increases. They lie when they say that we are going to force everyone onto contracts. They lie when they say the lower paid are better off under the Accord when, in fact, the lower paid are worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish where I started, and that is by asking what the Labor Party/ACTU has done for Australian workers over the past 12 years and over the past eight accords. They have achieved lower real average weekly incomes. They have seen the top 10 per cent getting richer and the bottom 10 per cent getting poorer. They have seen total average weekly earnings fall by 0.8 per cent. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I saw the subject of today's matter of public importance in the paper before us in the House this afternoon, I read it with some degree of incredulity. Why should that be the case? For the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) to come into this House and present a proposition which he would expect members of this place, informed as they are not only about the current state of the economy but also about the history of this country, to accept&mdash;that it is the Liberal Party of Australia which will come forth at the next election and offer policies that will benefit the incomes of the wage earners of Australia&mdash;would cause anyone in this place to approach the question with considerable incredulity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been in politics long enough to have seen what has happened in this country in recent years and to know the difference, in government, between the two major political parties. I was around during the years of the Fraser-Howard governments and I have been around during the years of the Hawke-Keating governments. I have seen the difference in approach between those two governments. I know what the facts of this debate are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any debate which revolves around statistics, as this debate does, inherently will throw up a number of conflicting areas. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), my colleague in this debate, has correctly drawn the attention of the House to the fact that the statistic which the honourable member for Flinders and his colleagues have principally relied on is not the appropriate statistic to use in this context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that average weekly earnings, taken in full-time earnings, have increased by some 7.2 per cent between June 1983 and the current date. That very much puts to rest any kind of argument about real wages under this government. When you look at a whole range of these topics, you have to examine not only that single, very blank and very clear statistic but also the history of the political parties in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that when the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) left office as Treasurer, he left this country in quite a state. He left the industrial relations policy in a condition of total failure. There was a wages explosion in 1981-82 which meant an 18 per cent increase in wages in the 12 months to September of that year. That meant there was a level of wage rises which was completely unsustainable. In real terms, there were big increases in inflation. By the time the Labor Party came into government we had double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. Indeed at that point, when Treasurer Howard left office, we had something like 10 or 11 per cent unemployment and about the same level of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those statistics are quite horrifying to anyone looking at the working conditions of ordinary Australians and contemplating that we might return to anything like those conditions. Over the last eight years the Accord has delivered a remarkable change in the way in which Australians perceive industrial relations and the way in which their working conditions have been improved. Of course, their household disposable income has risen dramatically during that period. Those are the things which matter to ordinary Australians who will be voting in this election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there have been dramatic falls in the level of industrial disputation. This has serious consequences for things like productivity in this country. Contrary to some of the arguments which have been put forward this afternoon, hourly labour productivity in the 12 years between June 1983 and June 1995 has increased by nearly 25 per cent. Labour productivity per person employed has increased by nearly 35 per cent and real unit labour costs have declined by 5.4 per cent because of the substantial increases in productivity&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that there have been real increases in wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Flinders, as he concluded his earlier discursion this afternoon, seemed to imply that issues such as the dramatic fall in the industrial disputes statistics&mdash;he did concede that they are very significant&mdash;can be dismissed on the basis that they do not matter because, if you compare Australia with other countries, you see that we are not doing so well. I am very happy to match the record of this government with those of many of our OECD partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member's argument does not hold up. The citizens of this country will look not so much at what other countries are doing&mdash;although those statistics are important&mdash;but at what we are doing now in terms of job growth. We are doing at least as well as our OECD neighbours are in terms of inflation and we are doing much better in terms of growth. I think we are second only&mdash;and this is twice in a row&mdash;to the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those statistics are very impressive and they are very real, but it is a fallacious argument to say that therefore the policies and the record of the opposition do not matter. People can think back 12 years to what this country was like when John Howard was Treasurer. They will remember those years very clearly if they were in the electorate and certainly if they were in the work force. People will want to compare not only the record of this country with its comparable OECD neighbours but the records of the two alternative governments which came before them: the government led by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), with a proven and clear record which can be demonstrated by those figures that my colleague and I have given this afternoon, and the very clear and unmistakable record of John Howard during his quite substantial period as Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was no one-term government in the Fraser years; it was a long, sustained period of Liberal government. It was a period in which they enjoyed substantial support in both chambers of this parliament. They could have achieved any policy change they wanted and, indeed, many radical policy reforms were adopted during that period. I will say one thing about that period, apart from its obvious failures: at least they were honest in coming out up-front and declaring what their policies were going to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who was the late Liberal leader who did that? The late John Hewson&mdash;late at least in his political career; I am sure he is enjoying a productive career in outside employment. In this place he was a failure, but he was a failure not because he declared his policies but because of those policies. The current Leader of the Opposition was obviously very close to this process. He was sitting back in the wings and observing it very astutely and he realised this classic mistake of oppositions that John Hewson had made: he had declared his policies too soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no way that John Howard was going to make that mistake. In listening to the honourable member for Flinders this afternoon I almost came to believe that there was a Liberal policy in this area out there and declared in full glorious detail. But really, after a few seconds, I shook myself awake and realised that that is far from the truth. Although the member for Flinders may talk as though there is a detailed Liberal policy on industrial relations and talk of detailed policies as though they really exist, I am afraid that those policies, if they exist at all, only exist in the minds of him and his leader. They are certainly not on the record in this place. They are certainly not on the record in the media and newspapers of this country. The public in this country is still asking where those policies are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to spend all my time on the negatives of the opposition's current situation. I am sure we will be able to do that in much more detail when those policies are before us. I think it is vital to turn now to the facts of the situation, because there are so many statistics out there that I am sure the public will want to hear just a few more of the accurate ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 12 years of this government we have seen real adult full-time wages rise significantly. We have seen inflation fall dramatically. We have seen productivity rise but unit labour costs decline because of that and, therefore, profit levels return to historic highs. We have seen household disposable income rise dramatically. We have seen unprecedented job growth in this country. We have seen GDP growth continue to rise year after year to the point where we now have nearly four years of uninterrupted GDP growth, giving the lie to the five minutes of economic sunshine line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those things have been very substantial and they have been accompanied by very substantial social wage conditions. That is where the jealousy of the opposition comes in. The opposition has been unable to deliver that Accord with the union movement, as it knows it will be unable to deliver it should it ever be in government. The opposition acknowledges through its jealousy in relation to this matter the real benefits of that Accord to the people of Australia. It has delivered substantial child-care cash rebates. It has delivered Medicare&mdash;a vital part of any social wage structure. It has delivered retention to year 12 in unprecedented numbers. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), who is at the table, is very much able to take some substantial credit for that. It has delivered family allowances into the hands of every low income earning family in this country. It has ensured that those lower income earners have made real and substantial gains in the 12 years that this government has been in office&mdash;as has the country's economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen low income larger families gain significantly in this process to the point where, indeed, when we compare them with other countries the lowest 10 per cent of workers earn about 70 per cent of the median wage in Australia compared with only 60 per cent in the United Kingdom and Japan, 44 per cent in Canada and 38 per cent in the United States. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the requested amendment be disagreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>The government does not accept the Senate request. The Senate proposes that the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill be amended by adding a clause, the effect of which being that the parental assets test is not to be applied when calculating the amount of Austudy to be paid to a person while the parent of the person holds a health care card. It is the policy of the government that as a general rule individuals and families should apply such income and assets they possess, other than the family home, to support themselves and their families before calling on the community for assistance through Commonwealth assistance programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, Austudy is subject to tests on the income and assets available to the student's family. It has been recognised by both the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in its 1991 report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Student financial assistance</EMPHASIS> and more recently by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Austudy</EMPHASIS> of June of this year that taxable income alone is not an adequate measure of an individual's financial means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community expects that families with wealth in the form of assets should draw upon that wealth for their children's education before calling on the community for support. In most cases, the health care card is granted to a person who has already met a Commonwealth assets test under social security legislation&mdash;for example, an unemployed parent getting jobsearch allowance or a farmer getting a drought relief payment. These people will have met the assets test pertaining to that payment in order to get a health care card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health care card is also available to a smaller number of families on the basis of low or reduced income, tested over any four-week period. Cards issued on this basis are not subject to any assets testing whatsoever. The effect of the Senate's request for amendment would be to extend Austudy to all families who get a health care card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beneficiaries of this amendment would not be needy families, those with modest assets or those who get a jobsearch allowance or a similar payment. It would be families who have debt free assets, excluding the family home, in excess of the $375,000 allowed for Austudy purposes and who, because of seasonal income or the ability to choose the interval at which their income is drawn down, can get the health care card on the basis of a period of low income. Finally, I should say to the House that Senator Hill's amendment carries a recurrent cost in excess of $10 million per year. The government, for these reasons, cannot agree to the Senate's request. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to question time, I was saying that by August 1994 the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) had shelved the privatisation plan after selectively releasing a valuation from the due diligence report by Price Waterhouse and Salomon Brothers which suggested that ANL had a negative value. According to the minister, the value of ANL was between negative $74.8 million and negative $117.8 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it has since been claimed by the highly regarded, and well spoken about, former Chairman of ANL Mr Bill Bolitho&mdash;other members of the House have spoken about him&mdash;that the estimate undervalued ANL by between $175 million and $218 million. A joint Price Waterhouse-Potter Warburg study in 1992 put the value of ANL at anywhere up to $179 million as a going concern. Another valuation, performed by Arthur Andersen, put the figure at $30 million. So we have a fair bit of conflict on these valuations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former chairman Bill Bolitho recently told the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANL was not bankrupt in August 1994 when the minister replaced the board and made his remarkable `couldn't give it away' statements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which I have referred to before. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although certainly undercapitalised by deliberate government policy and operating in a difficult market environment, it was a going concern with net assets in excess of $100 million. It did, however, have difficulties sufficient to cause me grave concern. Those difficulties were fairly and squarely of the minister's making and were put to him as such in writing on a number of occasions without result.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the former chairman's position. He is a man who understands shipping and is very highly regarded in transport and shipping circles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the minister chose to selectively publicise the one valuation which put ANL's net worth at a three-figure negative sum. To the amazement of virtually every observer and members on this side of the House, Minister Brereton deliberately undersold the value of the very asset that he was supposed to be grooming and preparing for sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former chairman pointed out to the Senate committee that the board of ANL had done quite a reasonable job in repairing its finances, only to have the minister completely undermine it. He reported that when he became chairman in 1983 ANL was bankrupt with a debt of some $600 million. He went on to say that ANL inherited 33 ships, a large proportion of which were engaged in loss-making activities and were there only for political purposes. He mentioned the carriage of beer to Darwin, which other members of the House have referred to, the North Queensland operations, where there are a number of marginal government seats, and the operation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Princess of Tasmania</EMPHASIS>&mdash;all very questionable commercial operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average life of the ships was over 20 years&mdash;currently the average life of commercial seagoing vessels is in the range of 16 years&mdash;they were fuel inefficient and, more importantly, they had manning levels of over 30 seamen. Today&mdash;this is a major turnaround&mdash;the ANL fleet has an average life of eight years, with crews of 18 to 19. I compliment Mr Bolitho on that quite remarkable turnaround of the fleet and its operational capacity. So the ANL board by any standard had done some good work to rationalise the operation and make it more commercially viable, given difficult trading conditions and directions from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the minister undermined all that good work by telling the parliament, the shipping industry and the people of Australia that ANL was worthless. The ANL board was not shown the full due diligence report from which the minister had plucked the negative valuation figures. The former chairman Bill Bolitho again told the Senate committee into the ANL fiasco that Minister Brereton had engaged in a `reckless' political campaign to drive down the value of ANL and discredit the former board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Mr Bolitho, the asset sales force, within the Department of Finance, had been working on a clandestine policy in respect of the ANL sale which was not known to the board. What a remarkable situation. You had the Department of Finance working without telling the board what they were doing. He told the Senate inquiry that ANL had worked dutifully within the guidelines set by the government, unaware that those guidelines were spurious and clashed with the government's true hidden objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, Minister Brereton used the opportunity to sack the board, replacing them with an interim board, headed by the former New South Wales Labor Premier Neville Wran. What would the former Premier of New South Wales, Mr Neville Wran, know about shipping and all that transport area compared with the former chairman, Bill Bolitho, who had had a lifetime in the industry, was highly respected and whose activities could not be questioned? However, the government appointed one of their mates to be in charge of the board. In Mr Bolitho's evidence to the Senate finance and public administration committee, he pointed to anomalies in the valuation of ANL after the new board took over. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Five months after Minister Brereton declared that ANL was worthless and you could not give it away, the new board of ANL signed its accounts as a going concern with net assets of $26 million.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These two positions are mutually exclusive. Either the new board of ANL was massively in error in January 1995 when they signed the accounts as at June 30, or the minister was massively in error in making the statements that he did.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have a conflict between the appointed chairman and the minister clearly on the public record. Only five months after Laurie Brereton said that you could not give ANL away, the interim board which he appointed was signing off the annual report which put the company's net worth at $26 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bolitho also pointed to the flaws in the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers valuation, which the minister, Laurie Brereton, relied upon in saying the ANL had a negative value. He said that the minister's own department was concerned that the Salomon Brothers report had double discounted the value of ANL's major assets. Secondly, Salomon Brothers did not seek an independent confirmation of the accuracy of the information provided to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Premier Wran was to receive $151,000 for six months work, while his friend and lawyer Malcolm Turnbull and lawyer John Spark were to receive $120,000 each for work that the board had been carrying on for reasonable remuneration. Further, ex-Premier Neville Wran asked for a three-month extension to carry on his work, followed by a further one-month extension, followed by yet another two-month extension to try to solve all these problems. So two months work grew into six and by 22 August 1995 the part-time board had cost $816,000, as well as travel allowances worth as much as an alleged $900 per night. All this was delaying the sale process at an ultimate cost to the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the sale of ANL was first announced in 1991, ANL has incurred $116 million in operating losses&mdash;a cost that will eventually be borne by the Australian taxpayer. Then there was the $17 million which shipowners lost in the course of the national waterfront strike last September, which the Maritime Union brought on because of their concerns about ANL's future. All members in this House would be aware of that particular political strike which did not help ANL's future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wider costs to the Australian economy from that six-day strike have been conservatively put at about $30 million. Of course, the strike on the nation's wharves ended only when the government offered the union a bribe&mdash;or a concession, to put it in polite terms&mdash;of $20 million of tax concessions to the shipping industry, including PAYE tax exemptions for Australian seafarers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Offsetting all that, the government now has an offer of $19.5 million from P&amp;O for the part of ANL which P&amp;O are prepared to buy. Overall, the equation reads that the taxpayers of Australia have lost something like $100 million since 1991 when the sale of ANL was first flagged. That figure would be a lot worse except for the sale of ANL's 25 per cent holding in Australian Stevedores on 9 September 1994 at about $288 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even that transaction was not without complication&mdash;the price realised on the sale was $15 million less than the value of the shareholding estimated by ANL. Furthermore, Chris Corrigan's Jamison Equity financed the purchase of Australian Stevedores with a loan from ANL. What a remarkable situation! You buy a share in a company and then finance it with a loan from a government instrumentality. Reportedly, there was interest or charges on the loan, and no security was given until three days after the transaction actually took place. For those three days, the Commonwealth was exposed to a risk of $16.8 million with no security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Laura Tingle, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS> last week, Minister Laurie Brereton hurriedly approved the deal over a mobile phone after attending a funeral. As Bill Bolitho said to the Senate committee again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would appear to be no conceivable legal, commercial or prudential reasons for the haste in which ANL's stevedoring assets were sold. The only event on the horizon likely to produce such pressure was the meeting three days later between the Prime Minister, ministers of the crown, the Maritime Union of Australia and the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA>What a surprising coincidence. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this was the reason, as I believe it was, then the hasty and slipshod way the sale was made and risks were taken with public assets for political expediency.</PARA>
<PARA>So the bottom line of this fiasco is that taxpayers will fork out $100 million because the government has consistently bungled the sale process over the last four years. But even with a shipping line losing $2 million a month, the government has yet again postponed the sale because the Maritime Union of Australia threatened another national waterfront strike if they did not get their way of maintaining Australian crews on ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the wharfies and ratings were threatening to hold the nation to ransom unless the government caved in to their demands. The result is that we are witnessing the comical situation where a potential buyer of ANL must negotiate with a militant trade union which will continually threaten to close down the nation's ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have expected that a potential sale would be negotiated between the parties to the transaction&mdash;as usually takes place in the commercial sphere in Australia. But not so with the Labor Party government. Apparently, the principal negotiating party to this deal is the Maritime Union of Australia. The interests of ordinary Australian taxpayers appear to be of secondary importance in this particular deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in the event that the sale does proceed, the Commonwealth will be left with potential exposure to liabilities totalling $183 million which P&amp;O do not want. I concede that the figure of $183 million is somewhat questionable as to what those liabilities consist of&mdash;whether they are ships under hire. However, it is quite clear that P&amp;O wish to take a portion of ANL and leave the unprofitable portion for the government to remain in charge of. The entity left will be called RetainCo which may yet require a further injection of Commonwealth funds. As I understand it, this entity will lease five vessels from financiers, which will then be subleased to other shipping companies that will earn some income from the subleases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">P&amp;O will receive the five vessels currently owned by ANL, along with two rented vessels, one leased vessel and 4,750 leased containers. The sale to P&amp;O will exclude the bulk of the debts which ANL currently has. It appears that the sale, in fact, is not a sale at all. Meanwhile, the unions and P&amp;O have until 31 October to reach an agreement on the terms of the sale. But already one of the unions involved, the Australian Service Union, has refused to cooperate with the new board's plan for a reorganisation of the Melbourne office ahead of the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For its part, the MUA have made it clear that they will oppose the sale of ANL to P&amp;O unless they receive ironclad assurances that the ships will remain Australian flagged and crewed. That is their position, and they are interfering with a major commercial arrangement between the government and P&amp;O. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Realistically, P&amp;O can promise to maintain Australian crews only as long as they are commercially viable. That is understandable. P&amp;O has recently teamed up with three other operators to enter the trans-Pacific container business and it is anticipated that ANL ships will operate with P&amp;O in that venture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I close by quoting Mr Alan Wood, who made this observation in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> about the influence of the Maritime Union:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Behind this situation is what amounts to a national extortion racket. The MUA runs a closed union shop in the maritime industry, protected by the Government and its industrial legislation. As a result of its monopoly position as a seller of labour, the MUA is able to extract wages and employment conditions well above their true market value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employers have no choice but to pay up, although since they could pass the cost on in higher port and shipping charges, they have not complained much until recent years, when there has been more pressure from customers as a result of micro-economic reform elsewhere in the economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ANL Sale Bill that we are considering at present represents in a sense the culmination of a series of developments that have taken place since the government's decision to sell a substantial part of ANL Ltd, as announced in the 1991-92 budget. In March of 1994, ministers announced that a due diligence process would be commenced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this debate, not only within the parliament but in the wider community, there have been many claims and counterclaims and many accusations and counteraccusations. Understandably, there has been a lot of partisan politics involved, giving people often an opportunity to express their prejudices about public sector operations and about what some people allege to be examples of inefficiency. The amount of material that has been made available is so high you could not jump over it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether many people have been able to closely analyse the elements of this question. The member who preceded me, the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), quite correctly drew attention to some of the contrasting valuations of ANL&mdash;contrasting valuations that defy explanation simply on the basis of the valuations which have been provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that some of those valuations have been made on the basis of a forced sale and that the valuation has been related to that type of approach or provision. Other valuations have been undertaken by the board itself, valuations which were undertaken in that due diligence process, valuations which were undertaken by the Auditor-General. In fact, the Auditor-General, in December 1994, found that the ANL had a net worth of $127 million as at June 1994&mdash;not the negative values of varying levels which have often been asserted by others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The differences in the valuation of ANL have been raised by a number of people, including Bob Walker, the professor of accounting at the University of New South Wales. Professor Walker has explained some of those differences as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers asking "how could ANL's audited $158 million shareholders' equity turn into negative $118 million in just 10 months&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>what an appropriate question&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . (should realise) that there's a difference between a balance sheet prepared on a `going concern' basis and one prepared on a `forced sale' basis".</PARA>
<PARA>Of course there is. People have never been too willing to come forward to explain the bases upon which those various valuations have been made. We are left to try to interpret them ourselves. Professor Walker said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Plainly, the report from Price Waterhouse and Salomon Bros, which had been commissioned by the Finance Department asset sales task force, valued ANL's assets and liabilities on the basis of a forced sale.</PARA>
<PARA>We had in 1992-93 an estimated value of ANL of $150 million, but the due diligence valuation suggested that the valuation could have been somewhere between negative $70 million and negative $180 million. There is little credit in this whole exercise on the part of those people who have been advancing contrasting valuations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that, as far as the government is concerned, there has been a collective decision made that the ANL, given certain circumstances, will be sold. That is not a proposition which I personally support, but I believe in collective decision making, I believe in the discipline of parties and I believe that you take the good with the bad. If a decision is made by the federal parliamentary Labor Party caucus, as has been made, I believe that I should be subject to the discipline of the caucus, and I will be voting for this legislation. </PARA>

Meanwhile, legislation will be put through the parliament to support the sale. Of course, that is what we are in the process of doing now. But the act will not be proclaimed unless the industrial agreement is achieved.

I had difficulty in supporting the sale of other major national corporations such as the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and so on, but, while a federal government retains through its control of the Reserve Bank an appropriate level of surveillance of prudential requirements over the whole of the banking system, perhaps it is not so important for a national government to remain directly involved in the process of banking.

It is probably not among the best performers&mdash;and all of that confusing detail and evidence which has been provided from so many different sources would indicate the degree of confusion that exists&mdash;for a whole range of reasons.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you for your forbearance, Mr Deputy Speaker. In 1990-91 the total freight on imports and exports was in excess of $4 billion. That increased progressively until, in 1994-95, it was just under $6,000 million. In 1990-91 the current account deficit was just over $16 billion and in 1994-95 it was in excess of $26 billion. Those freight costs, as a proportion of our current account deficit, represented 26 per cent in 1990-91, 38 per cent in 1991-92, 34 per cent in 1992-93, 32 per cent in 1993-94 and 22 per cent in 1994-95.

He said later that same week, `Given its past history, it is unlikely that even a restructured ANL would be commercially viable when exposed to the chill winds of open competition.' During the same period last year, the opposition transport spokesman, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), said, `If, in fact, ANL is destructured and sold off in that fashion'&mdash;he was referring to its possible piecemeal sale&mdash;`the Australian taxpayers will have lost a good deal in the process and stand to take a $100 million bath.'

I do not make those observations by way of criticism of the concerns and the way in which those concerns were expressed but to indicate that there has not been unanimity on the part of the opposition any more than there has been unanimity on the part of the government.

I mentioned on one previous occasion that when I was a kid at school&mdash;like so many other members in this parliament&mdash;the Commonwealth Bank used to send tellers out to the schools. They would sit on the opposite side of a desk with those young school pupils and collect their pennies to go into their banking accounts.

When it left the control and ownership of the government, it became just as avaricious as the rest, just as predatory on its customers, just as uncaring about the poor so that those on the lowest incomes, the smallest savers in the community, were to be charged fees on their accounts. To anyone who suggests to me that the market is sufficient to ensure that those excesses of capitalism, which I do not find attractive, are best controlled by the market, I say: I think not.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that, as an Australian representing a coastal constituency, I am very concerned about the way that coastal shipping in Australia has come to the sad and sorry state that it is in at the present time. As a maritime nation, we really ought to have many more coastal steamers operating productively, efficiently and competitively around our coastline. We also ought to encourage a tourism industry around our coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it is sad that we find that ANL is in its current situation and, although we are an island continent&mdash;as was pointed out by the honourable member for Charlton&mdash;that we do not have an effective Australian shipping industry at the present time. At a time when all Australians quite rightly are concerned about the environment&mdash;and we have come to appreciate that we hold our nation's environment in trust for future generations&mdash;using ships is surely the cleanest means of transporting goods around the Australian coastline, rather than using superhighways or forever seeking to transport goods over land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, through the ineptness of ANL and governments over the years allowing unproductive activities, unproductive conditions, and uncompetitive practices to grow up in ANL, we do not have a viable coastal shipping arrangement; we do not have a viable coastal shipping line. The minister, in effect, last year said, `You couldn't give ANL away.' You will be interested to know how the Commonwealth government first became involved in shipping. During the First World War a number of enemy vessels were seized as war prizes and, ironically, if those war prizes had not been taken, obviously the great lemon that ANL has become would not be a problem confronting the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1991, the government has been seeking to dispose of ANL. It has appeared in every budget since 1991. ANL is still there and is still making losses. We find that there has been very great concern expressed by Australians right across the nation over the government's handling of ANL. On 8 December 1994, the Senate put a reference in response to those community concerns to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee. That committee was to investigate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether the proposed sale of ANL has been conducted with the prudence, discretion, integrity, skill and propriety necessary:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. to protect the value of ANL and its assets;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. to realise the maximum price for ANL, and its assets; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. to avoid prejudice to the interests of the Commonwealth, including the potential prejudice to the environment and the Australian shipping industry arising from the impact of increasing dependence on sub-standard and flag-of-convenience shipping.</PARA>
<PARA>There has been some very topical, interesting, appropriate and relevant evidence produced to that inquiry by the former Chairman of ANL, Mr Bill Bolitho, who was unceremoniously dumped by the Minister for Transport last year. At the committee's first hearing, on September 22&mdash;just a few days ago&mdash;he seriously called into question the actions of the government and particularly of the minister over the inept handling of the sale of ANL. This is stuff that condemns the minister. When I look at the fact that the minister's actions have resulted in a massive diminution in the value of ANL, I think the time has come when the minister ought to consider his position. Mr Bolitho, on 22 September 1995, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANL was not bankrupt in August 1994 when the minister replaced the board and made his remarkable `couldn't give it away' statements. Although certainly undercapitalised by deliberate government policy and operating in a difficult market environment, it was a going concern with net assets in excess of $100 million. It did, however, have difficulties sufficient to cause me grave concern. Those difficulties were fairly and squarely of the minister's making and were put to him as such in writing on a number of occasions without result.</PARA>
<PARA>So the minister received correspondence from the Chairman of ANL, pointing out where the minister was going wrong and pointing out the obstacles that the minister was placing in the way of the success of ANL. The minister did not even have the courtesy to reply to Mr Bolitho. The Auditor-General, as at 30 June 1994, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANL was a going concern, with positive net assets able to meet its obligations as they fell due.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was the view of ANL's commercial auditors, ANL's financial advisers, ANL's board of directors&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and the Chairman of ANL, Mr Bolitho. So when one looks at the situation prior to the minister's comments it seems that ANL was clearly worth at least $100 million, but in August 1994 the minister claimed that ANL was a basket case and said you `couldn't give it away'. So the government has been forced into a position of having to flog what is left of ANL to P&amp;O for $19.5 million. The board valued ANL at $26 million. The net assets of ANL were worth more than $100 million and we now find that what is left is being flogged off for a mere $19.5 million. So the minister clearly is responsible for a massive diminution in the value of ANL and he has cost the Australian taxpayer an enormous amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of parliament get requests from constituents for extra government spending in many areas. There is a community demand for so much government expenditure, but of course in the present economic climate the government says it cannot afford to spend the kind of money that is required in some areas. Also, we find the government is building up national debt. The incompetence of the minister has resulted in this massive reduction in the value of ANL. Tens of millions of dollars have been wiped off the value of ANL because of the minister's loose use of the English language. I believe the minister stands condemned. He really ought to look very closely at his position. I do not think the minister is a fit and proper person to hold such a position of high office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANL Bill 1995 makes provision to facilitate the sale of Commonwealth shares in Australian National Line Ltd. The bill effectively amounts to the liquidation of what is left of ANL. Among the provisions of the bill are transitional and savings arrangements with respect to employee entitlements prior to the sale. Other provisions relate to the transfer of ANL assets, liabilities, rights and obligations which P&amp;O does not wish to acquire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a company that was worth more than $100 million. What is left of it is being sold for $19.5 million. But the government and the minister have created an environment where the buyer is not prepared to take ANL in its entirety. So the buyer is saying to the government, `We will take this lemon off you, provided you give us what we want, provided you retain some assets, liabilities, rights and obligations which you can put into a new body which you are going to call RetainCo.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, the government, through its inept handling of this whole matter, has destroyed the value of ANL. P&amp;O has taken what it wants and the government is left with some of the assets and liabilities which are going to continue to cost the Australian taxpayer money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the House makes two appropriations. The first one is for the sum of $15 million for payments which may eventuate concerning assets, liabilities, rights and obligations being transferred to the company to be known as RetainCo and any residual liability relating to assets, liabilities, rights and obligations sold to P&amp;O associated with the sale transfer. The second appropriation is for an unspecified amount for the establishment of RetainCo and includes payments associated with the establishment and working capital required for RetainCo or an alternative Commonwealth entity. This blank cheque, this unspecified appropriation, is for a period of one year. As has been indicated by the honourable member for Charlton, a golden share will be retained for a certain period by the government following the sale of ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has indicated it is totally incompetent. The government, against opposition by a number of backbenchers and former ministers within its own ranks&mdash;and I see that the honourable member for Charlton is nodding enthusiastically&mdash;has decided it is going to sell ANL. I can understand. If I were a member of the government who was opposed to the sale of ANL I would feel robbed and cheated by the bill we are discussing tonight in the chamber. It would be one thing to sell ANL for $100 million. You could take the $100 million and put it against some of the massive foreign debt that the Labor government has built up over the last 13 years, the foreign debt that is putting up the interest rate payments being made by Australian home buyers and farmers. It would be one thing to sell ANL and get this money in to retire debt, but the government said it was going to sell it in 1991. It was going to sell it in 1992, in 1993, in 1994. Here we are now in 1995 and we find the minister coming in to sell ANL for a mere $19.5 million. </PARA>

I am certain the member for Charlton would appreciate the opportunity to try to negotiate with his colleagues yet again for a more reasonable outcome.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of last week, Laura Tingle wrote about it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. I do not know that she is really any great friend of the coalition. The subheading in her article was `Labor's behaviour in flogging our shipping line has been disgraceful'. It absolutely has. The minister has not been able to make a clear decision anywhere down the line. He does not have the ability to make a clear decision. He has been ducking, diving, darting and carrying on. He has been withholding evidence and information. He has not let the full story out and let the Auditor-General get a clear run in looking at the procedure that was undertaken in selling Australian National Line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the way down the line, the ACTU and the Maritime Union of Australia have been involved. To whose detriment? Who is benefiting and who is suffering the consequences of this mismanagement? It is the taxpayers of Australia. History will record that the taxpayers of Australia have been very poorly represented in this whole sorry saga and have been very poorly treated with regard to what has gone on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this government is dealing with taxpayers' money, they think it is their own. They think they have this big bank account and they can throw it around however they like. They have no comprehension of what it takes for people to earn that money, which pays the taxes that are put in the Reserve Bank for the government to fritter way in disgraceful exercises such as the sale of ANL. As all the coalition speakers on this bill this afternoon have indicated, we are certainly not opposed to privatisation. But there should be privatisation for the right reasons, not the wrong reasons. Privatisation should be done in a fully accountable and transparent way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debates that have taken place in this parliament this week have, oddly enough, all revolved around the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Industrial Relations, with the privatisation of ANL, the proposed privatisation of Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney and the privatisation of Qantas. One thing that has been highlighted in all this&mdash;the Labor Party will never get it right in this country as far as public policy is concerned&mdash;is that you absolutely cannot have a portfolio minister responsible for the commercial activities of government business enterprises. That has been proven beyond doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It came through to us in evidence the Joint Committee of Public Accounts took over the last 12 months into the commercialisation of government business enterprises in Australia. There seemed to be this element. It does not happen in other countries that have gone down the path of commercialisation and privatisation. They have a separate ministerial portfolio looking after those GBEs. There is a minister for GBEs or commercial activities with the Commonwealth shareholder in that entity. There is not a conflict of interest, as has been so evident in this whole exercise with ANL and the whole exercise, from which we are still suffering, related to the proposed privatisation of Kingsford Smith airport and air traffic control management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disgraceful way that the minister is conducting his portfolio in that area is highlighting that, as far as public policy in Australia is concerned, in the future we have to divide those two responsibilities. We cannot leave them the same any more. We have moved on from a situation where the minister's line agency within his department always looked after these agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to commercialise an activity and put it at arm's length so that its responsibility is to provide the government with a dividend, that is fine. We should not let the portfolio minister impose the political imperatives of the day on that GBE. That is what has happened in the saga of the sale of Kingsford Smith airport. That is why we are in the mess that we are in. Australia and the taxpayers of this nation own this shipping line. The Labor Party in government does not own it; the taxpayers of Australia do. We have been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into it for years. The government does not own it. That is what has caused the waste of money here. The political imperatives have got in the way of the commercial imperatives. They cannot get it clear in their head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another good reason why they cannot do that. They have never had any commercial experience. They have never run a business. They do not know how to separate these responsibilities. That has become absolutely clear in this whole sorry saga. There is no morality in what has been going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the interesting article written by Laura Tingle. Its subheading is `Labor's behaviour in flogging our shipping line has been disgraceful'. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And a small technicality of the "sale" for "$19.5 million" is that, whatever P&amp;O is buying in terms of assets, taxpayers get to keep $183 million in liabilities which the British-owned shipping line doesn't want.</PARA>
<PARA>So they are only selling the good parts. The taxpayers will still wear the liabilities. She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, facing a likely rebuff on the sale, already delayed for four years, by the ALP national conference, Brereton selectively released details of a valuation of ANL which showed it had a negative value&mdash;and which he used to justify his decision to withdraw it from sale.</PARA>
<PARA>That relates to the infamous `You couldn't give it away' quote. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Soon after this, he rammed through the sale of the shipping line's only decent asset, a 25 per cent interest in Australian Stevedores, before the unions could stop it.</PARA>
<PARA>So he sold the good bit. He is now trying to give the rest of it away and make the taxpayers wear the liabilities. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brereton was in such a hurry to do this that he agreed via mobile phone from a funeral to a deal letting the supposedly financially wrecked ANL lend the money to the buyer without any firm security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deal had another price: an ongoing $20 million a year support bill for local mariners.</PARA>
<PARA>We know what that is all about. That is a separate bill that went through the place called the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill 1995. We know what that is all about. It is just unbelievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that that money was lent without any firm security, yet the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley)&mdash;he was only the Minister for Finance at the time&mdash;stood in this place and denied it.

That is the way that this minister has been running the whole exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to an experience I had in the inquiry we were undertaking into the commercialisation of government business enterprises. We were taking evidence in a hearing from the general manager of ANL. It was when all this was going on. The general manager was sitting in a public hearing of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts giving evidence. Who was sitting behind him?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other very interesting element, and we have all made mention of it, is the proposed sale price for ANL of $19 1/2 million.

I will read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> some of the comments the former chairman had to make about the whole sorry exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that out of the sale price Mr Wran is getting 1.7 per cent. Mind you, Mr Wran is one taxpayer in Australia. He is one of 18 million people. He is getting 1.7 per cent of the sale price. Mr Turnbull is getting 1.5 per cent. Mr Spark is getting 1.4 per cent. It is unbelievable. The people of Australia still have not been told on what grounds these people were appointed to run the shipping line after the board was sacked and what expertise they have&mdash;two are solicitors or barristers or what have you; one is a former Premier of New South Wales; and two are involved in a contract cleaning business in Sydney. They have all been given the job of looking after our debt ridden Australian National Line to try to get it up and going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the time they have been involved in it, the situation has got worse and it has cost the Australian taxpayers some $816,000 to pay these consultants.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Laurie Brereton is to be remembered as anything but a political liability for the Keating Government, then he must convince tomorrow's Cabinet meeting on ANL that privatisation is the way to go.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANL has lost $53.7 million of taxpayers' funds since 1991. Business and workers lost tens of millions of dollars more when the Maritime Union of Australia closed the nation's waterfront for six days last year to try to thwart the privatisation of ANL.</PARA>
<PARA>We are yet to see what deal has been done with the Maritime Union of Australia to get them to agree to this sale. Another newspaper headline read `$900 a night directors land $816,000 ANL fee', and the article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fees for the Federal Government's consultants for the sale of ANL&mdash;principally former Labor NSW Premier Mr Neville Wran and merchant banker Malcolm Turnbull&mdash;have come to $816,000, which is almost 5 per cent of ANL's expected sale price.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely unbelievable. It would not be justified anywhere in the commercial world, and the people of Australia know it. The members of the government are running their litany of lies about all sorts of other things to try to get a bit of attention away from some of the disgraceful episodes they are overseeing whilst they are in government. An article written by Alan Ramsey headed `Toot, toot! The ship's come in' states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two weeks ago, on July 19, a senior Canberra bureaucrat went before the Remuneration Tribunal to argue the case for another month's fees for three part-time appointments to a special government project.

It was the fourth time in a year the Keating Government had gone to the tribunal asking for authority to keep shaking the money tree.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original appointments, on August 22 last year, had been for six months.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the Government was back for yet another extension, this time by a single month to round out the appointments to a full year. Hopefully it will be the last time.</PARA>

<PARA>We certainly do. As far as the management of the Australian National Line is concerned, it has been an outrageous exercise to see the amount of taxpayers' money wasted in this whole sorry saga. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to read a couple of the comments the former chairman of directors of ANL, Mr Bill Bolitho, made in a submission to the Senate inquiry. They are quite interesting. I know that the government members will pooh-pooh them; they will discredit them. They might say he is suffering from some mental disorder, but that is not the case. He must have been well regarded enough by the government to keep him there as the chairman of the board for as long as he was, obviously until he had some sort of disagreement with the minister, young Dangerman. Mr Bolitho said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in making the statements and taking the actions that he did in respect of ANL the minister was motivated not by regard for his duties and responsibilities as a minister of the crown, but by personal political and party political considerations.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the point I made earlier in my address on this bill. If this exercise has highlighted anything about public policy in Australia, it is that we must divide the responsibilities between the minister responsible for GBEs and the portfolio minister. Mr Bolitho went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for some long period of time the TFAS were working to a clandestine Government policy in respect of the sale of ANL which was not known to the board and management of ANL. ANL was thus working dutifully within guide lines provided to them by Government unaware that those guide lines were spurious and that they clashed with the Government's real objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a combination of the inappropriate TFAS structure and the dichotomy between the Government's clandestine policy in respect of ANL and its spurious public policy rendered the sale process impossible of commercially appropriate achievement and under Minister Brereton led to the virtual destruction of a valuable tax payer asset for political reasons.</PARA>
<PARA>At least Mr Bolitho recognises that the Australian National Line belongs to the taxpayers of Australia and not to the Labor Party in government. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to 22/8/94; on that day; and subsequently LB made a number of public statements to the effect that the Government was pouring money into ANL; that ANL was a basket case with negative net worth; that it could not be given away, and that it would be necessary for the Government to pay someone to take it off their hands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 9/9/94 LB sold ANL's 25% shareholding in Australian Stevedore Holdings (ASH) to Jamison Equity Limited for $28 Million. The sale was made on deferred payment terms extended by ANL as Jamison had insufficient funds at that time to effect the sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In taking these actions and in making these statements LB stated that he was relying on a "due diligence" report (the report) on ANL jointly conducted by Price Waterhouse and Salomon Brothers. The report was jointly commissioned by the Departments of Finance and Transport &amp; Communications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the exception of a heavily censored "executive summary" LB did not make this report available to either the Auditor General or the old board for review before acting upon it and it has never been made available for public scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA>That is just an incredible turn of events. There again lies some of the problems from which we in Australia are suffering. The minister would not let the Auditor-General have a look at that report or the performance of ANL because it is a GBE, because it might be commercially sensitive or, more correctly, because it might be too politically sensitive. That is where there is a conflict of interest in this whole exercise between the executive, the parliament of Australia and the taxpayers of Australia who own these assets. Mr Bolitho went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my belief that these actions and omissions on the part of LB and the Government were designed to produce a circumstances in which LB could pursue political objectives at the expense of a public asset ANL and the commercial reputations of the directors involved, free from objective public and parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seen in the light of the foregoing, the actions and statements of LB in respect of ANL are inconsistent with his responsibilities and duties as a minister for the crown.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the comments of Mr Bolitho, the former chairman of ANL. I reiterate what I said before: as far as public policy in Australia is concerned&mdash;and regardless of who wins the next election&mdash;we must address the situation which puts ministers in the compromising situation where they are faced with a conflict of interest in terms of their duties and their responsibilities in relation to the political and commercial imperatives of operating these GBEs which they operate on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia. They are ultimately the ones who own these public assets that the government is playing with and losing money on. That is what this bill is about. </PARA>

We have heard from previous speakers about the saga of events relating to the government's management and intended sale of ANL.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This vividly highlights the sheer incompetence of the present Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in overseeing this portfolio. It highlights the `don't care' imperial style of the ALP's New South Wales right wing. It also highlights the tiredness and inability of this government to govern. Their handling of the whole affair can almost be said to be an unbelievable shemozzle. It is real <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One flew over the cuckoo's nest</EMPHASIS> stuff. It illustrates without doubt the ALP's well-known inability to handle money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The genesis of ANL was in World War I when the Commonwealth government seized 28 vessels, prizes of the war. The fleet was eventually built up to 54 vessels. In 1923 it became known as the Commonwealth Government Line. It was later rechristened the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. In 1956 it became the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission. It took over the vessels of the Australian Shipping Board. In 1989 it became ANL Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1991-92 appropriation bills the government announced that it would sell 49 per cent of ANL, but when Price Waterhouse had a look at the sale they said it was an unattractive proposition and the lot should be sold if the government intended to sell anything. Of course the sale of ANL has been in the budget since, but it still has not been sold. It appears that this government not only cannot create or manage anything but also cannot sell anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the saga surrounding ANL. In 1991 the government announced that it would sell ANL. In the 1992 budget papers the government said that the proceeds of the sale were expected in late 1992-93 or in the first part of 1993-94. It was of no surprise when the 1993-94 budget came down and they said that the proceeds from the sale would be deferred until late 1993-94 or early 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March last year the due diligence report was undertaken. It was found that ANL had a negative net worth of $74.8 million to $117.8 million after all debts were cleared. In August last year the Minister for Transport abandoned the sale with his infamous comment, `You couldn't give it away.' He then sacked the ANL board and put in his cronies, Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and Mr Spark. I will come to them later. It was soon after that that the maritime unions went on strike and shut down the nation's waterfront. The minister rushed ahead and sold ANL's 25 per cent share in Australian Stevedores for $28 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The six-day strike ended soon thereafter when the government offered them a bribe of a $20 million tax exemption. Everybody else in the country has to pay tax except them. They were exempt from tax when working on the international line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then the Auditor-General has commented on the activities of ANL. It was interesting that the Auditor-General found that no written briefings were provided to ministers at any stage. The Auditor-General went on to criticise both the evaluation of ANL and, implicitly, the way it was allowed to be used. The Auditor-General also said that the loan associated with the rapid sale of Australian Stevedores was free from interest and charges and the mortgage given as security was not registered until 21 October&mdash;that is, six weeks after the deal was struck. That highlights the long list of incompetence on the minister's part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General went on to say that ANL has been costing taxpayers $53.7 million since 1991. This proposal to sell ANL was finally taken to cabinet and it was finally agreed to sell 100 per cent of ANL to P&amp;O but with certain conditions attached. That is what we are debating today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say something about the temporary board comprising Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and John Spark. They were appointed for six months in August last year and they had a brief to salvage ANL or sell it. Over the last 12 years that this government has presided over ANL it has lost in total $200 million. When they took over there were about 850 jobs in ANL, 400 of which were in head office in Melbourne, and it owned 12 ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The temporary board appeared to have achieved very little in the first six months of operation other than tapping into the public purse themselves. When the minister's office first went before the tribunal to get the money to pay them for this job they argued that it would be an extremely complex and demanding job requiring intensive personal effort and commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a letter to the tribunal the office argued that `the Minister for Transport, Laurie Brereton, believes there is a need for strong remuneration arrangements'. They were indeed special. The minister recommended that the chairman, Neville Wran, get $150,000; Malcolm Turnbull, $120,000; and Mr Spark, $120,000. The tribunal accepted this compelling argument and awarded for the first six months $151,077.50 to Neville Wran and $120,857 to the other two board members for what amounted to about two days work a week each. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of this Malcolm Turnbull got an extra $30,000 for the panic sale of Australian Stevedores. That is something which has never been totally explained. They were certainly milking the taxpayer in this regard. Some people have commented that Australian Stevedores was sold for about $14.7 million less than its true value and this made the rest of ANL harder to sell. Why we were paying these people to do these things is certainly a matter for debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the six months came and went, and they had achieved nothing. In February this year they went before the tribunal again and asked for another three-month extension. However, at the end of that period they still had not achieved what they originally set out to do. In May this year they again went before the tribunal and asked for another two-month extension. But&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;at the end of that period they still had not achieved what they set out to do, so in July this year the minister's office again went before the tribunal and asked for another month's extension for these three people to be employed. Just that month alone cost the taxpayer $66,019.40. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of this 12-month saga this famous trio still had not achieved anything. They milked the taxpayers $816,137.80 but they had achieved nothing. The government finally found that they were too embarrassed to go before the tribunal again to ask for yet another extension. The minister himself started to do what he was supposed to be doing in the first place by trying to put in place negotiations with the buyers and the unions to see what he could achieve, but he has achieved very little to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> During that 12-month period it is interesting to note that Neville Wran has taken home $301,733.40, Malcolm Turnbull, $272,202.20, and John Spark, $242,202.20. That is about five per cent of the total value of ANL at $17 1/2 million. It is doubtful that the government will get anything like that for it&mdash;if, indeed, they do sell it. On top of that, the trio took home expenses. They were being paid at almost three times the rate of senior public servants in this country. This three-man board received $300 each a night. That is $900 if they only took advantage of that for one night a week. That alone would have amounted to an extra $46,800 of taxpayers' money.

I was interested to see the following comment in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 2 September:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANL privatisation ranks as Labor's most glaring failure&mdash;if maximising the sale price was the criterion.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that sums it up very well indeed. The government has been paralysed for most of the negotiation that has taken place in its attempts to sell ANL. It has been very much beholden to the unions. The Maritime Union of Australia, the old Waterside Workers Federation, said recently that they will strike `within 20 minutes' if the sale to P&amp;O proceeds. The government is obviously terrified to act. We are going to have to wait until 31 October to find out whether this high farce comes to something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of unions are involved in the matter. They include the MUA, as I have mentioned, the Australian Services Union and the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers. I was interested to see that the Australian Maritime Officers Union, which is the union of the captains and officers of ANL, has agreed with the sale. That union wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), which we do not hear too much about, urging him to speed the sale up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at P&amp;O, which is the only company that has a bid in for ANL. It is a very reputable company with a 150-year track record in Australia. It is involved in cruising, ferries, containers, bulk shipping and European transport as well as its Australasian operations. Under Lord Sterling's leadership P&amp;O has increased its profit worldwide from $342 million to $498 million over the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year in Australasia alone, P&amp;O lifted its profit from $71 million to $92 million&mdash;and this is without any subsidies at all. The company already employs over 400 Australian officers and seamen, 1,700 stevedores and close to 18,000 Australians in other areas such as cold storage, catering, cleaning and the holiday business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this very moment P&amp;O is building the largest ship in the world&mdash;a 104,000-tonne cruise ship. The company injects a payroll of over $400 million in Australia and has assets worth over $1 billion. I would also add that, even after P&amp;O bought the New Zealand Line some time ago, it still employs the same number of people today as it employed then. The company employs more people today than when it originally bought the European ferries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, in the first round, P&amp;O offered the government $30 million for ANL. Two other companies&mdash;Sealand, a US owned company, and ANZDL, which is a French owned company&mdash;also put in bids. But the government said it was not satisfied with the structure of the bids and invited the companies to resubmit their tenders. Sealand dropped out, ANZDL also dropped out in May this year&mdash;it could not stand the way the government was handling it&mdash;and P&amp;O put in a lesser bid of $17.5 million. If the government had not fiddled around by being beholden to the unions, all this could have been wrapped up a long time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have one suggestion for the minister in all of this: perhaps he would like to sell ANL to the Maritime Union of Australia. If that union thinks that the minister is not doing the right thing with this bill, perhaps they would like to put their money where their mouth is; that is, buy it themselves and see if they can run it properly. We already have Australian crews in both the international and coastal operations refusing to carry out maintenance when the ships are operating, unlike what exists in virtually every other country in the world. Those crews could be overhauling the engines or scraping the rust off, which would mean that the ships then spend less time in dry dock than do the ships of our rivals from other countries of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of these Australian crews refusing to do this maintenance when ships are operating is about $1 million per ship per year. Why the tribunal of Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and John Spark did not recommend at least something be done about this in the interim, I do not know. At least they would then have earned the money that the taxpayers paid to them. By having proper ship maintenance, the average ship life in other shipping lines is about 25 to 30 years. However, with the Australian ships in ANL, it is closer to 15 years. Just think of the cost of that when you add it up over a period. So the government has a very sorry record of achievement in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look back over the four years since the government first suggested they might sell ANL. In that time there have been admitted losses of $118.3 million. There was at least $17 million&mdash;and some people have estimates of up to $60 million&mdash;in losses to shipping lines from the strike. There has been a $14.7 million loss, in a sense, for the devalued panic sale of Australian Stevedores, and there has been a downgrading which will probably amount to a difference of something like $20 million in the offer that P&amp;O originally made but what they will eventually end up paying. So there is $170 million down the gurgler already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has overseen all of that. On top of that he has offered $20 million each year in tax exemptions to Australian crew members. No other worker in Australia can get that. In addition, in this bill there is a $15 million contingency for possible costs associated with the sale&mdash;whatever that is supposed to mean. So already there is a loss of over $200 million in four years alone. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a small contribution to this debate on the ANL Sale Bill 1995. Before getting to the substance of what I want to say, it is very interesting, when reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Bills Digest</EMPHASIS>, to chart the history of the Australian government's participation in shipping. Back in 1916 the Australian government took over 28 vessels seized as the prizes of war and progressively from the navy, during the First World War, that was built up to a fleet of 54 vessels. It was named the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers in 1923 but, by 1928, all the vessels had been sold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After World War II&mdash;would you believe&mdash;we chartered some of these former vessels back to run Australia's shipping interests. In 1956 the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission was formed. It operated under the registered name of the Australian National Line. Then, in 1974, the operational side of the business came under the Australian Shipping Commission Act. In 1988 it became ANL. In 1989 the Australian Shipping Commission ceased&mdash;on 30 June&mdash;and on 1 July it became a wholly owned public company of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to what some speakers on the government side have said today&mdash;rather selectively&mdash;that somehow the use of these vessels was a Country Party plot just to look after its interests in north Queensland or to service inefficient routes to north Queensland and Darwin, the Australian owned shipping companies over the years have moved in and out of various commissions and acts. They have been sold, replaced, leased, changed and their forms of administration have varied from outright ownership by the Commonwealth right through to a wholly owned public company with the Commonwealth as the sole shareholder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This so-called icon has never been one continuous thread going through Australian shipping. It is something that has been changed, massaged, to suit the convenience of the day. So to come in here trying to create the myth that somehow it is an icon is quite dishonest. As a National Party member, I resent the idea that somehow this was done over the years to satisfy the Country Party. It was not. In many instances the ANL was kept going not to satisfy the Country Party but to satisfy the unions which were involved in its running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the government speakers talked emotively about this nation `girt by sea'&mdash;this maritime nation. If the government really believed that, would it have allowed ANL to get into such an appalling mess? In Queensland at present we have had five meatworks close. Those five meatworks depend very heavily on export and, in depending on export, one of their chief costs is freight. It seems to me appalling that beef can be sold in America on the hoof 60 per cent dearer than it is in Australia on the hoof. It can be processed, trucked across America&mdash;across the American wharves&mdash;brought across the Pacific and across our wharves and finally sold in the shops for 40 to 50c a kilo less than the price of Australian beef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is that we had an efficient delivery system of our own. Had the government been fair dinkum about this nation `girt by sea', and had the government been fair dinkum about wanting to enhance Australian exports, it would not have allowed itself to be held to ransom by the union. It would not have allowed the Australian National Line to become an international joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1994 the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) declared that you couldn't give the government shipping line away&mdash;you couldn't give ANL away. In the bill before us today&mdash;the ANL Sale Bill 1995&mdash;we have seen the ultimate confirmation that the minister was indeed right. We certainly can't give it away. In fact, as Laura Tingle so succinctly put it, we are going to ask someone to take it off our hands. As she said, and it should be etched on the government benches so they never forget it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . taxpayers are actually paying $100 million to have what is left of their sad little shipping line&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>note the words `sad little shipping line'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">taken off their hands.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's action, or rather its inaction, over the sale of ANL is nothing short of disgraceful. It is disgraceful for three reasons. Firstly, the government has put the interests of its union mates ahead of the interests of all Australians, ahead of the interests of this nation. Don't give us this pretty stuff of a nation `girt by sea' and allow this rort to go on a continuous basis at the hands of the unions. Secondly, for the last four years the government has used this so-called asset sale to artificially cut its budget deficit. Thirdly, the government has taken too long to come to terms with the real problem of this ailing national shipping line and has chosen to sit on its hands. Put simply, the government cannot be trusted on such issues of national importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes the bill provides a way out of the ANL troubles, but we know that the bill before us today simply provides a framework for a sale agreement to occur. There is no guarantee, even at this stage, that a sale will happen. Going by the strike actions of the Maritime Union of Australia last September, one wonders whether such an agreement will ever be possible. As the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) who spoke previously said, it is very interesting that they have threatened that they can call a strike at 20 minutes notice. That puts the government on notice. It puts the government in the position: `Guys, you step out of line just one iota and we'll crash your shipping line on the eve of an election.' That is a threat the government obviously takes very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than the government sitting down with the potential buyer&mdash;P&amp;O&mdash;and striking up a deal on behalf of Australian taxpayers, who are the ultimate owners of ANL, it seems the government is more preoccupied with satisfying the Maritime Union. The government has said that it wants a deal struck by 31 October. This bill provides for a deadline of 1 January 1996, or the bill is automatically repealed and we are back to square one. So in essence the bill before us today is simply a short-term solution. If the sale negotiations fail, so does the bill. The real focus of the ANL debate should be back on the government: how it and the minister in particular have failed to resolve this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal with the board fees because I think they go to the heart of the ethics of this business. The whole business of consultancy and government-appointed directors has become a farce during the term of this government. In the context of this whole saga we find that 22 August 1984 is a significant date. Not only was it the day when Minister Brereton made the infamous statement, `You couldn't give it away,' but it was also the day that the minister sacked the old part-time nine-member board of ANL and appointed Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and John Spark to either salvage it or sell it. As members will remember from that very emotive speech by the minister, the new board was given six months to come up with the goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister personally pleaded for special remuneration packages for these three so-called experts who just happen to be three old mates of the Labor Party. That was just a coincidence, of course. For the six-month period they were handsomely rewarded: Wran as chairman received $151,000 and Turnbull and Spark received $120,000 each. The total was $392,000 for two days' work per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as we know, the new board did not come up with a solution within six months. The board's term was subsequently extended&mdash;first to nine months, then to eleven months and then to 12 months. Each time, the government went back to the Remuneration Tribunal asking for more money; each time digging deeper and deeper into taxpayers' pockets. By the end of their 12-month stint the three directors will have cost taxpayers around $816,000 with no result on ANL. If we project forward to 31 October, the government's preferred date, we are looking at 14 months; if we project forward to 31 December, we are looking at 16 months. As previous speakers have said, it will be interesting to know if any additional fees are paid to these people for the tail end of the exercise. One could say that, like the rest of the ANL saga, the government has been content to continue to throw good money after bad, especially when it comes to so-called experts who were paid to fix the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of RetainCo is a very interesting sidelight to this issue. The bill makes provision to facilitate the sale of the Commonwealth's shares in the Australian National Line Ltd&mdash;ANL. Many would say that this bill has been a long time coming&mdash;four years in fact&mdash;since the government first announced the proposed sale of ANL. The bill provides the framework within which a sale agreement will hopefully be struck between the government and P&amp;O by 1 January 1996. As I have said, if no agreement is reached by that date we are back to square one&mdash;trying to flog off an even more devalued government asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill establishes a corporate entity&mdash;RetainCo&mdash;which will be used as a vehicle to marshall all the assets and liabilities of ANL. If the sale proceeds, RetainCo will hold and manage the residual assets of ANL: in other words, those vessels that P&amp;O does not want. That involves some five vessels. The latest sale price we have heard touted for ANL is a meagre $19.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ironically, in this bill the government has set aside some $15 million of taxpayers' money to establish RetainCo, together with further unspecified appropriations to keep RetainCo afloat after the proposed sale has been completed. What a farce&mdash;to get $19.5 million for your primary asset and then have to put $15 million aside to prop up the entity that has to look after the bits and pieces left at the end!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that under the sale agreement P&amp;O could also take some $140 million in operating debt, leaving ANL or RetainCo with a potential debt from its long-term leasing arrangements of $183 million. That may or may not be realised. As a previous government speaker has said, it could well be that that debt is liquidated; on the other hand, it might not be liquidated. If it is not, it will make this sorry saga even more embarrassing for the government and will show just how inept this whole operation has been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for the continued guarantee of debts and liabilities of RetainCo in addition to any foreseeable borrowing requirements of RetainCo. Nevertheless, I am pleased to see that the government's guarantee is in place. The government believes that the potential debt of $183 million will be paid back through income earned from subleasing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, one company that will be helping the government to pay off this potential debt is Queensland Alumina Ltd which operates from Gladstone in my electorate of Hinkler in central Queensland. QAL subleases two ANL ships&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">River Boyne</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">River Embley</EMPHASIS>. These specially built ships have been subleased from ANL for 20 years and the leases are due to expire in the year 2003. They are designed to carry 71,000 tonne loads of bauxite from Weipa to Gladstone for the refinery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the sale proceeds, QAL will be subleasing from RetainCo not ANL. In essence, the sale will have little or no effect on the leasing arrangements, and that is one thing which I am pleased to see. That aside, the government still has to recover this potential debt of $183 million. However, not all the arrangements with the ships may necessarily be as prudential as is the case with QAL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably no coincidence that we are debating this bill today. I am certain that the minister is anxious to complete the debate in the House, given the fact that the Senate inquiry into the ANL sale debacle began last Friday. In evidence to the inquiry Mr Bolitho said that ANL was not bankrupt in August 1994 when the minister replaced the board and made the remarkable statement, `You couldn't give it away.' Mr Bolitho said that ANL was certainly undercapitalised by deliberate government policy in operating in a difficult market environment; it was a going concern with net assets in excess of $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at the whole scenario and sheet the blame back to where it deservedly belongs. The puppet master in this whole exercise has been Minister Brereton. He is the person who rammed home the only decent sale of ANL assets&mdash;the share in Australian Stevedores. He is the person who set up the deal allowing the financially strapped ANL to lend money, would you believe, to the buyer; to say nothing of the $20 million support for local mariners. He is the man who sacked the nine-man board of ANL. He appointed the Wran-Turnbull-Spark triumvirate. He was the person who said, `You couldn't give it away.'

The south-eastern growth corridor is made up of the city of Casey and the shire of Cardinia. Within those metropolitan areas are the villages of Berwick, Cranbourne and Pakenham.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With sadness, I draw to the attention of the House the horror of the continuing tragic ethnic war in Sri Lanka. According to Medecins Sans Frontieres, the French based agency which is providing medical assistance to the war victims in Sri Lanka, the latest incident that took place on 22 September 1995 at a school located in the north-eastern coastal town of Nagar Kovil, in the Jaffna Peninsula, saw artillery shelling by the Sri Lankan security forces leaving 100 hundred civilians dead, including at least 34 children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MSF, for which the Australian government also provided funds recently to support its good work in the war-ravaged areas, has further revealed that 22 amputations were performed at the town's hospital by local and MSF doctors. The irony is that this incident took place within hours of the Sri Lankan government imposing censorship on reporting news of its operations in the Tamil homeland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only in July this year there was another massacre of civilians in the Jaffna Peninsula as a result of the aerial bombardment of the St Peter and St Paul Catholic Church where, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, over 100 civilians, including 13 babies, perished on the church premises. Those massacres are a clear contravention of the Geneva convention relating to international armed conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our government, which is deeply committed to upholding human rights, should publicly condemn such crimes committed against humanity and should be alarmed at the Sri Lankan government's determination to carry out such actions with impunity. Our government should endeavour to persuade both parties in the conflict to end the fighting, to accept international medication and to find a lasting political settlement to the longstanding legitimate demands of the Tamil people of Sri Lanka. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a case of a member standing up and making  propaganda of the Tamil cause. This situation has been verified by the International Committee of the Red Cross. I have heard all the excuses from supporters of the Sri Lankan government about how the Tamils broke the cease-fire which was in place earlier this year. Time will not permit me to go into the reasons as to why that cease-fire was broken. Suffice it to say that at this particular time we are talking about the massacre of innocent women and children. The incident should be condemned. Both parties&mdash;and, surely, our country could play a part&mdash;should sit once more around the table to see whether this uncalled-for massacre of innocent women and children can be stopped. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a nice touch it was to see the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou)&mdash;the electoral home of Jeff Kennett's egalitarian corporate mates&mdash;leading the coalition's outpouring of concern for ordinary workers. Of course, north of the Yarra we really appreciate those Toorak socialites and charity queens who so graciously convene fundraising nights for the poor. But, as the tax experts in this House know, a charity night is much easier on the pocket than a progressive tax regime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, one cannot help but think there is a touch of hypocrisy about this alleged concern for ordinary battlers. On 6 December 1994, during a debate on a matter of public importance, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) was howling like a dog at a bone about the power of the unions in telling us that Bill Kelty controlled the government and that trade unionists merely organised a wages claim when they wanted to improve their financial position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that if the member for Higgins truly believed that battlers were doing it hard he would be supporting their wage claims rather than deriding them or their union. Just to complicate things, members of the coalition are now arguing that under Bill Kelty and Martin Ferguson the wages of trade unionists have declined. So what is the real story? Are trade unionists running the country and dishing out huge wage increases to battlers or are battlers&mdash;as I thought the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was claiming&mdash;suffering under a Labor government? The answer is pretty simple, and no amount of rubbery statistics from the government frontbench can camouflage the reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is the coalition does not have one single policy designed to improve the lot of ordinary working people. In the north and north-west of Melbourne unemployment is in excess of 13 per cent. Amongst teenagers it is as high as 65 per cent. This, despite the fact that electorates in the north and north west are or have been represented by a Prime Minister, a deputy prime minister, the Treasurer (Mr Willis), the President of the ALP, an industry minister, and a number of parliamentary secretaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent policy announcements confirm that the government believes all it has to do is retrain the long-term unemployed and the problem of unemployment will disappear. Only this month the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) announced a $2 million program for youth unemployment. Apart from the fact that the press release announcing the $2 million expenditure is full of meaningless marketing cliches such as `the program is about informing people and developing effective local strategies for responding to young people's ideas', which means absolutely nothing and says nothing about real jobs, it pales into insignificance in the context of the government's decision in the 1995 budget to cut $1.2 billion from labour market programs. So much for labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to wonder about the government's real commitment to the unemployed. On 31 August 1995, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training accused the coalition of advocating work for the dole, yet conveniently ignored the fact that two years earlier the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) in this House said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Organisations such as meals-on-wheels would be one pathway back into employment particularly for the long-term unemployed . . . Meals-on-wheels would allow the unemployed to participate and give something back to the community in which they live.</PARA>
<PARA>Asking the long-term unemployed to work off the dole in meals-on-wheels is identical to the kind of tory authoritarianism the member for Lilley accuses the coalition of advocating. The reason work for the dole is proposed in one fashion or another by members of both sides of the House is that free market policies are not working. And, as professor Bob Gregory has pointed out ad nauseam, the loss of employment in low income neighbourhoods is the major reason for the growing discrepancy between low and top income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Flowers and tears at a women's conference in Beijing are cold comfort for the unemployed women of Coburg and Brunswick who once worked in the textile industry and are now victims of these free market policies. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) acknowledged in an interview on Wednesday 19 April:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This country, along with the great bulk of developed countries, has experienced an increase in disparities in market incomes.</PARA>
<PARA>Although he goes on to argue that broadening the social welfare net has significantly offset these disparities, he would be aware that people in the north and north-west of Melbourne want jobs and the independence that jobs provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Newspaper advertisements designed by John Singleton or one of the mates depicting the horrors of coalition wages policy are no substitute for policies directed at the most profound source of inequality&mdash;unemployment. The government must find the money, whether from taxation or the compulsorily acquired superannuation funds, to invest in those regions which are experiencing unnecessarily high unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are any number of projects&mdash;Sydney Road Shop Top development, a conservatorium of community music, the upgrading of the Upfield railway line, a rapid rail link to Melbourne airport, redevelopment of the old Pentridge prison site and the current Essendon airport site, and the refurbishment of some key sporting facilities including facilities for women's sport which would enhance the northern suburbs of Melbourne.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently, my attention was drawn to a book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Galbally for the Defence</EMPHASIS> written by Mr Frank Galbally, a barrister and solicitor from the state of Victoria. In particular, my attention was drawn to a chapter entitled `The Great NCA Disaster', which relates to the prosecution of Albert Grassby and Guiseppe Sergi on a charge of conspiring to pervert the course of justice in publishing defamatory material and Jennifer Sergi for publishing defamatory matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At best, the chapter can be said to be a chapter of fact, fiction and just plain misrepresentation. For example, on page 121 it refers to the late `Donald McKay'. The spelling of the name Mackay is wrong. On page 122 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1979 the New South Wales government set up a royal commission, headed by Mr Justice Woodward, to inquire into the disappearance and possible murder of Donald McKay&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Wrong. In 1977 a royal commission was established but not to inquire into the disappearance and murder of Donald Mackay&mdash;and everyone knows what the Woodward royal commission was about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is then alleged on page 122 that Mr Justice Woodward asserted that Mr Sergi was a principal drug trafficker and was one of the ringleaders responsible for the murder of Donald Mackay. That is false; it was not at all asserted by Mr Justice Woodward. It goes on later to talk about the person who was charged and convicted of Mackay's murder, `James Bazeley'. The spelling is totally wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 124 there is a reference to Mr Grassby as the director of the Human Relations Commission. That is wrong. Mr Grassby was never the director of the Human Relations Commission. He was, in fact, a commissioner of community relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It then goes on to talk about Michael Maher a `Liberal' member of the New South Wales parliament. All of us who know Michael Maher know full well that he has never been a member of the Liberal Party and was, in fact, a member of this House and is a member of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the same page it refers to Chris Sumner as the Attorney-General of South Australia. In 1980, Chris Sumner was the leader of the Legislative Council in South Australia. He did not become the Attorney-General of South Australia until 1982. Also on page 124, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and that secretly within the walls of the NCA (National Crime Authority) a dastardly plot was being hatched&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>This was in 1980. It may surprise Mr Galbally to learn that the National Crime Authority was not established until 1984. It really is a pretty gross misrepresentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we get on to a whole lot of factual matter. We go to page 126, where again we have a reference to this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in July 1980 Al Grassby showed the letter to Liberal MP Michael Maher&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is a second reference to a person who has never been a member of the Liberal Party. Then we go to page 127 where there is a quote from a witness who allegedly gave evidence in the prosecution. The book states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`I am satisfied that this document was not written by the person who wrote the letters to the press,' Dr Laing told the court.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Laing never gave evidence in that case and was not a witness. I would have thought that alone was enough to cause anyone grave concern&mdash;that a person like Mr Galbally would print and publish a book saying that people gave evidence in a court case when, in fact, they did not. There is another part there which is quite gross and wrong&mdash;for example, on page 134 it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NCA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>according to the magistrate, Mr Williams&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . had passed from zeal into zealotry.</PARA>
<PARA>That was not said at all by the magistrate. If I go to the transcript of the judgment, on page 21, in fact the magistrate said the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Zeal in a good cause is a commendable and indeed praiseworthy thing. I've got no doubt that the National Crime Authority is composed of many zealous men and women. I am concerned though that zealousness when taken to extremes becomes zealotry, the very antithesis of what the person was seeking to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA>He did not accuse the National Crime Authority of passing from zeal to zealotry in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are so many other examples in this particular chapter that it worries me that the public are now reading a book by a prominent criminal barrister which is full of distortions and untruths.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My reasons for doing this are that he was accused of an acquaintance with Terry Lewis, the disgraced former commissioner of police in Queensland.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that he was accused of was providing false information in a defamation case&mdash;information so petty as to be unbelievable and extraordinary that it could even be considered in such a case. But, in any event, what we had here was the word of Justice Vasta and his wife against two fairly trendy journalists who were in the car and who obviously wanted to denigrate the man.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who know Angelo Vasta and his wife&mdash;and I must say that I do not know Angelo Vasta; in fact I have never spoken to him in my life&mdash;tell me he was not that sort of person.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue was a very serious one&mdash;that he had been involved in a series of sham tax transactions. The appeals tribunal heard this case and overturned it. It was decided that his brother-in-law, Mr Coco, was entirely innocent of the charges that were made against him. In any event, Justice Vasta was once removed in that he simply had shares in the company involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened here is that the international jurists have decided that a great injustice has been done and needs to be turned around.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a strong supporter of the ABC as an important national institution in Australia and I believe that the ABC has a responsibility as a national broadcaster to do two things: firstly, to meet its national responsibilities, and, secondly, to pay great heed to local and regional sensitivities so that it maximises both its national product and the regional and local product. It is in that context that I speak tonight on the ABC board decision today to make changes to ABC news and current affairs arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1994 a proposal was put to the board to change ABC news and current affairs to have the effect that local news, produced in each state, would be at 6.30 every evening&mdash;6.30 p.m. being the traditional ABC ratings graveyard&mdash;that the national news, nationally produced, would be at 7 o'clock, and that there would be a national <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> at 7.30 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions released today by the ABC board are better than those floated to the board in August of 1994, but in some very important respects are bad, in my view. The decisions made by the ABC board today are worthy of reading into the record. Firstly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a new 7.30 Report. From Monday December 4 there will be a single program reporting on international, national and state issues. The 7 state programs will continue until Friday December 1.</PARA>
<PARA>That effectively axes the state-produced <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Reports</EMPHASIS>, and in Western Australia axes the local Perth-produced <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. Secondly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 7 pm news will continue to be produced in all states and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a substantial improvement on the proposal floated to the board in 1994. Thirdly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">News will begin introducing news on the hour from midday until 6 pm as soon as possible in 1996. State newsrooms will be encouraged to break into afternoon scheduling where major stories of state or national interest demand coverage.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a positive development. Fourthly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in 1996 and 1997, ABC news will move towards a 24 hour operation with newsbreaks throughout the day and expanded services at key times. This will include a late evening national news.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I think this is a positive development. Fifthly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a new program called "Australian Correspondent" . . . modelled on . . . "Foreign Correspondent". The program will report on the people and issues of regional Australia . . . The program is weekly and is intended to go to air in . . . March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a positive development as well and I understand that, to complement this program, three new regional offices will be established outside the capital cities, which will make a total of eight regional television bureaus, and that regional correspondents will be appointed in each capital city. I understand that in Perth a regional correspondent will be appointed to cover the south-west of Western Australia and that one of the new regional offices will be in Broome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also proposed that there be a new weekly state program, to be called `State Lateline', which I assume will become `Stateline', to be broadcast at 10.30 p.m. on Friday nights. It is expected that the compere or interviewer is likely to be the state reporter for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. The program is scheduled to go to air in February 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the analysis of these changes? It is that local news stays but state and local current affairs dies. For outlying states, particularly states like Western Australia, this is, in my view, a major blow to the quality and diversity of news and current affairs commentary, and that applies particularly in a one-newspaper state like Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC board must think that we are complete mugs if it believes the proposed state Lateline, to be shown at 10.30 p.m. on Friday, is any respectable lip-service to state-based current affairs. It is not even a respectable sop. Let us be quite frank about that. No-one is going to watch a 10.30 Lateline show on a Friday night. The ABC might as well not bother. If the ABC board is serious about state Lateline, it should find a different timeslot for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that when these changes are introduced there be an effective monitoring regime in place to ensure that the nationally produced news and the nationally produced <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> cover stories from regional Australia, from the outlying states, and that there is a sufficient catering for news for states such as Western Australia. I urge the ABC board not to believe that those of us who watch these things are complete mugs and not to think that a 10.30 show on a Friday night will be watched by anyone. If it is serious about this, it should give it a decent slot. Otherwise, frankly, it should not bother. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe we did a good job. What we are doing here now is checking those changes again. Members would appreciate that in the original report the committee recommended a couple of things. One was that the Westpac letters should go off to the National Crime Authority. That was done, but it refused to look at them. The second was to recommend a type of mediation process that could be proceeded through without the excessive costs that are normally involved in litigating these cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that in this respect the banks have failed completely to mediate appropriately. They are taking advantage by using their funds to litigate matters, which eventually drives customers into bankruptcy because they just cannot match them. I just heard this morning that Westpac has made a claim that it spends $120 million in legal expenses&mdash;I am not sure over what period that is. When you consider the tax effect of that, one-third of it at least is being picked up by the taxpayers of the country. They can prosecute propositions in cases where a client eventually falls out of the litigation process because the client cannot fund it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recommendations that comes through in this report is very important, I believe&mdash;that is, recommendation 4.16:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Treasurer provide the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration with terms of reference for an inquiry into the effectiveness of alternative dispute resolution in the banking industry, including the role played by the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA>We are aware of the Westpac letters, called the French letters. I believe that they were an indictment against one bank in this country that was never appropriately followed through. The Westpac letters were tabled before the original committee by the then general manager, Mr Stewart Fowler. I can remember the occasion well. What brought this about, as far as the overseas borrowings are concerned, was evidence that, because of the record interest rates being paid in the mid-1980s, people were wanting to go offshore to pay the lesser interest rates. Those borrowings are still having an effect on our overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that recommendation 4.16 is absolutely critical. As I said, it endeavours to follow through recommendations of earlier reports that have not yet really come to grips with mediation. I am going to talk at this time about one particular bank, Westpac. Westpac, I believe, has done all it can to avoid its moral responsibilities for the bank's fiascos since deregulation. An alternative dispute resolution mechanism has not been properly put into place and the mechanism under the present system is just not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems, of course, are not just for foreign currency borrowings. Complaints against major banks are being given to me on a regular basis. It is also a fact that, while these banks are operating within their legal responsibility, they are also entering into possession on security prior to giving customers sufficient warning that they are going to do so. We have had matters referred to our committee which, although the committee did not resolve them, were handed on and resolved. I believe that the banks are not treating those people properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been the experience, I understand, in South Australia, where one bank said it was borrowing offshore; eventually, the litigant was able to demonstrate that the bank had never gone offshore at all and there was a settlement at the court gates for a forgiven debt. We are still getting complaints on these matters from farmers and small business people and, in its own way, the committee has raised the prospect of removing the tax deductibility for litigation expenses in the hands of the bankers because they are the ones who get the full benefit; the customer is not able to get the benefit under the tax act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give a particular example which is important because it is typical of many cases with different banks across Australia at the moment. In 1985 Colin John Donkin and Heather Kay Donkin, conducting a business as hoteliers, were approached by AGC Advances Ltd to borrow money in the form of an offshore loan. On 28 April 1986 the documents were executed and the borrowings of $1.5 million offshore and $0.5 million onshore were concluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AGC Advances Ltd claimed that the Donkins defaulted under the provisions of the offshore loan securities. Proceedings commenced by the Donkins in the Federal Court of Australia in respect of the offshore loan, claiming damages for negligence. The trial judge found that AGC was in breach of its duty to advise the Donkins of the steps available to a borrower but also concluded on the evidence that no damages were sustained by the Donkins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An appeal to the High Court against the no-damage decision was withdrawn on the basis that AGC-Westpac was prepared to enter the mediation process with a view to providing the Donkins with a fair and equitable settlement to their claim. Despite protracted wavering by AGC-Westpac, a mediation was eventually attempted before Sir Laurence Street, with the mediation proving unsuccessful. It had been obvious that there had been no genuine intention by AGC-Westpac to mediate the issue and that it had been a tactic of the bank to delay justice long enough to have the appeal withdrawn so that it might just win out eventually by procrastination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Donkins continued to seriously question and could not accept the method of assessment of damages by the trial judge, Mr Justice Beaumont. Experts on foreign currency borrowings advised the Donkins that the method of calculation of damages by the trial judge, Mr Justice Beaumont, was incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Donkin eventually approached Professor Jeffrey Carmichael of the Bond University and obtained a report from him. That report indicated that there had been serious miscalculation of damages by the trial judge, who had followed the calculations provided by KPMG Peat Marwick, chartered accountants, they say, at the instructions of Mr Stuart Fowler, Chief General Manager of Westpac. Peat Marwick's was not an independent calculation but was severely compromised and prejudiced by the Westpac action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Westpac, through AGC Advances Ltd, was originally found to have been negligent in that it failed to advise the Donkins of ways to minimise the risk inherent in foreign currency borrowings. As has been the case in each subsequent court action, Westpac, through its subsidiary, has never challenged the findings of negligence. In other words, negligence has been proved; it was a matter of quantifying the amount of damages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was during the term of management of Westpac by Mr Stuart Fowler that the infamous Westpac letters of November 1987 were written by Westpac's solicitors, Allen Allen and Hemsley. Collectively, they became known as the `French letters'. These letters were tabled by Mr Stuart Fowler as chief general manager at the time of the inquiry before the House of Representatives parliamentary committee on banking, finance and public administration. I can remember that occasion very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the original recommendations by that committee in its report was for the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to refer these letters to the National Crime Authority. The National Crime Authority did not proceed with that referral, and I still believe that some government intervention could have taken place on those letters to indict the Westpac management of that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major flaw in the original calculation by KPMG Peat Marwick was to assume that an offshore loan, with a 10 per cent stop loss in place, would be effectively brought onshore when an adverse currency fluctuation exceeded 10 per cent. However, this ignored the fact that it was impossible to bring this offshore loan onshore between interest periods. Internationally respected financial experts, such as Professor Carmichael of Bond University, Professor Valentine and Dr Hunt of Sydney University of Technology, have said that it is wrong to assume that an offshore loan is automatically brought onshore when an adverse currency fluctuation occurs. Some of that has been sworn on oath. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence of KPMG Peat Marwick relied on by Justice Beaumont assumed the opposite and thus affected any financial calculation. Westpac-AGC Advances would have known that the finance facility deed of AGC Advances Ltd specifically prohibited a loan coming onshore between rollovers, yet this has not even been mentioned in the Peat Marwick report. Calculations quite the reverse of those were made on the premise that when a stop loss cover was triggered, the loan would have been brought onshore immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of the committee's original recommendation No. 60 for mediation, it is evident that this process has not been pursued by Westpac and some other banks with the good intentions that the committee intended. That is the reason that I fully support the committee's recommendation No. 4.16. It appears to me the only way in which the committee can ensure justice for all at minimum cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In connection with the Donkin case, I know that AGC-Westpac intervened by taking up their security on a vessel, which was later proved in court to have been the incorrect manner of taking possession. Yet all the constitutional rights which a citizen of Australia would expect have been denied these people in this case because, I understand, Westpac has outlaid $1 million in litigation expenses, for which they have had a tax recovery, and the Donkins themselves have paid out $300,000. One of the partners has now been bankrupted and the bank, without any mercy whatsoever, is pursuing the bankruptcy of the other partner when, they assume, the whole thing will just fall over and collapse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this is a matter where no justice has been done and that if a full mediation process had been put into place, where people genuinely came to that mediation before Sir Laurence Street, for whom I have a lot of respect, some answer could have been given. But it is obvious that the bank will do anything to fight to prevent a successful application by the litigant, because if that does occur a whole lot of other cases are just waiting to be stacked up to follow the precedent that would be set. I also want to say that in the course of a lot of the court processes, one witness of the banks was said to have been unreliable and not truthful, and in another case I understand that the judge declined to take the evidence of Stuart Fowler as being truthful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing in this debate with the Reserve Bank of Australia's position and I really believe that we should get some justice through the Reserve Bank. The Commonwealth government and the Reserve Bank give banks the licence to operate. In situations such as this, where we find that the banks are abusing their power and abrogating the trust that should exist between bank and customer, then perhaps their licences should be reviewed and if, on an annual examination, a bank is not playing its part as a proper moral corporate citizen of Australia, its licence should be revoked. I do not believe a licence should be allowed to be open-ended and it should not be used as a power to prosecute ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have  details of another case where, through the mediation process, a judgment was given by Sir Laurence Street in favour of the litigant, but the bank instructed Sir Laurence that he could not assess the claim for damages. I understand that is now rocking backwards and forwards between the bank and the litigant, the litigant is getting poorer and poorer and poorer, and the bank is just continuing it on in an effort, perhaps, to make it fold over. I have given the example of Westpac and I understand there are other banks&mdash;</PARA>

At last, I am hopeful, if the Treasurer (Mr Willis) allows us to operate on this particular recommendation, that we can go from there. Another recommendation I want to quickly deal with is the bankers' submission on the alternatives of the retirement savings accounts. I do believe that superannuation in Australia is grossly over-claimed to be savings but it does strike at the heart of investment money for Australia. I ask that the Treasurer look very closely at the bankers' proposition as an alternative to retirement savings accounts.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed a great pleasure to follow the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). When the honourable member for Dawson reflects on his time in this place he should be well satisfied with the contribution that he has made to this particular committee, consistently, over a long period of time. In fact, I find myself in agreement with the honourable member for Dawson in a number of areas and perhaps I ought to get that off my chest in the first instance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that, in setting the competition rules for banks, we have successfully managed that. The honourable member for Dawson refers to the fact that the government has given the banks a licence. I have said in the past that it is really a licence to print money. There is nothing to stop or prevent the government ensuring that these licences are for a fixed period, renewable at a public hearing. I know the argument run against me: `Oh, well, you could never take a licence away from a bank.' My response to that would be that no board of directors would allow the management of a bank to place the bank in that position. What it provides is a public forum where these actions would be accountable and could be publicly aired. The honourable member has ventilated a number of cases. There is a whole range of cases that we could all ventilate which show the banks in an appalling light, where they have used their economic power and muscle to overwhelm their customers and&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The other point I would like to raise is that of the Reserve Bank. I think the Reserve Bank does an excellent job. Its main responsibility is the fiduciary responsibility of the banks and seeing that, by and large, savers' accounts are being properly managed. I think the bank does an excellent job and it has responded over time. We have not in this country witnessed the collapse of a bank which has led to savers losing their deposits and I think we should be thankful for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area that the bank is most uncomfortable dealing with is that of the banks' responsibilities to their customers. If we want to be fair, I do not know that the Reserve Bank is ever going to feel comfortable in that area. It seems to me that, in other areas where we have set up deregulation or wanted to make sure that the benefits of competition flow right through important sectors in the economy&mdash;for example, in telecommunications, we have had a regulator with that responsibility&mdash;the setting up of an industry ombudsman has not been a bad move. I can say that, within the party, I was always opposed to that. I always wanted a public ombudsman&mdash;funded by the banks, but an independent office-holder, just as the Commonwealth Ombudsman is. However, there are areas that the ombudsman cannot cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we need a regulatory authority for the banks and a system of licences that are renewable through a public hearing process. That would cut through all the bank rhetoric that has been saying, `Aren't people being awful, they're just bank bashing,' so that banks can focus on their customers and their needs. Although that is not a majority position within the government, I very much support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have talked about how banks have dealt with their customers and foreclosed on them. I always enjoy reading Peter Roberts in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. He writes about industry and yesterday wrote about a classic example of how Australia has missed the boat. An Australian who has developed plastic wheels for bicycles as a competitive product to steel framed and other types of bicycle wheels went around Australian institutions and banks and what did he get for his product? Absolutely zero. What is happening with this? Production is starting&mdash;it is $500,000 a year&mdash;in the Philippines. This is something that could have got us back into the cycle industry in Australia and could have been a good source of exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the brains and the nous, we have developed the product and we can sell the product, but we cannot get financial backing in this country. It seems to me that institutions like banks have a lot to answer for. It comes back to the fact that banks are much more secure lending for things like housing and property development. They make little effort to provide expertise for their staff to enable them to properly assess proposals. That is a failure of the banking system. After all, it is one of their most important roles. If Australia is to maximise its opportunities for industry, value added production and exports, the banks will have to play a key role. I do not think they are pulling their weight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report tackles an issue that I was pleased to tackle with the Governor of the Reserve Bank, that is, the way in which the Australian banking system is helping our exports into Asia. With the exception of the ANZ Bank, the performance of Australian banks has been abysmal. In his response, the Governor of the Reserve Bank did not use such heavy-handed language, but he was disappointed. It is an area where, if the government of the day, no matter what its flavour&mdash;and there is bipartisan support for this&mdash;says, `A significant part of our future rests with Asia. We've got to do things culturally, diplomatically, politically and certainly from a trade perspective,' we cannot have the Australian banks sitting back and not playing their part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, it is true, Australian banks have developed relations with banks in other countries, but I am talking about a presence in those countries and being able to directly assist exporters and facilitate both-way trade. Banks have failed in that and that has been picked up in the report. Recommendation 4.16 is that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasurer provide the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration with terms of reference for an inquiry into the effectiveness of alternative dispute resolution in the banking industry, including the role played by the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA>I fully support that resolution but I want to make the point that in New South Wales, through state legislation, the banks are being forced into ADR concerning farm debt. That legislation has been sunsetted but there is a commitment from the minister for agriculture and fisheries, who introduced the bill as a shadow minister, to ensure that it will continue, and it has worked. Notwithstanding the rhetoric by the banks suggesting that it is onerous on the farmer, it is actually working. Privately they will tell you they would like to see it continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When important organisations in the economy, powerful organisations, do not do the right thing by the customers then it is a responsibility of parliaments, whether they be state or federal, to take action. I congratulate the New South Wales parliament for the action it has taken. I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Mr Richard Amery, for committing the government to extending that legislation. It is a disappointment to me that we in the national parliament have not done anything. However, with this reference I believe we will be able to have a good look at the farm sector, which is of particular concern, and also at other sectors of the economy and the way in which alternate dispute resolution can be used. I think that is good news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the recommendation on superannuation, recommendation 4.29, if there is one thing that the banks are desperate for it is to get into superannuation. Just to rattle off the figures, there is something like $500 billion in superannuation savings and it is going to grow quite considerably. My view is that the banks should have a piece of this action because the primary function of banks is to husband the nation's savings and put them to productive use. But I have to express a personal view and say that they really have to lift their game before a government of either persuasion will agree to it. Their track record is going to have to improve considerably before we let them in. I believe that they have a role to play here but their performance to date has been so appalling that they will need to lift their game. As a government member I would oppose any extension of their role at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Housing is another matter that I want to comment on. Housing attracts a very favourable capital adequacy ratio from the banks. That is, it is 50 per cent for housing compared with about 100 per cent for business loans. Therefore, the more a bank can get into housing and the less into business, the better their capital adequacy ratio is. I am not sure that that is a good thing except that it does reflect an area of risk management. The housing market has been somewhat distorted by the fact that banks are now saying that people can top up their housing loans with loans for cars and holidays and all sorts of things which otherwise would involve personal loans at a higher rate. You have only got to see the advertisements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My real area of concern is the fact that, to attract that 50 per cent capital adequacy, a depositor for a new home has to have 20 per cent of the deposit. Relating that to my electorate, my electorate has the highest density level of public housing in the country plus a fair share of what I would call `first home' private ownership. That is, those houses are the first homes that people buy after they have moved out of rented premises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be the first to confess that my wife and I did not have a 20 per cent deposit when we bought our first home. We had something like five per cent. In fact, I confess that I could not even get a loan from a bank; I had to go to a building society, for which I am eternally grateful. </PARA>

<PARA>Before speaking to the Aboriginal Land Grant and Management (Jervis Bay Territory) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, I acknowledge the presence of members of the Wreck Bay community in the gallery today. I share a very brief reflection that this proposal is one that we have seen through together since it was a glimmer in our eye or, perhaps, a dream. The bill is coming to fruition with a very large measure of cross-party support, which I welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill reflects the continuing commitment of this government to securing legitimate title to traditional lands on behalf of the Aboriginal people throughout Australia. The bill is a result of a wide acknowledgment of the significance of Jervis Bay to the local Aboriginal people and their strong work as a community in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is modelled on the very successful and highly acclaimed Uluru National Park joint management arrangement. This arrangement recently won a prestigious award, the UNESCO Picasso Gold Medal, in recognition of the outstanding management and conservation of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park which has been achieved with the participation and support of the traditional Aboriginal owners of the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, once approved by parliament, has the potential to provide opportunities for non-indigenous Australians visiting the internationally renowned Jervis Bay to learn a great deal about the vibrant indigenous culture that has cared for these lands and waters for so many generations and will undoubtedly advance Australia's international standing through its demonstration of the government's commitment to indigenous joint management of such heritage areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also represents a significant step in the reconciliation process by formalising the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community's willingness to participate in an arrangement to utilise their lands and waters in the national park as a significant and properly planned cultural tourism destination. The bill embraces the progressive views of major environmental organisations in Australia that have responded to the concept of indigenous land management in such a positive way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it should also be pointed out that the grant of these areas and associated joint management proposals have received wide public support, particularly from the local region, as is evidenced by an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS> when the government first announced its intentions in October last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will enable title to such areas of the Jervis Bay National Park and the Jervis Bay Botanic Gardens that are of significance to the Aboriginals who are members of the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community to be granted to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council, where it is deemed appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is a step in the implementation by the Commonwealth of recommendation 315 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which provides a comprehensive agenda for governments to address Aboriginal aspirations for involvement in national parks including the negotiation of lease-back arrangements which enable title to land on which national parks are situated to be transferred to Aboriginal owners, subject to the lease of the area to the relevant state or Commonwealth authority on payment of rent to the Aboriginal owners. The recommendation was endorsed by Commonwealth, state and territory governments in their response to the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is based on the models successfully applied to the Uluru and Kakadu national parks in the Northern Territory. Under the bill, the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council will lease any land granted as a consequence of the amendments back to the director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to advise the House that, as a demonstration of the determination of this Aboriginal community to gain bipartisan and other party support for this important initiative recognising Aboriginal self-determination, supplementary amendments to the bill were moved by the Leader of the Australian Democrats in the other house during the second reading debate. These supplementary amendments are now supported by the government and, I believe, non-government parties. These amendments acknowledge the sensitive environments in Jervis Bay and provide a sound legislative basis for the sympathetic management of existing Aboriginal land similar to the Commonwealth's Jervis Bay National Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amended bill increases the functions of the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council to enable the council, in consultation with the minister, to, where practicable, take action for the benefit of the community in relation to the housing, social welfare, education, training or health needs of the members of the community, and to provide community services. The amended bill provides the community with functions to protect and conserve natural and cultural sites, to engage in land use planning, to manage and maintain Aboriginal land and to conduct business enterprises for the economic or social benefit of the community. This will allow the community to enter negotiations with Commonwealth, state and other persons in the area about protection, conservation and planning issues relevant to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amended bill will also give the council power to make by-laws and provides for a procedure for the making of those by-laws.

Through the by-laws, the council will be able to control hunting, shooting and fishing on Aboriginal land. They will also be able to control visitors and charge fees, to be paid to the council. The by-laws may provide for the regulation and control of motor traffic and parking on Aboriginal land, in addition to the appointment of persons to enforce the by-laws.

In addition, to achieve consistency in the legislative regime in this sensitive environment, the by-laws may also apply regulations under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 to Aboriginal land. This will have the effect of ensuring that existing legislative protection available for the national park will also apply to the Aboriginal land that is surrounded by the park and supports the village of Wreck Bay.

The government recognises that there is a need to make the current quorum requirement at general meetings more in keeping with the expanding membership of the council. The amended bill will provide for situations where a quorum is not attained at an annual general meeting of the council. In that situation, the meeting will stand adjourned for a week and, at the adjourned meeting, the quorum is to be 40 per cent of registered members. </PARA>

The amendments to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 extend the application of that act to all Australia's territories. This would allow the Commonwealth Grants Commission to report on appropriate funding for works and services in Jervis Bay&mdash;something, I know, that the community regards as very important&mdash;as well as allowing inquiries into the financial relationships between the Commonwealth and Norfolk Island, as recently recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Delivering the goods</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to begin by welcoming the members of the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community who are with us today in the Main Committee room. How very nice to see you here, after all the very hard work you have put into getting this legislation here. Were all lobby groups as committed and as effective as this council has been, politics would be a lot smoother than it is in other areas. I thank them for keeping us up to date on all the changes they wanted to this legislation, and in keeping us fully briefed on the reasons they wanted those changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community's commitment and dedication to regaining their traditional land and creating a solid future for its members is commendable. The coalition supports the Aboriginal Land Grant and Management (Jervis Bay Territory) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, which passes title of the Jervis Bay National Park and Jervis Bay Botanic Gardens to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council on behalf of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for an agreement between the council and the National Parks and Wildlife Service that the land will be leased back to the latter body, in order that the area may continue as a national park. However the coalition is pleased that the Wreck Bay council will participate in the management of the parks and the gardens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is satisfied that, through wide consultation with the Wreck Bay council and other relevant parties, the bill ensures the existing legal rights of land-holders in the Jervis Bay Territory and the public's right to use and enjoy the national park. These rights are preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The safeguards include making the park subject to a plan of management which must be approved by parliament. Public access to the park will be guaranteed through that plan of management and commercial enterprises will be subject to it. If the council&mdash;and this is highly unlikely but it is placed in the bill&mdash;refuses to lease that land back to the ANPWS, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has the power to enforce that lease agreement. But I must say that we could not imagine such an occurrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal community will have a continuing say in the park's management through the board of management, on which the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council will have a majority. The remainder of the board will be made up of representatives from environment, tourism and government agencies, including the Director of the Australian Nature Conservation Agency. May I pay my respects to Mr Peter Bridgewater. He has discussed the legislation with me, and I know that he is very eager to see the bill go through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister has already mentioned, the handing over of Jervis Bay National Park to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community follows recommendation 315 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Recommendation 315 proposed that terms be negotiated between Aboriginal communities and national park authorities to protect and preserve the rights and interests of Aboriginal people with cultural, historical and traditional links with national park areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in passing that, whilst it has implemented recommendation 315, the government has failed to ensure the implementation of all the recommendations. The unfortunate result is that more Aboriginal people are dying in custody than ever before. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) discussed this issue on SBS the other night, and implied that the fault lay squarely with the states. I would like to draw the attention of the minister&mdash;unfortunately he is no longer in the chamber&mdash;to the statement of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Dodson. In his 1994 report, Mr Dodson described the government's first report into the recommendations of the royal commission as a:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . self-serving account of bureaucratic activity designed to bury failure in a sea of words . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition hopes that in its remaining days this government shows more commitment to the royal commission's recommendations than it has thus far. However we certainly endorse recommendation 315 and its application here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the legislative changes that grant land to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council, the council has also sought some administrative changes to the act which allow it to operate more effectively. The coalition believes that these administrative changes will allow the council to operate with a greater degree of efficiency and so will aid self-determination. I have already paid tribute to the council in the way that it has pursued its objectives in this area and has brought the changes to all political parties in this parliament to ensure that the changes had the support of all parties and went through without question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administrative changes allow the council to undertake general capital works, provide community service, protect and conserve natural cultural sites, engage in land use planning and conduct business enterprises. These changes also increase the amount the council can authorise from $1,000 to $100,000. Currently the council has a budget of over $1 million, with enormous responsibilities, including providing housing, sewerage and roads to the community. The coalition has agreed to the legislative change because it believes that it would be unworkable to have a limit of $1,000 before ministerial approval is needed, not to mention a great deal of paternalism. This figure is acceptable, as it follows other examples such as Tiwi Bathurst and Melville islands and the central and northern land councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes also provide for a provision, when there is no quorum, for AGMs to be recalled with a lower quorum at a later date. I understand the council has had difficulty in getting the size of quorum it needed for its AGMs and what we have here would appear to be a rolling system of AGMs which keep going until there are actually the numbers that are required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes alter the term of an executive from one year to two. Although I must admit this is not a major issue, I did have some concerns about it but was convinced by the council that it was important for them to actually get work done and not to face election every year, and it enables the council to make by-laws which can be disallowed by either house of parliament. This power to make by-laws allows the council to act similarly to any local council. The community council will then be able to act for the benefit of the community in relation to housing, education and health. The council will be able to prioritise its needs to best suit the interests and wellbeing of the community. These by-laws will help protect and preserve the cultural, sacred and environmental needs of the community and the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the lease agreement the current rights of leaseholders are preserved and unaffected by this claim, while the rights of other residents, including those stationed on the naval base at Jervis Bay, are preserved by the Commonwealth. The coalition has consulted widely on this matter to ensure that all parties agree with the land claim and the lease-back arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the readers of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, I would like to mention that Jervis Bay is located on the south coast of New South Wales, 160 kilometres from Sydney and 130 kilometres east of Canberra. We do tend to presume in this place that everybody is familiar with the areas we are talking about, but I know that my constituents in South Australia would not be familiar with the region. Apparently 85 per cent of the territory has been declared national park, while a separate area of just over 400 hectares is Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act 1986. The remaining land is set aside for a naval base and private leasehold land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Jervis Bay territory was acquired by the Commonwealth from New South Wales in 1915 under the Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act in accordance with the Seat of Government Act 1908. For more than 20,000 years Jervis Bay has been occupied by Aboriginal people. I am very curious about this figure of 20,000 as I am aware Aboriginal history in this country goes back 40,000 years, so I wonder whether this figure is not wrong and whether indeed, rather than 20,000 years, that should read 40,000. But at the moment the figure I have before me is 20,000 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wreck Bay community comprises descendants of seven language groups on the south coast region of New South Wales. They are traditionally fishing people who, until the late 1980s, operated a fleet of net fishing boats. Overfishing of the area by commercial operators has diminished the fish supply in the area; however, a community member has retained a commercial fishing licence and a number of the people in the community supplement their diet and income by fishing. At present there are approximately 200 members of the Wreck Bay community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Jervis Bay Botanic Gardens were opened in 1974 as an extension to Canberra's National Botanic Gardens, and the Jervis Bay National Park was opened in March 1992. The Wreck Bay Aboriginal community has had an informal reserve status for most of the century. An area of land for the community was formally gazetted in 1950, and in 1965 the control of Wreck Bay was transferred from the New South Wales Aboriginal Protection Board to the Commonwealth Department of the Interior. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1971 the Jervis Bay Nature Reserve was proclaimed over the majority of the Jervis Bay Territory and in 1986 just over 400 hectares of freehold land was granted to the Wreck Bay community under the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act. As a result of that act the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council was formed to administer the land in the best interests of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has consulted with the Shoalhaven council, which supports the agreement and hopes that tourism can be boosted in the Shoalhaven area by having an indigenous theme in the national park. At present $300 million is generated through tourism in the Shoalhaven district, making it the second largest industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wreck Bay council currently runs a business enterprise named `Walkabouts', which caters for groups who want to learn about the history, culture and traditions of the Wreck Bay community. Four types of tours are offered under Walkabouts: fishing history, campfire talks, bush tucker, and bush medicine and animal spotlight walks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint management of Jervis Bay National Park is a positive recognition of the Wreck Bay community's lengthy association with the land and waters within the Jervis Bay Territory. The coalition and the Wreck Bay community believe that the joint management arrangements will preserve the culture and traditions of the community, protect that community's traditional rights, secure an economic base to develop the Wreck Bay community and enable it to ultimately become self-sufficient and provide employment and training opportunities for all members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employment and training of Aboriginal people is vital. They remain the most disadvantaged group in Australia's labour market, and it has been distressing to see that over the last five years we have actually seen an eight per cent drop in employment amongst Aboriginal people or, to phrase it more correctly, there has been an eight per cent increase in unemployment amongst Aboriginal people. I understand, from my consultation with the Wreck Bay community, that several community members already work in the national park and that, following the handover of land, additional strategies will be in place to train and employ further Aboriginal people in park management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enthusiasm of the Wreck Bay community to participate in the joint management of lands is commendable. This bill goes a long way towards the reconciliation process, which we must all acknowledge has been&mdash;and will continue to be&mdash;a difficult one for Aboriginal people. All members I think would like to see more of these types of agreements, which will hasten that reconciliation process, not just for the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community but for all Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention that this bill makes an amendment to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 to enable the commission to inquire into&mdash;and report to the minister on&mdash;the granting of financial assistance for the financing of works and services in certain Australian territories. The coalition has consulted with the Norfolk Island government, which has said that it has no problem with this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by congratulating the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community and the Aboriginal community council.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to say a few words today, it has been rather fascinating to see the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) in the House making what I consider to be a rather pathetic and hypocritical effort to pull the banks into order. Having said that, and in fairness to him, at least he has had the courage to attempt to do something&mdash;he is one of the few people in this place. It amazes me that there is such pressure on people who have come from a state house to conform. John Pilger coined the important phrase `the secret country'; this is a similar phrase to Donald Horne's phrase `the lucky country'. They should become part of the Australian lexicon. It is remarkable that this country is still able to work as a democracy in the light of its primitive, antiquated, defamation laws. If honourable members have ever stuck their necks out on odd occasions as I have, they would have realised that the protection afforded to them by the House is negligible and that is why the scene was set in Australia for the great tragedy of the 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went into the 1980s with an annual bankruptcy rate of about 4,000 people: about 4,000 people were going bankrupt every year in Australia. In the golden period of Australia, the late John McEwen's period in Australian history, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, there were 2,000 bankruptcies a year. There was 1.5 per cent unemployment. We had the highest wages of any country in the world, the highest growth in wages anywhere in the world and the highest growth in population possibly anywhere in the world. We were the golden country in the golden age and we were quite rightly called `the lucky country' in those days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were 2,000 bankruptcies a year at that time and there were 4,000 when Mr Keating and Mr Hawke were elected. Within a period of about six years, through such brilliant initiatives as the deregulation of the banks, there was a complete reversal. When I voted against the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, three Labor staffers from this place rang me. They said that the only person to vote against the sale was a Tory. They said that this was at the very heart of their Labor beliefs. There was nothing more at the heart of Labor belief than the ownership of the Commonwealth Bank and the control and sovereignty of our nation's financial institutions. Without the Commonwealth bank, as far as I am concerned and as far as many Australians are concerned, the right to that sovereignty has been eroded and may be eroded to such an extent that it no longer substantially exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1980s, we went from 4,000 bankruptcies per year fairly swiftly; in about five or six years, we were hitting 15,000 bankruptcies per year&mdash;it might have been within seven or eight years&mdash;and we have stayed at that figure. In fact, the last quarterly figures still seemed to be looking at an average annual rate of 15,000. For every bankruptcy that occurs, the economists tell us that there are 20 businesses that go broke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I know very few people who have taken technical bankruptcy. I would probably only be able to name about four or five. If you were to ask me how many people I know who have gone broke, I would just go through everybody I know. It is very hard to find a business that is trading successfully these days. If we are talking about even a 10-figure number, that is 150,000 Australian families who go broke every single year. To sheet it home to where this came from, people borrowed money at the end of the 1970s and at the start of the 1980s at an 8 1/2 per cent interest rate. These people worked out, as a lot of people did&mdash;as I most certainly did&mdash;that maybe the interest rates could go to 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say from personal experience is that, in our last year on our station property, which was our business, we were paying 29 per cent interest rates. What happens is, of course, that you get pushed into overdraft because you cannot meet the interest payments, and the overdraft rates contain a punitive charge. It always amazes me that, with the banks, when you are in trouble and you need a bit of assistance they go the other way. They bung an extra four or five per cent upon you because you are in a danger zone. That took us to the ridiculous figure of 29 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some degree, I praise the member for Lilley for at least having the courage to say something. But it amazes me that he would tinker around the edges and talk about bank charges, when the banks have for almost a decade taken 15 per cent interest rates to which they were not even remotely entitled. I walked into the bank in the period when people were paying 15 and 17 per cent interest rates and, if you lodged money with the banks, you could get 6 1/2 per cent. We had from the banks the highest split of any country on earth between investment moneys and lending moneys, and this was allowed to continue for 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason it was allowed to continue was that the deregulation of the banks enabled a whole lot of charlatans to profit in this country&mdash;the corporate cowboys or `bold riders', as Trevor Sykes called them in his book of the same name, which is one of the great books that people should read. To understand what happened in Australia in the 1980s and the 1990s, you must read that book. He names 16 men in Australia who got away with $17,000 million. They were lent that money by the banks, entirely unsecured. When the banks went to foreclose, they foreclosed on nothing. All of the cargo containers were empty. All of the assets were gone, stripped away from the company. </PARA>

The whole $360 million was gone. A delightful article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>, referring to Janet Holmes a Court, said the figure of $360 million was wildly exaggerated, and that it was only $160 million that the taxpayers had lost.

Further on in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The bold riders</EMPHASIS>, Sykes said that in a very short period of time the banks lost to such people a figure in excess of $28,000 million. These were substantiated figures. He gives the details of the figures in the book. When the banks lost all that money, they had to get it back from somebody, but they had not been quite so reckless with the small business, the owner-operator, the family business and the farmer in Australia. Oh, no! The banks had those loans secured, all right. They had the securities over people's own houses, so such people lost not only their businesses but also their homes. </PARA>

They walked away with debts hanging over their shoulders of $50,000 or $100,000 or, in some cases, $200,000. These courageous Australians have worked tenaciously to try and work their debt off&mdash;which is, of course, entirely impossible: they will carry that debt for the rest of their days. If they have a windfall later on somewhere down the track, the bank can come back and take everything away from them once again. So their lives are wrecked, ruined and destroyed. </PARA>

When that situation was completely destroyed by the deregulatory policies of the incoming Labor government in the early 1980s, we went into a situation of absolute disaster, exactly as we did in the Great Depression in Australia when Theodore's advice was ignored.

This report reviews the 1993-94 annual report of the Reserve Bank and the 1993-94 annual report of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, and I speak as a member of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to start by making some very brief remarks about the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), who is a longstanding member of the committee. I have been a member of the committee since my election and Mr Braithwaite seems to have been a member of the committee forever. This is his last term and&mdash;I echo the comments of the member for Chifley (Mr Price)&mdash;the member for Dawson can be rightly proud of the contribution he has made to the parliamentary scrutiny of this area of policy. The member for Dawson is a member whom I hold in high regard, he is a member of great integrity, and his departure will be a loss to the committee and the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three issues that I will comment on this morning, two of which are raised directly by the committee's report and one which I will take the opportunity to mention in passing. The first relates to the question of derivatives, the second relates to the question of bank fees and charges, and the third relates to regional banking, which is a matter of some interest to me as a member from Western Australia where, in recent days, we have seen the Trade Practices Commission approve the takeover of Challenge Bank by Westpac and the announcement by the state Liberal government of the sale of the state bank, Bankwest&mdash;the old R&amp;I&mdash;to the Bank of Scotland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I comment firstly about derivatives. I mentioned that the committee's report reviews not only the Reserve Bank's annual report for 1993-94 but also the ISC's annual report. That arises as a direct result of concern to ensure that, after the Baring Brothers crash earlier this year, systems were in place in Australia to ensure that a crash of a similar nature could not occur here or at least that the risks of that were minimised. In respect of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the committee has formally recommended that the Treasurer monitor the implementation of the ISC's proposal for the use of derivatives by superannuation funds and report to parliament on progress at the first opportunity in 1996. That recommendation arises as a result of some concern on the part of the committee that the regulation of derivatives in the insurance and superannuation area is not as rigorous as it is so far as the banks are concerned under the supervision of the RBA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will comment on the good news before the bad news and deal with the review that the committee conducted so far as banks' handling of derivatives is concerned. The report outlines that, after the Baring Brothers crash, the committee resolved to establish a subcommittee&mdash;which I chaired and which the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) and the member for Dawson were members of&mdash;to conduct public hearings with both the Reserve Bank and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission in respect of derivatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the reason I drew the short straw to chair the subcommittee was that I also chair the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, which has been very active in this area following the Barings crash. In recent months, that committee has conducted public hearings with the Australian Stock Exchange, the Sydney Futures Exchange, the Australian Securities Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. I am expecting that it will be able to report to both houses of parliament in the course of October or November of this year and complement the report which the House of Representatives banking committee has made in this area in respect of RBA supervision and supervision by the ISC of the use of derivatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is true to say, and it is reflected by the committee's report, that at the public hearing members of the subcommittee were entirely satisfied that the Reserve Bank had these matters in hand or under control, but that that same confidence was not expressed or held by the subcommittee after its public hearing with the ISC. I now refer to a number of paragraphs in the committee's report which I think highlight that sentiment. The committee's report on derivatives is found at chapter 3. Paragraph 3.5 gives an indication as to the nature and use of derivatives and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Derivatives are instruments which are used primarily to manage risk, they are a form of insurance against adverse movements in market prices. The demand for risk-management instruments by both financial institutions and corporate users has led to the development of more complex derivative products. The high notional principal values involved, together with the potential for volatility, has resulted in public disquiet over the use of derivatives.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading `Risk management', the committee's report refers to the steps that the Reserve Bank has in place to ensure that banks have reasonable controls in place in respect of derivative activity. Paragraph 3.15, where the committee is referring to a survey conducted by the Reserve Bank, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the survey, the Reserve Bank was satisfied that banks had reasonable controls in place to manage derivatives activities, but that further work would continue in direct discussion with individual banks. A program of visits to banks commenced in late 1994. The purpose of the visits was to review banks' derivatives activities and risk management. The Bank set a number of objectives for the visits program: to increase understanding of how banks managed the risks associated with derivatives; to provide a greater insight into the models used by banks to measure their exposure to risk; and to require corrective action if deficiencies were found in those models. The Reserve Bank is focussing the visits on those banks which account for the bulk of derivatives business in Australia and expects to have visited about 20 banks by the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA>At paragraphs 3.21 and 3.22, the committee states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main risk for a bank is a loss associated with the failure of a customer and exposures to individual customers are monitored closely by banks. Many of the well publicised cases of derivatives losses in recent years have been among companies (Barings being the exception) which have not posed a threat to the financial system as a whole. The RBA also made the point that while derivatives markets can be volatile, trading in these markets is tightly controlled by the Futures Exchange with strict rules for lodgement of margins and for "circuit breakers" in trading . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.22  The RBA also pointed out that despite recent shocks such as the share market crash in 1987, the fall in bond prices in 1994 and the recent collapse of Barings, the financial markets have held up well and that derivatives have in fact caused fewer problems for banks than some normal businesses such as lending for commercial property.</PARA>
<PARA>Those comments from the RBA and the committee put the issue of systemic risk in context. At the end of chapter 3&mdash;at 3.45&mdash;the report concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is satisfied that the Reserve Bank has adopted a responsible and thorough approach in dealing with the potential risk that derivatives could pose to the stability of the financial system. The Committee also acknowledges that this process is on-going and that it is essential that the supervisory response continues to evolve to meet the change in nature and growing use of derivatives instruments.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is an accurate reflection of the views of the subcommittee, which were formulated following the public hearing with the Reserve Bank. As I have indicated, that same degree of confidence is not displayed in respect of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, and this is an area of some concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's comments in paragraph 3.46 stand in stark contrast to the attitude that the committee takes in respect of the RBA. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supervision of the banking industry is much more detailed than that of the insurance and superannuation industries. While the Committee endorses the approach of the ISC, the regulatory regime with regard to superannuation and insurance is still being formulated. The growing importance of superannuation requires that the ISC ensure that the process initiated with the release of the discussion papers be advanced as a matter of priority. The Committee was particularly concerned at the lack of data available on the use of derivatives by superannuation funds and will consider further examining the ISC's progress in this matter when it receives the ISC's 1994-95 annual report.</PARA>
<PARA>My personal view, which is not necessarily shared by the committee&mdash;I know it is shared by the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) and he will not mind if I volunteer it for him&mdash;is that that process is absolutely essential and that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration needs to be paying assiduous attention to the initiatives of the ISC in this area to ensure that in the area of superannuation the same high standard is met, so far as risk management regimes are concerned, as we find in respect of the banks and the Reserve Bank. Those comments of concern by the committee are best found in paragraph 3.37 of the committee's report which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned at the lack of knowledge about the use of derivatives in the superannuation industry in particular. The ISC advised that `the use of derivatives by life insurance companies, superannuation funds and general insurance companies in an overall context is relatively small. Apart from a general feeling, I cannot give you any further guidance.'</PARA>
<PARA>The committee was not satisfied that a general feeling which could not give further guidance was a satisfactory response where the management of insurance and superannuation funds is concerned. At paragraph 3.39 the committee reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ISC should place a high priority on finalising the new regulatory approach for the use of derivatives by superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA>Those concerns and comments led to the committee's formal recommendation that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) report to parliament on these improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move from the area of derivatives to make some brief comments on bank fees and charges. The committee's report makes it clear that, as a result of the review into bank fees and charges by the PSA, the committee would not delve into that area in any great length or at all. I draw to the attention of the committee what I regard as the most important paragraph in the Prices Surveillance Authority report on bank fees and charges, which is found on page 28 of the executive summary and recommendations, where the following comment is made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, the Authority is confident that market processes will deliver appropriate outcomes for consumers. If ready access to RTAs is not maintained in the future, however, it will be necessary for Government to act because ready access is a necessary part of modern-day living. Whilst a regulated basic banking product is not necessary today, the option remains one for Government to consider in the future if necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>What that makes clear, which is the point that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has recently been making, is that, if the banks do not provide an appropriate and timely response to the PSA report, the banks can expect re-regulation in this area. I have previously complimented the Treasurer on what I regard as his fine work in this area, which stands in stark contrast to comments that have been made by members opposite, particularly by the shadow minister for finance and my colleague from Western Australia, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), who has said that there should be no re-regulation in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deputy chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration, the member for McPherson, Mr Bradford, in the public hearing before the ABA which was part of the committee's work, was absolutely craven in his defence of the banks in this area. He said words to the effect that the antipathy towards the banks on this issue was a considerable overstatement and then gave a craven apology for them. In recent times, the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, has publicly indicated that he does not believe re-regulation is appropriate in this area either. That stands in stark contrast to the attitude taken by members on this side of the House and we look forward to timely and appropriate responses to the PSA's report and to the Treasurer's requests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by touching very briefly on the question of regional banking. I was severely disappointed that the government of Western Australia could not find the wit, the wisdom or the capacity to bring about a merger between Challenge Bank and the Bank of Western Australia to ensure a strong regional bank for Western Australia. We now run the grave risk that there will be no effective regional bank in Western Australia, given the takeover of Challenge by Westpac and the wholesale disposal of the Bank of Western Australia to the Bank of Scotland. I regard this as a great lost opportunity which lies at the feet of the state government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this report. My first comments are in relation to the recommendation that the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration inquire into the effectiveness of alternative dispute resolution between clients and banks. The Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman, Ms Sue Brooks, was appointed in May 1994 and the main office is in Melbourne. The ombudsman deals only with complaints from individuals, and in matters involving sums no greater than $100,000. Those complaints mainly concern errors that the banks have made. Last year there were approximately 30,000 complaints lodged; 10 per cent of those were considered, and of those only 20 to 30 per cent actually went before the ombudsman. The remaining complaints were resolved between the bank and the client.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank objected to the committee's recommendations that the $100,000 limit be extended to $200,000 and that not only individuals, but small companies, small businesses and farmers be able to lodge complaints to the ombudsman. Such an expansion of the scheme seems to work well overseas. I see no reason why it could not work well here, and I support that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mediation may also be looked at. A farm mediation bill was passed by the previous New South Wales parliament. That bill was a response to the heavy-handed treatment that was being meted out to some farmers, many of whom come from my electorate. Unfortunately there are a number of deficiencies in that state bill. It raised a very high expectation that things would occur which have not yet occurred, although it is too early to fully judge the effectiveness of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anecdotal evidence coming into my office suggests that the bill may be more advantageous to the banks than to the farmers who are actually in trouble. I am hearing stories of farmers who have gone through mediation, and who now find that, if they violate any of the agreements that have been put in place at the end of the mediation process, the banks can move immediately to sell them up without any fuss. That was surely not the intention when the bill was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that there are farmers who will always be in trouble, even in good seasons and when prices are high. But I am talking about a great percentage of farmers who are now finding themselves in difficulty, largely through circumstances outside their control, such as drought and low commodity prices. In my electorate, banks are selling up what most people would believe to be viable farms, and this is not always in the interests of the banks themselves. These fire sales bring in less money for the banks to repay their debt than they would otherwise receive if they stuck with the farmers for a longer period. Also, if the sales are forced and the prices brought are lower than expected, this collapses the equity for the neighbouring farmers and puts them in trouble with their banks. The banks should be very mindful of these factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have constituents who have been able to meet every interest payment due to the bank and have recommendations from their own rural counsellors stating that theirs are viable farms and should be allowed to continue, yet the banks are moving in and selling them up. I find it quite remarkable that the banks want to do that. Banks are there to make money for their shareholders and they make money, primarily, by lending money to others. If the banks are lending money to farmers and the farmers are meeting the interest payments and have got good prospects of being able to repay the principal in the future, the reason the banks are moving in and selling them up in the way they are is a puzzle indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had wool prices come off 20 to 30 per cent over the last couple of months. Cattle prices are down. The outlook for cattle on the American market is very grim, in the short to medium term. We have had recent collapses in wheat and barley prices, particularly in the last season. Overriding all this is one of the worst droughts, if not the worst drought, in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are distributing food parcels in my electorate. Here we are, in 1995 in an affluent, First World country, and some farmers in my part of the world are surviving, in part, on food parcels. Yet the banks are acting in this fashion. The worst offender&mdash;in my area, at least&mdash;is the Commonwealth Bank. That is closely followed by the State Bank and, to a lesser extent, Westpac. The ANZ and the National Australia Bank have also been at fault on occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just give one example. I had a farming family come to me the other day. In 1989, they owed the bank $1.8 million and were paying $278,000 a year in interest payments. They met those payments. Over the last six years, they have reduced their debt from $1.8 million to $700,000. Their interest payment has fallen to $78,000 a year. So they have been able to reduce their interest payments, they have been able to reduce their principal repayments and they have met every interest payment. Yet the bank has forced them into mediation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural counsellor says they are a good prospect if the bank will only hold off, for a couple of years, on insisting on further principal repayments. In the meantime, of course, they will continue to meet their interest payments. But the bank has forced them into mediation. Why would the bank do this? This happened to be the Commonwealth Bank, which had a notorious manager in the town of Nyngan who went into hotels and clubs and met clients on the footpath of the street, almost forcing loans on these farmers. I fully acknowledge it takes two to tango, but these people were led to believe, with the advice that they were getting, that they could take up these loans and meet the repayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened, of course, was that those who did take up the loans suddenly found that the interest payments had blown out from of the order of 14 per cent into the 20 per cent levels, and found themselves in difficulty. When this manager was moved on, the bank moved in&mdash;in a ruthless fashion, in many instances&mdash;on the people who had taken out these loans. This particular family is one case in point. It has been able to meet the principal repayments and the interest payments, yet the bank is forcing it into mediation, at a time when this particular family&mdash;living in division A of the Nyngan Rural Lands Protection Board&mdash;is surviving through probably close to the worst drought on record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing I would like to see the committee look at is the penalty rates that banks charge when farmers and small businesses find themselves in difficulty. This is commonly of the order of about 2 1/4 per cent or more. I had an instance recently where a client had an increase in their interest rates of 6 1/4 per cent, because they had moved into a higher risk category. It is somewhat paradoxical, I believe, that the bank charges higher interest rates because they move into a higher risk category. The bank itself adds to that very risk. In fact, the bank almost guarantees that these people will go to the wall. I do not think it is in the bank's interest to be charging such high penalty rates. It guarantees failure, in many instances. I believe this is an area which the committee should look at very closely indeed in its future deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another contentious area is fees and charges&mdash;probably the worst area, where banks are concerned. Although banks have improved their practices in recent years, people often come to my office with stories about how they have taken out a loan and have asked for the full fees and charges to be disclosed. However, three or six months into their loan, they find that there are other fees and charges that have somehow suddenly crept in. These fees and charges add two, three and four per cent interest to their overall interest payments. I believe that these fees and charges should not be hidden but should be up-front, simple and easily calculated by the people who are taking out the loans. As I say, people come to my office with such stories and complain about these things. I believe that a modern computerised bank should be able to get its act together in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that there should be better competition between banks. If a small business or a farmer has a loan and gets offered a better rate of interest by another bank or lending institution, they should be able to swap relatively easily and simply, without excessive penalties being put in place. I realise that, if a bank has lent money and if a person wants to withdraw from a loan, some penalty has to be applied. We have heard of cases where three months interest has been charged to transfer a loan from one client to another, when a few hundred dollars would probably suffice in this modern electronic age. Three months interest may have been all very well in the 1920s when interest rates were in the order of four or five per cent. But, today, when they are 10 and 15&mdash;and, as they have been in the past, 20 and 25&mdash;per cent, three months interest means that you cannot swap your loan from one bank to another even though it might be offering two or three per cent less, because, by the time you have paid the penalty, this has, in effect, eliminated all competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have some concern with the deals that the banks are doing with some farmers. I believe that the way in which banks operate with farmers and small business should be open and above board, and the same rules should apply to all players in the same circumstances. But, in case after case, people tell me that they have gone to their bank and asked for the best deal possible for their circumstances. They have been given a deal by the bank. They have then gone out and spoken to another farmer or small business person who has got a better deal at another bank. These people then go back to their original bank and say, `Hey, my neighbour has got this deal at two per cent less' or whatever, and the bank immediately comes to the party and offers them the same deal. If they had not talked to the other person, they would not have learnt of that. An extra two or three per cent off your loan is very significant in these hard times. The criteria should be spelt out and should be much more visible than they presently are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that banks are writing off large amounts of money for some clients who are in difficulty, simply because they are very vocal in the community, whereas other clients who have done the right thing by dealing honestly and openly with their bank do not get the same deal, even though they are in a better financial position. The people who have been getting these large write-offs are sworn to secrecy, so there is no openness about it. In these times, when the rural community is suffering enough, it is not a healthy situation to have these whispering campaigns and to have one neighbour being played off against another neighbour. I would like to think that the banks would consider that, when they are dealing with clients in the future. I see it constantly: it is not an infrequent thing; it is happening all the time. I am not one who comes in here to bash banks: I believe banks have served this country well; they have served their clients well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not one who would deny banks a profit. I do not get twitchy when banks make a profit; I get alarmed when they make losses. That aside, many practices seem to be creeping into the way in which banks deal with their clients, and they are causing a lot of dissension. I believe that people have legitimate complaints about banks in this regard and that it is actually in the interests of the banks to get their house in order in this area, to be more visible and up-front, and to deal more honestly with their clients. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since its election in 1983, the Labor government has radically transformed the landscape of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in this nation. In so doing, we have effectively raised policy issues pertaining to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from a 10th order issue under the Fraser coalition government to a first order issue under the Keating Labor government. The government's commitment to a socially just society&mdash;where all Australians, regardless of their race, sex or colour, are able to achieve their full potential and participate equally as citizens in a multicultural society&mdash;forms the building block upon which this government has formulated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy. </PARA>

In so doing, the commission made 339 recommendations which, in their implementation, traverse legislative and administrative spheres of the three tiers of government in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, the legislation before the House today seeks to amend the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act 1986, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 and the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973, to facilitate the attainment of recommendation 315 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which I have already mentioned. In this context, recommendation 315&mdash;also known as the `Millstream' recommendation, framed by the Aboriginal delegates to a 1990 conference in the Millstream-Chester National Park&mdash;deals specifically with initiatives to protect and reserve the rights and interests of Aboriginal people with cultural, historical and traditional associations with national parks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key initiatives outlined under recommendation 315 include the encouragement of joint management between identified and acknowledged representatives of Aboriginal people and the relevant state or national agency; the involvement of Aboriginal people in the development of management plans for national parks; the excision of areas of land within national parks for use by Aboriginal people as living areas; the granting of access by Aboriginal people to national parks and national reserves for subsistence hunting, fishing and collection of material for cultural purposes; and the facilitation of the control of cultural heritage information by Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key initiatives also include the negotiation of lease-back arrangements which enable title to land on which national parks are situated to be transferred to Aboriginal owners, subject to the lease of the area to the relevant state or Commonwealth authority on payment of rent to the Aboriginal owners; the reservation within national parks of areas of land to which Aboriginal people have access for ceremonial purposes; the establishment of mechanisms which enable relevant Aboriginal custodians to be in control of protection of, and access to, sites of significance to them; and the charging of admission fees for entrance to national parks by tourists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments outlined in the bill before the House today put into effect the key initiatives of recommendation 315 and reflect the government's position as a pacesetter in dealing with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy issues derived from the royal commission report. Indeed, similar initiatives relating to Aboriginal community land management and lease-back arrangements already exist within the Kakadu and Uluru national parks. In this context, this bill builds upon the foundation that has already been laid by the successful implementation of lease-back and land management arrangements at Kakadu and Uluru in order to facilitate a similar success within the confines of the Jervis Bay territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All available historical research evidence indicates that there have been Aboriginal settlements in Jervis Bay for at least 20,000 years. In this context, Wreck Bay, which is located within the confines of the Jervis Bay territory, has been the focal point of Aboriginal settlement for much of the last century. In the 1950s, the area of land which the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community had been inhabiting in an informal reserve type arrangement was formally gazetted as a reserve and in l965 the area was transferred to the control of the then Commonwealth Department of the Interior. After the majority of the Jervis Bay territory was proclaimed a nature reserve in 1971, the federal Labor government in l986 granted some 405 hectares as freehold title to the Wreck Bay community under the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In granting the freehold title to the Aboriginal community at Wreck Bay, the government, under the act, established a community council to exercise powers as owners of the land for the benefit of the members of the community. In this context, I would submit that to date these arrangements have seen the Wreck Bay community council operate as a model community, which will no doubt be reflected in the future land management aspects of the bill before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I would like to turn to the key amendments specifically outlined in the bill before the Main Committee today, and to draw out the implications that will flow from the future enactment of the bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments pertaining to the 1986 act will enable the national park and the botanic gardens which are within the confines of the park to be granted to the Wreck Bay community council. Such a grant of land would be subject to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs being satisfied of the significance of the area to the Aboriginal community and entry into a formal agreement to lease the land back to the director of National Parks and Wildlife Service. Further to this, the community council will be empowered to make by-laws with respect to the land granted to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments relating to the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act 1986 meet a number of the key initiatives of recommendation 315 of the royal commission. In this context, the negotiation of a lease-back arrangement with the director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service&mdash;when combined with the community council by-laws power which allows Aboriginal people to deal with issues such as the protection and conservation of flora and fauna found on Aboriginal land, the declaration of sacred or significant sites on other areas of significance to Aboriginal people on Aboriginal land, hunting, shooting and fishing on Aboriginal land, control of visitors in, and charging fees for entrance to, Aboriginal land, and economic enterprise and cultural activities on Aboriginal land&mdash;provides a number of the mechanisms required to facilitate the successful implementation of recommendation 315. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The by-laws outlined above certainly provide the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community with significant control of their ancestral lands and in this context provide a sound basis to address the underlying causes outlined in the royal commission and the reconciliation issues being pursued by the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the arrangements to lease back the land encompassed by the national park and the botanic gardens, this amendment forms the basis of the cooperative land management arrangements between the Wreck Bay community council and the director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which were again highlighted in recommendation 315 of the royal commission, to which I have already referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangements will ensure that broad community access to the national park will be maintained and that any person's existing legal right or interest in land granted to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community will also be maintained. The lease-back arrangements outlined above tie into the second major raft of amendments which pertain to the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1975. In this context, the amendments are designed to enable the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council to participate in the management of the Jervis Bay National Park and Botanical Gardens if they are declared to be Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reflects the government's and the vast majority of the Aboriginal community's view that Aboriginal participation in the management and control of the conservation estate is fundamental to the acknowledgment of Aboriginal rights to land and the control of Aboriginal cultural heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To facilitate the joint management of these areas which may be declared to be Aboriginal land, the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1975 provides for the establishment of boards along the lines of those already in operation in the Uluru and Kakadu national parks. To this end, once land in the Jervis Bay National Park and Botanic Gardens is declared to be Aboriginal land, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) may establish a board for those areas once agreement is reached with the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board, which is established for the Jervis Bay National Park land, will comprise the majority of Aboriginal members nominated by the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land. In concert with the director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the board will develop a management plan for the park which will encompass a range of issues, including access, conservation, fire protection and the development and use of Aboriginal land. In this context, the board, in conjunction with the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council, will effectively utilise the skills and experience that the Aboriginal peoples have developed over time in the conservation and maintenance of natural resources and native flora and fauna in the Jervis Bay ecosystem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has set the pace when it comes to the development of viable land management arrangements between the traditional Aboriginal owners of land in national parks and reserves and the agencies charged under the Commonwealth legislation to effectively manage these lands. In this context, the Commonwealth, with the enactment of this legislation which is before us today, will have effectively laid the groundwork to hand over the last of the major national park and reserve lands to their traditional Aboriginal owners through the lease-back and land management arrangements that I have already outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, the ball will be in the court of the various state and territory governments who have parks and reserves which Aboriginal people have claims to in terms of entering into arrangements to provide for the joint management and lease-back of this land. I certainly hope that the states and territories will take up that challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn my attention to the last of the major amendments of this bill which pertain to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973. These amendments will enable the Commonwealth Grants Commission to inquire into grants for financial assistance, in terms of works and services, in respect of the Jervis Bay territory, amongst others. The inquiries made by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which, in turn, reports its findings to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, will not only assist in the development of appropriate facilities and services for the joint management of the land, but also facilitate efforts to further develop the commercial aspects of the park in a way which will not harm the fragile ecosystem and will benefit the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council, if it so desires, will be able to develop the ecotourism and cultural tourism potential of the Jervis Bay National Park. Access to funding for specific projects through the Department of Tourism and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission will also be a major benefit. The potential to generate income and business opportunities through the marketing of the area as a cultural tourism destination will have real benefits for the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community in terms of employment opportunities for Aboriginal people and the development of particular management skills associated with the tourism industry and associated businesses. And the revenue generated by the council could be ploughed back into the development of infrastructure and services which have been identified as being of benefit to the Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To sum up, the bill which is before the House today reflects this government's commitment to the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody as part of its overall strategy of ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander equity and reconciliation objectives. In this context, the bill before us today covers a large portion of the initiatives outlined under recommendation 315 of the royal commission report. In so doing, it addresses some of the underlying factors behind the excessive numbers of Aboriginal people who die in custody and, unfortunately, who are still dying in custody today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me emphasise that, while this bill is a step in the right direction, there is still much that needs to be done, not only in the implementation of the recommendations of the royal commission but also in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues more generally, right across this nation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been said, the Aboriginal Land Grant and Management (Jervis Bay Territory) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 before the House deals with the granting of land which is already primarily a national park to a group known as the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community. It does so for the purpose of giving them an involvement in land with which they have had a close association for many years. The extent to which that is a tribal association is, from my recollection, probably more expanded today than it was at the time when some original grants were made down in that area to the people who had resided there for many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will stand corrected by the next speaker, the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) as to the chronology of this issue, but I have a feeling that possibly the original grant was made when the Fraser government was still in office. I say that because I recollect discussing the issue. It was the first time, in the context of that grant, that I raised the question as to why we had to provide such people with inalienable freehold title, when it struck me that ordinary Australian title might have been more appropriate, since they were people who were going to live in houses on that property and it would appear to me that they should have had some right to buy and sell those houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This case is slightly different, because we are talking about an area designated as a national park, but I have stuck to the view&mdash;and I will continue to stick to it&mdash;that it is gross paternalism for us to say in one breath that the Aboriginal people have very close links with the land with which they have been associated and that they could not be trusted to keep that ownership if they were given the normal sort of title. We stand up here as a paternalistic group and say, `We will give you a title that you cannot deal in, borrow against or even move from.' I find that totally illogical when one considers the arguments as to why they should have the land in the first place, and I take every opportunity to put on record that I do not see it as a process that assists the people concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other little bit of history relates to the creation of the national park itself. Of course, the people of the area were rather sorely treated, because they had, to the best of my knowledge, quite properly used the beaches and the fishing spots of Jervis Bay for many years as an area of recreation; but, when it was declared a national park, the first thing we did was put up some boom gates and start taking money for the privilege of using the area. We never thought that the locals might have some rights, similar to those granted by local authorities, to a couple of free visits to the tip. I hope they were never using the park for that purpose, but the point is that, when we converted that land to a national park, people who lived within a reasonable distance and who had traditionally used it&mdash;and I stress those word `traditionally'&mdash;for their recreational swimming, sunbaking or fishing should have had some free access to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For quite some time, the people vented their anger on that arrangement by going out and smashing the windows of the entrance fee booths. If you travel there today, you will find steel shutters on all the booths. People were not very happy with what had been done. That is not an Aboriginal issue; that was because the area was made a national park and the traditional users of that area were denied the access to which they had been accustomed. But, of course, they were different people: they were just the taxpaying citizens of Australia, and we normally do not have a lot of care for them. I think that is worth putting on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am interested in this particular legislation because, as we have been advised, it follows the process that applied at Uluru, and that has proved quite successful. It does not suggest there is a lease payment&mdash;and I assume that is correct. Again, the parliamentary secretary or somebody else might like to tell me whether, in this process of granting the land to the Aboriginal people in the peculiar form of title that we have created, with the condition that they lease it back, there is any fee for that process&mdash;be it weekly, annually or lump sum. I am interested to know if that applies because it then talks about their rights to gain royalties from allowing timber cutting concessions. I am surprised about that. I did not think there would be much of that available but, irrespective of that, there is a focus on the community group obtaining revenue from this proposal. I do not object to that either. I just wanted to take the opportunity to talk a little bit about how such revenue might be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, in the case of this park, it would not be a significant sum of money, presumably, even in terms of the revenue that one might get from concessions of the nature referred to. But I note in the second reading speech that the council is to be given the power to enter into contracts involving payments by the council of up to $100,000 without the approval of the minister. That is not necessarily wrong either but somewhere or other there is substantial revenue involved in this process. I am assuming that the type of contract that might be let would improve the value of this national park. Whether that would be by cutting down some trees to build another road, I am not really sure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of it is that that would be an expenditure on the park, on the property, and one would have expected that the lessee&mdash;in this case the National Parks and Wildlife Service&mdash;would have been more inclined to those sorts of outlays. I understood that that sort of property improvement is more likely to emanate from that area, so I am not really sure what that is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I want to raise the question of revenue emanating from such facilities is that the minister also makes some reference in his second reading speech to some aspects of this legislation that parallel that which applies to the Northern Land Council. I do not think there is much doubt that the Northern Land Council receives substantial revenues from the Gove manganese mining operation, et cetera. For years I have been trying to find out how it spends that money because it is in the tens of millions. It is a body that does not publish a balance sheet but prepares a balance sheet, and no doubt is subject to some audit process. I think it does report to the minister. Our next speaker might be able to enlighten us because he was the minister at one time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Central Land Council for a number of years, on a much smaller revenue, something like about $4 million, used to publish its balance sheet. It was quite interesting because, year after year, the $4 million was spent. I could never identify any capital asset that was constructed with the money. In fact, most of it seemed to be spent on attending meetings. I would have thought&mdash;and this is the point I want to make&mdash;that where there is significant revenue coming from these grants of land it would normally in the wider community be the revenue of government, which would apply it to its hospital, education and other programs of that nature. I think we are entitled to know in this parliament where such revenue is expended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the money improves the amenity of a national park and its attraction to the public, that is a proper way to spend the money. If it creates wages for some of the participants, that is a proper way to spend the money. In the context of this particular legislation, that would probably be the end of it. When it is mining royalties and revenue such as the Northern Land Council gets I think there is an obligation on us as members of parliament to clearly bring a budget to the parliament so people can see and understand how that money is expended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of these grants of land rights and the income that might flow from that particular land-holding by way of royalty, there should be a clear commitment that the community will know how that money is being spent. There should be a role for government, having granted and conceded that right to a land council&mdash;a right that would otherwise create revenue for government&mdash;in giving some indication as to how the money might be expended in terms of lifting the living standards of the tribal group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are assailed in this parliament, day after day, about the problem of the health condition of Aboriginal people, and the Minister for Education, Employment and Training (Mr Crean) tells us about the dreadful state of Aboriginal education. I do not disagree that both of those statements of problems are correct, but they should not be a problem for the participants of the Northern Land Council, because they have tens of millions of dollars of revenue, and one would think that&mdash;with community ownership of land, land rights, and the right to levy royalties&mdash;they would not have that problem for their people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not have to go beyond their people, because there is not all that much money, and I say it is a tribal right because it is tribal land. But because there is a royalty base and, in any other situation, that royalty would flow to government, who would choose to direct some of it back into all these areas, there is a responsibility on the managers of that money to spend it in that way. From my observations of the living standards of the people whom they represent, they do not spend it in that way, and I am not sure how they do spend it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and we conducted certain inquiries, we ended up in Broome on one occasion, and the manager of a particular station property that was now Aboriginal land came to give us evidence. He was an Australian, but of European background, and he made the point that it was a profitable station, but that he could not get the owners to work on it. It is on the record somewhere from the time, because he gave evidence to our committee that, when he needed to muster and do other things, he had to go off the property to hire people to assist him in the conduct of the property. That is a tragedy, amongst other things, but it is also wrong, because&mdash;to use his words&mdash;the proprietors of that property preferred `sit-down money'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say that you could have a very large community living on one pastoral property and that they could all get a living out of it, because they could not. We know that, in this day and age, a normal single family unit has difficulty making sufficient profits out of some of these properties to sustain themselves, but that is after they have paid wages. It would seem ridiculous that people would be brought in to work on that property when the owners were not working and were, in fact, in receipt of unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a matter of evidence given to us at the time, and I really and truly think that, whether in this particular situation at Jervis Bay or the Northern Land Council&mdash;which probably gets more revenue than any other land council or similar body in Australia&mdash;there should be an accounting, and there should be an expectation that a substantial part of that revenue be paid out to improve those fundamental requirements relating to Aboriginal people: schooling, education, health and those types of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly did not gather that impression from the opportunity I once had but which I think is now denied me: I have not seen a published balance sheet of the Central Land Council for many years. But, for a long time, to their credit, they published it. They had at the time revenue of about $4 million dollars. I have never seen a balance sheet for the Northern Land Council. I know there are some people involved in that council who seem to have substantial trappings of wealth. That in itself is not a problem, as I do not see why they have to be poor, if they are the chief executive or the chairman or whatever else of that particular organisation. But, as a member of parliament, I would like to be guaranteed that when we make these grants and there is a revenue component&mdash;which I hope there is, because I do not think it is much good giving them desert and telling them that because they once lived there they should go back, because that is not the way our society operates today&mdash;it should be used well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just feel that we do need to see that substantial revenue streams which would otherwise be the property of government, be it state, federal or local, and would be spent in community development, should be done similarly but for the discrete group of people whose rights that land is for. You might jump and say that if you have got a pastoral property and it is freehold you can spend the money how you like. Pastoral property is not freehold, but let us say you have a large freehold farm: you can spend the money how you like. That is partially true, but the first thing that most people tend to do is pay private health insurance and they go out and pay to send their kids to school. They even contribute when they go to a state school. They certainly do not get their shoes bought for them and their clothes bought for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing wrong with requiring, or expecting, that that money, that revenue stream that flows into these communities because of these land grants, is used in a way that lifts the living standard of these people, and I think it amazing that within that Northern Land Council, with such substantial revenue streams&mdash;much bigger than most local authorities&mdash;there does not appear to be any improvement in the general living standards of the people involved. I think some of the people on Groote Eylandt, where they have their rights, are better off in terms of such things as motor cars and things of that nature. I have had recent reports emanating from the Kimberley of young people, and I mean juveniles, walking around with $3,000 and $4,000 in their pocket, and that is just heart-breaking if that is all that is being done with it. I am not saying this is the case, but I would find it tragic to think you had some kid sniffing on petrol with $1,000 in his pocket. I just do not think we are arriving at a solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes I have got left, I want to raise another issue of grave concern, the attempts of the federal government to intrude in an area of state administration, namely, the granting of land, and the consequent manoeuvrings illegally by which they have attempted to get around the constitutional issues, notwithstanding the views of the High Court on that. The legislation might be constitutional but it is so convoluted that it is now creating great administrative difficulty, and that was identified at the time by more reasonable commentators. The reality is that Aboriginals are not getting anything, business and those wishing to develop are getting very little, and I doubt there is anything that can be done of a legislative and constitutional nature in this place to fix it up because we lack the constitutional power, particularly as the constitution is so specific about the Commonwealth's role in land administration, where it says that if you want to do anything about land you must buy it. </PARA>

Therein lies the difference between the member for O'Connor and members on this side.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was the minister who had the responsibility for negotiating the first grant of land back to the Wreck Bay community and it was not a simple process. Two very distinguished ministers during the period of the Fraser government&mdash;Mr Ian Viner and Mr Fred Chaney&mdash;had previously tried and they were unsuccessful. They were unsuccessful largely because of the amount of land which was involved and because, basically, as ministers for Aboriginal affairs, they were not able to negotiate with the Minister for Lands and Territories to assure the size of the area of land that was offered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was fortunate in as much as I had as a minister Tom Uren and Tom Uren had a generosity of spirit and an attitude towards Aboriginal people which gave me a greater freedom. But these negotiations were complex&mdash;I do not know whether the honourable member for O'Connor has ever been to Wreck Bay&mdash;because even then the Wreck Bay community felt that they were not getting enough land. The situation got to the stage where I had to say to them, as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, `This is the best I can do. I can do no better and you will have to take it or leave it.' They decided to have a ballot. There was a group of people who belonged to the community but did not live within it. They were unhappy with this concept and they decided to put a ban on the ballot which meant that only those people who were resident in the community voted. On the basis of the vote the Wreck Bay community agreed to accept the offer. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might suit the honourable member for O'Connor to adopt the real estate approach, which is part of our culture. But you are dealing with a people to whom the land forms the basis of their spiritual being and of their essence. It is not something to be divided up into lots, to put signs on and to be sold, and then you wait for the market to go up and turn it over again. That is not what they are about. That is not what they have ever been about. And until that factor is not only recognised but understood by members like the member for O'Connor, they will continue to rant&mdash;and, in some cases, rave&mdash;about Mabo and about the whole concept of land rights because this is a concept of land and a perception of people's relationship to their land where they have duties to that land which is beyond their comprehension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It happens to be a fact that in relation to my own state of Victoria, we had to pass Commonwealth legislation to give back an area of land at Framlingham which would not make a decent sized farm. It was passed by the then Labor government; it was blocked by a Liberal majority in the Legislative Council, and the now Premier of Victoria&mdash;then Leader of the Opposition&mdash;embarked on what he decided was a mission to say to the people of the Western District that this was outrageous. Again, it is about different cultural concepts. Fortunately, the people of the Western District, who are not exactly young political radicals, knew that Aboriginal people had lived there for some time; they were not concerned and upset, and this `undertaking' was laughed out of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, we have a situation in Western Australia&mdash;and as far as I know the honourable member for O'Connor has never dissented from it&mdash;where the present Premier says that under no circumstances will he recognise Aboriginal land rights. That is at the core of some of the attitudes which are expressed. To give due respect, the Fraser government recognised that the process of reconciliation had to begin and, to its credit, implemented the recommendations of the Woodward commission. If the honourable member for O'Connor says he has never had access, or cannot get access, to the financial statements, accounts and balance sheets of the Northern Territory, I can only say that he cannot have tried. I think he only has to ask the minister who receives those and they would be available. They are not secret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emergence of ATSIC has placed heavy financial responsibilities upon that body to see that the funds that they receive are administered properly and effectively. But perhaps before I move to the other aspects of this that are worthy of mentioning, there is something I should say to the member for O'Connor. If he is worried about so-called wastage by the Northern Land Council, let me say this: I would share the view that they have had to waste a great deal of money, on many occasions, combating the attitude of the Northern Territory government when land right claims, which have been successful in the first instance, have been the subject of continuous challenge to the highest courts in the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about funds for education. If one were to take out a balance sheet on the costs of unsuccessful litigation, in the Northern Territory and other parts of Australia, to combat legitimate claims and aspirations of Aboriginal people which have already been processed through the relevant tribunals but end up in the High Court, one would be looking at a great deal of money, which could have been used to advance the interests of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of this is that, on any test, the granting of ownership to Aboriginal people in Kakadu has been successful. Uluru is still a major tourist attraction for Australian and overseas visitors. It has not been sold to any overseas developer; it has not been moved. It is still there, and the Aboriginal people who are its traditional owners are there, as they will always be. It is one of the places where they are successfully dealing with the tourist community. This is not to say that all problems have been solved, just as all problems in running some of the larger tourist facilities around Australia have not been solved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we can say is that at no stage have our political opponents been prepared to accept the reality of that decision. In the last federal election campaign, in the small print&mdash;as it had been in every election campaign previously&mdash;there was the stated intention of the opposition, if elected, to take away Uluru and give it back to the Northern Territory government. The terms and conditions which were attached to the grant of Uluru would make that a very expensive project indeed. But the fact that it was there is a blemish on the present opposition, because one can say, looking objectively at this very important land grant, that it has worked successfully, as the grant in this situation will perform for the Wreck Bay people. It will have a similar level of success and give them some level of governance over areas of land which, traditionally, they belong to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the important difference: we are recognising that simple fact. We are recognising that attachment to the land. I wish them well, and I commend the minister on this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will take a few minutes to conclude this debate, thank members for their contribution to it and respond to a number of issues that have been raised in the course of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my second reading speech on this matter I mentioned that the initiative is very much in line with recommendation 315 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Recommendation 315 of the royal commission was first of all a plea to the government of Western Australia to give effect to the recommendations of the Millstream conference held in that state. The Millstream conference recommendations put forward a broad charter of reform and involvement of Aboriginal people in national park management in appropriate cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those recommendations, although directed to the government of Western Australia, were first of all responded to by the Commonwealth in its draft response to the royal commission, with the Commonwealth picking up and endorsing the terms of that recommendation. As a result of that Commonwealth leadership, every state and territory government endorsed that recommendation. I am pleased to say that the return of Jervis Bay National Park to Aboriginal ownership is directly in line with the Commonwealth commitment given in response to that recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I must say in response to issues raised in the debate that there is still quite a way to go in respect of the actions of a number of the state governments to give effect to their commitments in response to recommendation 315. I can say to the chamber that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) and myself will be seeking to advance this agenda as a part of the government's response to the social justice recommendations put to us by ATSIC and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in relation to the government's third stage response to the High Court decision in the Mabo case. We want to work closely with the state and territory governments to advance recommendation 315. I am heartened by much of the debate and comment from the opposition in the course of debate on this bill that we can do so from at least the Commonwealth level with a large degree of cross-party support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a couple of other brief comments in concluding the debate. It is fortuitous that the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) is in the chamber as we conclude this debate because he shares, along with the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and myself and other colleagues, a commitment to advance the agenda of indigenous tourism. If I can just recount my own experience in this regard, my first trip to the Northern Territory was in 1975. Those were the days when my good friend, now senator from the Northern Territory, Senator Collins, was actively involved with the environment centre of the Northern Territory. Other people on that trip included the now Senator Coulter from the Australian Democrats. This was long before either of them became elected to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a then relatively young non-indigenous Australian, to visit Kakadu National Park before it was a national park, just to see the majesty of the rock art of Kakadu, was a very profound experience for me. It helped shape a lot of my views and attitudes with respect to how I think about Australia. In terms of a time line of human occupation of this continent, the fact is that non-indigenous occupation is but a speck in time compared with the 40,000 years or more of indigenous ownership of the continent. There is so much that non-indigenous Australians can learn from an understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and art. It is just such a magnificent contribution to the reconciliation process. I know this is an agenda that the minister in the chamber and other key ministers will seek to advance in the period ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am heartened by the recently foreshadowed initiatives of the New South Wales government to give effect to the now long outstanding unanimous report of the parliamentary committee in that state which recommended the transfer of key areas of national park land to Aboriginal ownership. I think that the unanimous parliamentary committee report should be supported, as it appears it will be, by the New South Wales government. I look forward to seeing tangible progress in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are coming up to the 10th anniversary of the return of Uluru to Aboriginal ownership. That event, for those people who were there, was a magnificent day. Indeed, one of the speakers in this debate, the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), was the minister at the time. That debate brought together a wide cross-section of Australian people in support of that action. Unfortunately, at that time, there was also a campaign against the return of Uluru to Aboriginal ownership. The then Northern Territory government had full-page newspaper advertisements in major newspapers across the country saying that Uluru belongs to all Australians and foreshadowing doom and gloom and terrible consequences if that national icon were returned to Aboriginal ownership. Of course, none of that came to pass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the work of the Australian government in this regard has been commended by UNESCO. It has been recognised as truly a model for the world. Uluru is one of the premier national and international tourist destinations in this country and it is enriched as a tourist destination because of the Aboriginal ownership and the Aboriginal involvement in the management of that very significant national park area. In conclusion, the message is that non-indigenous Australians have nothing to fear from initiatives of this kind and everything to gain. The initiatives will be seen, as they are I think now, as very proud reforms of our federal Labor government. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The Trade Marks Bill 1995 is the result of an extensive review of Australia's trademarks legislation that takes into account the significant public comment made on the proposed reforms and draft legislation. As well as repealing the Trade Marks Act 1955, it will repeal and replace the Trade Marks Act 1994, which has not yet come into force. I should imagine that many honourable members are wondering why the government is proposing to repeal and replace legislation that has only recently been enacted. Let me briefly explain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To enable Australia to accept the agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation, legislation that met Australia's obligations relating to trademarks under the WTO Agreement needed to be enacted. Rather than amend the existing Trade Marks Act 1955 to meet those obligations, the government felt that the most expedient approach would be to introduce into the parliament the Trade Marks Bill 1994, which had been released as an exposure draft early in 1994 and was essentially WTO consistent. However, the government was acutely aware of the signals that this course of action might send because it would preclude the 1994 bill from reflecting the results of public comment that had been sought on the exposure draft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the 1994 bill was introduced, the government took the opportunity to reiterate its publicly stated commitment to take into account public comment by introducing amending legislation at the earliest appropriate opportunity. I emphasise that this government has always been genuine in its commitment to take into account the views of interested parties, and this is reflected in this bill. However, because of the extensive nature of the changes that would be required to be made to the Trade Marks Act 1994, the government has decided that it would be simpler and more convenient for users of the trade marks system to repeal the 1994 act and replace it with consolidated legislation that users would find more accessible and comprehensible. The bill currently before the House does this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A trade mark serves to indicate the trade origin of goods or services. By granting the owner of a registered trade mark the exclusive right to use, or authorise others to use, their trade mark, Australia's trade marks law serves two complementary objectives&mdash;first, identification and protection of a business's products and, second, protection of the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the first objective, the value of a trade mark to its owner can be enormous in terms of the reputation and goodwill associated with the trade mark. For example, in its 1994 annual report, Pacific Dunlop valued its brands, including trade marks, at $319 million. Clearly, a registered trade mark, properly managed, can become a valuable asset of a business, an asset that can be sold, franchised out, licensed or used as security. As such, adequate protection of trade marks and other valuable intellectual property is vital for all innovative Australian enterprises. As part of its reforms to encourage innovation in Australian businesses, the government has sought to improve the overall efficiency of Australia's trade mark registration system and to meet the contemporary and future needs of Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the second objective, trade marks also provide certainty to consumers by indicating the trade source of goods or services. Through use, consumers can also come to associate a trade mark with the quality of a particular good or service. For example, referring again to the Pacific Dunlop products, the `Chesty Bond' singlet has become an Australian icon, because of people's experience over many years with that particular product. I am sure members of both sexes would agree with that comment. Because consumers make purchasing decisions based on the trade marks associated with goods or services, trade marks legislation, as well as trade practices and related legislation, provides appropriate checks and balances to ensure that use of trade marks do not deceive or confuse consumers. Quite obviously, trade marks are a vital link between the owner of the trade mark, the owner's products, and consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Australian firms become more export-oriented in an increasingly globalised marketplace, this link is perhaps even more important. International developments relating to trade marks, such as the recently concluded WTO Agreement and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) Trademark Law Treaty, reinforce the significant role that trade marks play in international trade. Against this international backdrop, several countries, including New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and South Africa, have recently undertaken major reviews of their national trade marks law. The government has due regard to these developments and has sought to harmonise Australia's trade marks system, as far as practicable, with similar systems of other industrialised countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Commonwealth first legislated on trade mark matters in 1905, there have been two other significant reviews. They occurred in 1938 and 1954, and resulted in the current Trade Marks Act 1955. In many respects this bill represents an evolution from, rather than a revolutionary change of, the 1955 Act. It refines and streamlines the current trade marks system, and updates it to reflect recent international developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill implements Australia's obligations under the WTO Agreement, but its main thrust is to implement the government's response to the July 1992 report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recommended changes to the Australian trade marks legislation</EMPHASIS>, as modified by the consultation process I have already mentioned. That report was prepared by the working party to review the trade marks legislation, which comprised representatives from the legal and patent attorney professions, industry and government. It was asked initially to review and streamline the trade marks legislation, but as the work progressed its objectives expanded to take into account the international developments already described. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The working party made 57 recommendations for change to Australia's trade marks system. Except for three recommendations relating to the so-called `association' of trade marks and the structure of the Trade Marks Register, the working party's recommendations were unanimous. The government accepted those unanimous recommendations. In regard to those recommendations on which the working party could not agree, the government decided that it would accept the minority recommendations of the working party in the interests of harmonising the law with international needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill currently before the House is, in many respects, the same as the Trade Marks Act 1994. I will briefly outline some of the more noteworthy features of the trade marks system that have been carried over from the 1994 act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the review which produced the 1955 act, the Trade Marks Register was divided mainly, it would seem, to conform with the British legislation then in force and to provide for registration of certain trade marks in part B for which the rights given up by registration would be limited. Unlike the 1955 act, the bill does not divide the Trade Marks Register. Under the WTO Agreement there is no distinction between trade marks with respect to the rights they acquire on registration, rather they are to be afforded a level of protection equivalent to that of the current part A registration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite a minority of submissions expressing concern about the register being undivided, the government remains convinced that the undivided register proposed in the bill will increase the efficiency of the registration process without adversely affecting the rights of trade mark owners. An undivided register will also harmonise Australia's trade marks law with those of other OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is expressed in terms that make it clear that there is to be a presumption of registrability when an application for registration is being examined by the Registrar of Trade Marks. This means that, if there is any doubt about whether a trade mark should be registered, that doubt will be resolved in favour of the applicant rather than against the applicant as is now the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill widens the test available for infringement of a registered trade mark. In particular, action for infringement of a trade mark will be possible when the trade mark is used without the owner's authority in association with goods or services similar to those in respect of which the trade mark is registered. At present, infringement proceedings may only be brought where the trade mark has been used without authority in association with the same goods or services for which the trade mark is registered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new, broader definition of what may constitute a trade mark is introduced by the bill. As a result, it will now be possible to register sounds, smells and aspects of packaging as trade marks provided that all the other requirements for registrability are met. This change is responsive to the contemporary and developing marketing needs of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also streamlines existing procedures under the trade marks system. The bill introduces multi-class applications which will obviate the need to file separate applications for each class of goods or services for which registration is sought; simplified provisions for recording the assignment of trade marks; and a more streamlined method for removing unused trade marks from the Trade Marks Register. These changes will benefit users of the trade marks system through the introduction of simpler procedures that eliminate unnecessary steps, improved efficiency in the Trade Marks Office and being in tune with the realities of modern marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this bill differs from the 1994 act, mostly in matters of clarity and technical detail, there are three changes that deserve special mention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, a number of submissions on the exposure draft of the 1994 bill addressed the government's proposals for streamlining the provisions relating to the `association' of trade marks. A business's trade marks are considered `associated' when they are substantially identical or deceptively similar and are used in relation to similar goods or services. The 1955 act requires that associated trade marks be identified as such and prohibits a bundle of associated trade marks from being split up and assigned to different people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After considering this issue further, the government has decided that it would be better to do away altogether with the concept of associated trade marks rather than retain the scheme set out in the Trade Marks Act 1994. This is in line with views expressed in submissions and is consistent with the situation in most other industrialised nations. Should a change of ownership of a trade mark result in deception or confusion, the validity of the registration of the trade mark may be challenged under other provisions of the bill which could result in the trade mark being deregistered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the bill does not include provisions relating to registration of the use of a trade mark by a person other than the trade mark owner. The bill provides that where owners of trade marks exercise control over use of their trade marks by other persons, that use can be taken to be use by the owner. This is prescribed by the WTO Agreement and can be used by trade mark owners to defend an action to deregister their trade mark on the basis that they have not used it. The WTO Agreement does not require use under the control of the owner of the trade mark to be registered. Consequently, there is little benefit in retaining additional provisions for the registration of users. This change will simplify the new trade marks legislation significantly. Recent developments in Canada and the UK are consistent with this approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the bill carries over the significantly increased penalties for counterfeiting and forging of trade marks introduced in 1992. Consistent with current criminal law policy, the bill also applies the fault element of knowledge or recklessness to these offences, rather than strict liability or the test of `ought reasonably to have known'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In keeping with modern legislative drafting practice, the bill sets out the guiding principles and general framework of the new trade marks system, with much of the detail devolved to the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new legislation will come into force on 1 January 1996. This will allow time for the significant administrative and other changes required as a result of the legislation to be made by users of the trade marks system and the Trade Marks Office, and enable interested parties to become more familiar with the legislation in its final form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the review of Australia's trade marks legislation that has resulted in the bill currently before the House, the government has been committed to extensive public consultation with a view to having in place the best possible registered trade marks system for Australian industry. We have placed great emphasis on getting the legislation right. Consequently, there have been extensive opportunities for public comment on the working party's reports and the exposure drafts of the bill and subordinate regulations and I believe that people have welcomed the opportunity to be able to contribute. Significantly, 35 public information seminars were held around Australia to explain the draft bill and its expected impact, and to receive direct feedback on the draft bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Receiving comments on the draft bill and regulations has been particularly helpful to the government in developing and refining the reforms to the trade marks system, as well as improving the specific structure and wording of the legislation itself. I would sincerely like to thank all those organisations and individuals who have contributed to this review, especially the Law Council of Australia, the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia, the Australian Manufacturers' Patents, Industrial Designs, Copyright &amp; Trade Mark Association (AMPICTA) and, in particular, the individuals concerned, for giving their time and for their devotion to the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implementation of this new trade marks legislation requires revision of existing practices and procedures in the Trade Marks Office, as well as major changes to the comparatively large and complex office computer system. The estimated cost to the Trade Marks Office, which is part of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation (AIPO), of the one-off implementation activity is estimated to be in the order of $4 million. This includes the modifications to the computer system and the training of Trade Marks Office staff with respect to the new practices and procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AIPO is required to recover all its costs from its fees and charges. AIPO operates on a group 2 trust account arrangement and is committed to containing costs for normal operations to within inflation and to achieving productivity gains at least equal to the efficiency dividend required for the Australian Public Service. The one-off costs of implementing the new trade marks system are budgeted for the next two years. Offsetting the one-off implementation costs will be benefits to the owners and users of trade marks in having a modern trade mark registration system that conforms with Australia's international commitments and is harmonised, as far as practicable, with similar systems of other OECD countries. In the longer term, there will be savings to the Trade Marks Office in the administration of a more streamlined system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been nearly 40 years since the current trade marks legislation came into force; I believe that the bill now before the House is a worthy successor and one that will serve and protect the interests of trade mark owners and the public well into the 21st century. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr Lawrence</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Areas are targeted on the basis of the aged care program's needs based planning model. The planning model has two major components.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is the planning benchmark ratio is currently set at 100 per 1000 people aged 70 and over (broken down as 40 nursing home places: 50 hostel places: 10 care package places per 1000 people aged 70 and over) and which will be progressively achieved over time. The ratios aim to achieve an equitable distribution of aged care places within each State and Territory and equitable access to services by older Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second component is consideration of the needs of planning regions by Aged Care Advisory Committees on the basis of quantitative and qualitative local data. These committees are comprised of 8-10 members of which only two are departmental officers. The remaining independent members are appointed by me on the basis of their individual knowledge, experience and ability to contribute to the planning of aged care and not as representatives of particular organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aged Care Advisory Committees consider matters such as existing service provision and client profiles, for example, the numbers of clients in residential services, long stay hospital patients and those receiving HACC services, service utilisation and regional demographics (such as ethnic mix and financial status of the population).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aged Care Advisory Committees provide recommendations to me about the distribution of places to planning regions. The targeted planning regions are then advertised in local and national newspapers in order to attract applications for funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Waverley, Manly, Baulkham Hills, Hornsby, Ku-ring-gai, North Sydney, Warringah and Pittwater areas of NSW were determined to be target areas in the 1995-96 round of funding applications primarily on the basis of comparative need for services in relation to other areas of NSW as demonstrated by current provision ratios.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Aged Care Advisory Committee considered local matters such as interest in establishing services, the likelihood of establishing services quickly, the existence of Approvals-in-Principle for the establishment of services, areas previously advertised in recent funding rounds and the facilities available in neighbouring States for those areas close to State borders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this basis, target areas were recommended as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Waverley&mdash;Applications have been sought for the provision of hostel places for this SLA on the basis of need for services (the current ratio for hostel places is 40.43 places per 1000 people aged over 70). There has been interest in the provision of hostel places in Waverley and feedback from the community and the local Aged Care Assessment Team supported the provision of additional hostel beds in this area. In addition, the adjoining areas of Randwick and Woollahra have very high need for services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Manly&mdash;Applications for the provision of hostel places have been sought for this SLA on the basis of need for services (the current hostel ratio is 13.86 places per 1000 people aged 70 and over). In addition, there is strong interest in and commitment to providing hostel places in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) Baulkham Hills&mdash;Applications for the provision of hostel places have been sought for this SLA on the basis of need for services (the current hostel ratio is 32.17 places per 1000 people aged 70 and over). In addition, there is strong interest in and commitment to providing hostel places in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) and (e) Hornsby/Ku-ring-gai&mdash;The Hornsby/Ku-ring-gai area has been targeted for the provision of care package services. While the area is well serviced in terms of hostel places (69:1000 people aged over 70), 768 places are located at the Anglican Retirement Villages complex. This facility has attracted substantial migration from other parts of Sydney which has created pressures on community and other services in caring for the local frail aged. The needs are such that the provision of care package services was considered to be appropriate by the Aged Care Advisory Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f) North Sydney&mdash;Applications for the provision of care package services have been sought for this planning area on the basis of need (there are currently no care packages available in this area). The adjoining SLAs of Lane Cove and Willoughby also have needs for services. As it is very difficult to instigate hostel projects in these areas, due to a shortage of available land, North Sydney has been recommended as a targeted are for the provision of care packages. In addition, strong interest in providing care packages has been demonstrated in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(g) and (h) Warringah/Pittwater&mdash;Applications for the provision of care package services have been sought for this planning area on the basis of need (there are currently no care package services available in this area). This area draws aged veterans from all over NSW and, as such, services a wider population than the immediate local area. In addition, there is a need for appropriate aged care services for the Armenian, German, Italian and Chinese populations that reside in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no interest in developing hostel services due to the unavailability of suitable land. However, there is demonstrated interest in the provision of care package services.</PARA>
