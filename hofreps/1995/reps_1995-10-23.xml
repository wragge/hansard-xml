<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, as the chairman of the subcommittee, would like at the outset to thank Mr Russell Hearne, who was seconded from the audit office as an adviser to the committee for the duration of the inquiry, and the committee secretary, Pattie Tancred, for their assistance. I also thank the other members of the subcommittee&mdash;the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and the member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report tabled today, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Keeping the customer satisfied</EMPHASIS>, continues the interest of the committee in issues of public administration and, particularly, the continuing reform of the Commonwealth's financial management. In 1990, the committee tabled a comprehensive review of the financial management improvement program, the banner under which many financial reforms were introduced. Last year the committee reported on the efficiency dividend, a controversial aspect of current funding of running costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, it is obvious that the aim of a better Public Service&mdash;that is, a more efficient and effective one&mdash;is very much in the public interest. We are all familiar with the famous example of the hospital with no patients from the TV series <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS>. The hospital actually ran very efficiently but without serving the needs of the patients for whom it existed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the reforms of recent years in mind, the committee inquired into the devolution of running costs flexibilities within agencies. As the name suggests, running costs are the costs of running government, the costs of delivering programs to the targeted clients of government. In the main, they consist of the salaries and administrative costs incurred by Public Service departments and related budget-funded entities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total cost to the Australian community of departmental running costs is expected to come in at $7.37 billion in 1994-95. This represents 7.6 per cent of total government outlays, or 8.5 per cent of total government revenue. In our view, it is important that the management of these resources not only be efficient but also contribute to the effectiveness of program delivery for the benefit of clients and the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the running costs arrangements, agencies can manage their budgets in a way not unlike commercial entities. In loosening control over internal budgetary management in budget-funded agencies, it was intended that responsibility for exercising real control over budget flexibility should be exercised at the lowest practical level in the management pyramid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before summarising the findings of the committee in this inquiry, it is important that I define devolution in the context of the Australian Public Service. Devolution is classically defined as the downward transfer of authority to make decisions to the most practical level of management. It is the `who decides' of management. By improved responsiveness to the local environment, devolution holds the promise of better value for money and improved client service. In this respect, the classical definition of devolution is, however, incomplete. To us, devolution includes not only the concept of who is best placed to make a decision but also who manages the budget to fund the decision and, more significantly again, who is able to take action for the benefit of clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the title of the report&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Keeping the customer satisfied</EMPHASIS>&mdash;suggests, client service has been the central theme of the inquiry. We believe that is quite correct. It is clear that devolution goes to the heart of what the community loves to hate in the public sector when they deal with, for example, the local DSS, CES or branch of the tax office. That is, can the manager at the local level change anything for me, or make any real decision to help, or is he or she merely a conduit for a remote state or central office, bound by procedure, sympathetic but impotent. The recent ANAO report into the Department of Social Security also focused on inefficiency, and particularly commented that it resulted in poor standards of customer service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee concluded that, on the whole, the current extent to which running costs management has been devolved was disappointing and left room for considerable improvement. Throughout the APS, devolution could be described as uneven. While we acknowledge that devolution has had its spectacular failures, which partly arose from overoptimistic expectations, we conclude that devolution should be applied more widely where the risks and costs are less than the benefits in improved service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee made two major findings during the course of its inquiry. The first is that improved public sector management through devolution needs an incentive in order for it to be widely introduced. Such an incentive should stimulate greater efficiency and effectiveness, and improved client service. Where there is no incentive, agencies will not take the risk of changing the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee observed that the most effective incentive for the spread of a devolved management was the introduction of contestability into the management environment. Contestability is most often associated with the introduction of commercialisation into the public sector under the auspices of privatisation, corporatisation or any other type of way that user pays funding arrangements can be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Obviously, commercialisation is inappropriate for large sections of the budget funded sector. Nevertheless, we believe that there is scope for the increased applicability of the principle of contestability within the budget sector. An example of this principle which impressed the committee was the notion of a corporate levy. This levy acts as an internal efficiency dividend and is creamed off the top of running costs budgets. Internal units of the organisation are then invited to bid for the accumulated funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A related concept to contestability is output based funding. Currently, agencies are funded on the likely costs of inputs such as salaries and administrative expenses. Guaranteed input funding may not encourage efficiency and greater client focus, as the financial viability of the agency is not at risk if it fails to deliver the services demanded of it. In the committee's view, there is scope for further study on the subject of funding models which strengthen the connection between agency funding and outputs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second major finding of the committee is that devolution involves a cultural change in the agency concerned. The hospital with no patients that I referred to earlier exemplifies what many in the community and, indeed, in this parliament may see as the Public Service attitude&mdash;where the means actually become the end and little attempt is made to identify and serve the clients of government programs who, after all, are the taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry found that devolution usually precipitates a change in the culture of agencies, and this change is related to the major incentive for the introduction of devolution. In a contestable environment, particularly where market pressures have been introduced, cultural change aids efficiency and a focus on clients. In budget-funded, non-commercial agencies, cultural change and devolution are spurred on by APS initiatives such benchmarking, continuous improvement, workplace bargaining, the efficiency incentives of the running costs arrangements, the efficiency dividend and cash limited budgets. The committee saw this cultural change as positive where the interests of more efficient management and greater client service were served and where attention was paid to the high standards of probity and accountability with which the APS has become synonymous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making recommendations for change, the committee was mindful of the continuing need for ongoing reform in the Australian Public Service and notes that various initiatives are under way to improve service delivery and to promote value for money within agencies. We believe these initiatives need to be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the influence of information technology and the global economy, the fundamental processes and role of government will be reassessed. The salient question for those in the public sector will be: where do we add value; and what do public sectors need to do well in order for their citizens to compete in a global economy? As the committee stressed throughout its report tabled today, enhanced client service should be the goal of devolved management. The committee believes that, in pursuit of this goal, new directions in public sector management are worthy of further deliberation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel obliged at the outset to remind the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) that the hospital with no patients was part of a fictitious TV show. It did not actually happen. It was not found in the deliberations of our committee. Nonetheless the technical nature of this report on the devolution of running costs flexibilities should not blind the parliament to the importance of the committee's findings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an important report for two reasons. The first is that it provides a very useful update on how extensively and successfully devolution has been pursued in the Australian Public Service. The second reason is that it provides a useful commentary on the challenges facing the public sector in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, like other members on this side of the parliament, want the public sector to succeed and we want it to continue to play a liberating and equalising role in our society. But the public sector can only succeed in the 1990s with public support, public good will and ultimately the funding support of the public through the taxation system. It therefore follows that our aspirations for more active and interventionist government in the 1990s rely on more effective government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the central management challenge for all parts of the public sector. It is a challenge that is made much more complex and acute by the way in which people these days are comparing public sector performance with private sector service. People are more likely to regard themselves as consumers than producers. Successful organisations, public and private, feature the adaptability needed to satisfy rapidly changing consumer demands. Flexibility and dexterity are essential, bringing together temporary alliances of personnel and know-how to address each market niche. Within this framework, the usefulness of a rigid approach to ownership and reliance on fixed production assets has basically expired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was demonstrated throughout the committee hearings by examination of large nationwide departments administering national laws&mdash;departments like tax, social security and DEET. They find it hard to be as responsive to their clients as smaller units, both in the public and the private sector. If we could conclude an adage out of this report for public administration, it would be that small is beautiful and flexibility is effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These large nationwide departments with their centralised culture are, according to our findings, much less inclined to devolve their running costs flexibilities. The task for public sector managers is to find the methods of motivation, devolution and improvement to give the public sector a growing place in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this respect, I think it is important to note that altruism, while commendable, is not enough. I was intrigued at one of the hearings to listen to Ms Hamilton from the Department of Human Services and Health about the motivations that her department applies for its staff and the task of devolution. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is desirable to conform with corporate culture. As a person working in a small organisational unit, you would know that the corporate culture says that making efficiency gains is a good thing, and that in making efficiency gains you are smiled upon by the hierarchy of the department and flourish in the department. That would be one of your main motivations.</PARA>
<PARA>I admire people with a positive altruistic attitude to their work but more is needed. I think it is self-evident that more is needed. We need the sorts of competitive influences and motivations ending in guaranteed income as much as possible. I join with the member for McPherson in expressing my interest and excitement about the way in which the Department of Finance, under this government's stewardship, is examining methods of output based payments for the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to maximise contestability. The committee found a whole range of benefits in the Attorney-General's Department and in the Department of Administrative Services where contestability has produced efficiency and enhanced devolution. We also need to decentralise government as much as possible. Smaller rather than larger units are going to be most responsive to customer needs in the current environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a very strong finding in this report that links the industrial relations environment in the Public Service to productivity gains: that is, to re-examine the effectiveness of the efficiency dividend and to replace agency bargaining with genuine enterprise or workplace bargaining as a method of enhanced public sector efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another key finding is the use of new information technology to break down fixed overhead costs in these large departments. I am pleased to report to the House that, in our assessment, Social Security and DEET are two departments which are using information technology outlets, flexible and service based, to enhance their responsiveness. The use of computer terminals in shopping centres and community halls as an outlet for departmental information is a very effective means by which overhead costs can be broken down and the public sector can be more responsive to its clients. This in part reflects the reinventing government agenda. It makes a commonsense point about the need to minimise the fixed assets of government and maximise flexible new sources of government intervention. This is a sensible response to the sorts of dynamic, economic and social changes that our community and our nation face in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the member for McPherson for his chairmanship of the subcommittee and the member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham), who was a very useful contributor. Most of all, I thank the secretariat, in particular Russell Hearne&mdash;who is in the chamber today&mdash;for his contribution. He provided tremendous guidance to the committee in the production of this useful report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I present the committee's report, including a dissenting report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Officer education: The military after next</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliament is well served by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which I have recently been pleased to serve as chairman. In particular, the defence subcommittee comprises individual members across the political spectrum, members with a genuine interest in the defence of the nation. It also comprises two former portfolio ministers and those who have served in the ADF. This report that I am tabling today reflects their good work and consideration. Judged by the number of recommendations, the report is modest and unflattering. However, the report represents a fundamental shake-up of officer education. Progress in the future will be benchmarked against this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the outset, I wish to place on the public record the fact that the ADF merits commendation for its commitment to officer professional education and development. It is second to none. The high quality of the officer corps is a product of individuals who are in it and the commitment to professional development, education and military training. The ADF has for some years sought to engage our regional neighbours. Part of the strategy has been to send ADF officers overseas to defence colleges and, in turn, accept overseas officers in the Australian Defence Force colleges. This policy serves Australia well. This report does not review specific war fighting skills, although I would expect this report to have an effect on the provision of such training. In the main, it does not cover modern media and methodology for delivering officer education, nor the provision of short and sandwich courses. But clearly the ADF could and should move in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was not critical of any of the nine establishments reviewed as part of its terms of reference, nor critical of the outcomes. The ADF is rightly proud of its traditions. The committee was concerned to review performance in relation to how it would cater for the military after next. This is predicated on the assumption that the next military will be only slightly better; and one seeks to leapfrog with incremental improvements. As I have said, the ADF is rightly proud of its traditions but should not be frightened of creating new ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee envisages that there will be greater reliance and flexibility in the use of reserves and mobility between reserves, part-time officers and regular full-time officers. Indeed, an officer's career may involve periods of full-time/part-time activity and periods of absence in the civilian work force. It is not to be expected that the ADF will always be able to nurture the expertise of some specialities in-house. Occasionally officers will wish to temporarily opt out, for family reasons. Until the problems of civilian employment are overcome, it will not be possible to fully train up reserves, as envisaged in the total force concept, and this will inhibit training of reserves allowed for in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opening of the Australian Defence Force Academy in 1986 followed a long period of investigation and consultation. The decision was made in the post-Vietnam environment and generated some controversy. It was based on two important considerations. It guaranteed the ADF a supply of university graduates into the officer ranks, and it pioneered jointery at the earliest stages of an officer's career. However, ADFA isolates undergraduates from their peer cohort in 37 other universities and therefore precludes the development of an understanding of different views, attitudes and beliefs held by other university students. In an ADF increasingly dependent on the community, informal community networks and links are stillborn at ADFA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically, notwithstanding the intense selection procedures, ADFA does not enjoy a superior graduation rate than other Australian universities. The cost to the ADF is half the $200 million spent on education and professional development of officers. The cost to the ADF for each graduating officer from ADFA is $308,712. It is hard to justify this cost based on the defence criterion of acceptable premiums and value for money. This is at a time when there has been significant underemployment for undergraduates, even for engineers who are often cited by defence as having more attractive options in civilian employment. Ordinary Australians will not understand the enormous cost per graduate of over $300,000 and will seriously doubt that this cost represents best value for increasingly scarce defence dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for these reasons that on balance the committee believes the undergraduate component of ADFA should be phased out. It should be replaced with a university scholarship scheme. The scheme, recommended to commence in 1997, is about selecting 1,000 students prior to their commencing university studies and being allowed to study at the university of their choice. Again, prior to commencing they would be required to undertake a basic military skills course during their undergraduate studies. They would be required to undertake further military training during part of the semester breaks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Table 15.5 shows one of the options considered by the committee: the estimated cost of the scheme, a saving of some $60 million allowing for a 20 per cent loading for allowances recommended by the committee. Indeed, some care would need to be taken regarding the amounts suggested by the committee for the scholarship as they are likely to distort the market and further work will be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new scheme is radically different from the military nunnery approach of ADFA. The decision to join the ADF as an officer is after graduation and would be a more mature and better informed decision than those currently being forced to be made at high school. It also provides for those candidates who do not make the final selection after graduation to be offered places in the reserves as officers or places as other ranks&mdash;either regulars or reserves. However, the ADF would be under no obligation to offer a position to any scholarship holder who did not make selection into the regular officer corps. The ADF would have the opportunity to increase the number of university graduates entering all ranks of the ADF, regular and reserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended that a feasibility study be conducted into the establishment of a triservice precommissioning college of no more than 12 months duration. Such a course would have common military subjects as well as single service elements. In my view all officer candidates&mdash;both regular and reserve&mdash;should be trained at the college. The triservice precommissioning college would provide jointery for everyone at the earliest stage of their career and would not just be for an elite within the officer corps, as ADFA currently provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There appears to be considerable variation in the approach to junior staff colleges by the single services. I confess to still being a little unclear. Junior staff occurs at a time when junior officers are undergoing their critical military skills training. The committee recommended that there be a review of both junior staff colleges and their military skills training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that there be a single triservice command and staff college with common military training and single service elements. This introduces jointery at an early stage of a senior officer's military career at the major equivalent level and, in some cases, senior captain level, depending on their role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee proposes that ADFA become a centre of excellence and incorporate its existing postgraduate component ACDSS, JSSC and the triservice command and staff. The committee recommends that ADFA establish both academic and military awards for excellence. In my view, the ADFA should be able to attract leading military and academics to join the teaching staff from Australia and overseas. Given the changed role proposed for ADFA, its governance would need to change and a new military and academic board would need to be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I express my thanks to Mr Ted Grace, the member for Fowler and incoming chairman of the subcommittee; in particular, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Ian Sinclair), the deputy chairman; Gillian Gould, the secretary who lives, eats and breathes defence; Wing Commander Ken Given; Matthew Mason-Cox, whom again I have been pleased to work with and who has contributed to another significant report; Peter McLay, who survives every change of secretary; and other secretarial staff who worked on this report, including Joanne Towner, the secretary of the main committee. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not an easy report to finalise. As I will mention briefly in a moment, I do not agree with everything in it. Nevertheless, I have to say to the House that I am disappointed once again that we find a minority report from Senator Margetts. Senator Margetts's credibility is suffering. For many of us, she is no longer a Greens senator. She seems to be the senator for dissenting reports. That does her credibility no good. I do not think it assists this committee in getting on with its business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will add my comments about the professionalism of the Australian Defence Force, which the honourable member for Chifley mentioned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report of the annual report of the Australian Securities Commission and other bodies for 1993-1994</EMPHASIS>, together with the evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee has examined the annual report for 1993-94 for each of the bodies established by the Australian Securities Commission Act. The committee also held public hearings with the Australian Securities Commission, on 6 February and 16 August 1995, on the ASC's role generally and sought further information on matters contained in the ASC's annual report.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several matters arising from the ASC's annual report and the public hearings to which I draw the attention of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first relates to the content of the ASC's annual report. In its June 1994 report to the parliament on the ASC's 1992-93 annual report, the committee indicated that future reports of the ASC should contain more analysis and interpretation of long-term developments affecting the ASC and the administration and enforcement of the Corporations Law. The committee notes that this ASC annual report provides more information about the role and activities of the ASC than in previous years. The committee trusts that the provision of such information will continue in future years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recurring issue in committee discussions with the ASC has been its ability to recruit and retain specialist staff in a highly competitive market. At present, it appears that the turnover rate of ASC staff is not out of line with that in the Public Service generally. Although it remains difficult for the ASC to attract and retain people with specialist skills, the ASC has not expressed any concerns that its effectiveness is being significantly impeded by staffing difficulties. The committee will monitor this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possibility or perception of conflicts of interest occurring for ASC members or its officers was the subject of media comment during the year under review. The committee notes, for example, that Mr Joe Longo, a Western Australian legal practitioner who had previously acted for Mr Alan Bond, was recruited by the Western Australian regional office of the ASC. The Western Australian regional commissioner made it clear at the time of Mr Longo's appointment that Mr Longo would not be involved in any matters relating to investigations of the Bond companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee questioned the ASC on the position of Ms Lyn Ralph in her role as both Deputy Chairman of the ASC and a director of the NRMA. The Chairman of the ASC assured the committee that Ms Ralph had not been involved in consideration of matters where a conflict of interest may have arisen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee discussed with the ASC chairman the possibility of conflict of interest arising when senior officers of the ASC are recruited from or returned to the private sector. The nature of the ASC's activities requires that it recruits the most experienced personnel available. This will often mean recruiting experienced personnel from the private sector and facilitating their return to the private sector at the end of their appointment. The committee endorses this practice. However, the committee recognises that it will inevitably give rise to some possible conflicts of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee questioned the ASC on the arrangements the previous chairman of the ASC, Mr Tony Hartnell, had entered into with his law firm on his appointment as chairman. The ASC chairman, Mr Cameron, assured the committee that the previous chairman had not been involved in consideration of matters where a conflict of interest may have arisen. The committee remains uncomfortable that Mr Hartnell's arrangements with his law firm were not disclosed at the time of his appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is of the view that it would be appropriate that any such arrangements be disclosed. It considers that, although there may have been no adverse impact on the operations of the ASC, the failure to disclose these arrangements may have had the potential to affect public confidence in the ASC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the committee recommends that when commissioners or senior staff of the ASC are recruited from private enterprise they be required to make a full, confidential disclosure of any arrangements with previous or future employers. The committee also recommends that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) give consideration to applying the same requirement to other relevant government agencies and departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the committee's February hearing with the ASC, the committee discussed at some length the ASC's examination of the prospectus associated with the proposed public float of the NRMA. Committee members were concerned about the apparent inaction of the ASC when the NRMA prospectus, which was found to be misleading by the Federal Court, was distributed to 1.8 million NRMA members. The committee raised the NRMA matter with the ASC both as a matter of current concern and as an example of how prospectuses are dealt with by the ASC in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASC response to the committee's questioning is reported in the committee's report, and I draw part of it to the attention of honourable members, namely:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The court took a different view. We have to learn the lesson of that particular case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, while the Commission obviously should not be satisfied with its performance&mdash;in terms that it has allowed the document to be registered and did not challenge it, yet a court has subsequently found that it was misleading and deceptive&mdash;the fact is that the court made that decision after the opposing case had been presented by Queens Counsel for some days . . . We get the prospectus lodged for registration; a statutory requirement to register it within 14 days; and, in effect, we do not get the opposing case.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee expects that the ASC will consider any future case which is similar to the NRMA proposal bearing in mind the decision of the Federal Court on the NRMA prospectus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its June 1994 report, the committee commented on the abuse of the corporate form in the textile industry. The committee had received representations that businesses had been structured so that the employees of the business were employed by a company with limited assets while assets of the business were held by a separate company. If these businesses cease, the company employing group employees have no assets with which to pay accumulated holiday pay, long service leave or redundancy payments and are placed in liquidation. Principals of the business retain control of its assets in a separate company where they are not accessible to employees or creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representations were made to the committee that a New South Wales group of companies, the Gazal group, had structured its businesses in this way and that companies in the Gazal group have failed to pay holiday, long service leave and redundancy payments to employees. The committee indicated in its June 1994 report that it would continue to observe developments on this issue and on the scope and effectiveness of ASC activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1995 the ASC announced that it would target `strings of companies' or `phoenix' company chains in a community response project. The ASC said that it would particularly focus on directors who have a history of moving from company to company, leaving a string of debts behind them. In August 1995 the Attorney-General announced that the Corporations Law Simplification Task Force would examine this issue as part of stage 3 of the simplification program. It will look at how to tighten up the rules on the disqualification of people who abandon companies with unpaid debts and without winding them up. The Law Reform Committee of the Parliament of Victoria has also examined this issue. The committee is encouraged by the interest being taken in this important issue and welcomes the developments in overcoming it since the committee's last report. The committee will continue to monitor developments on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matters dealt with in the committee's report are the program of ASC investigations, the Australian Stock Exchange continuous disclosure regime, the corporate law simplification program, ASC class orders, relations between the ASC and the Commonwealth DPP and the consistency of ASC administrative practices and decisions between various state offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As required by the Australian Securities Commission Act, the committee will continue to carefully scrutinise the activities, roles and functions of the ASC and other bodies set up to ensure Australian corporations and securities laws are effective and up to date, and that reports under the ASC Act are informative and of maximum benefit to the parliament and the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, I wish to note one particular aspect of concern to me, and that is the question of class orders and the way in which class orders are granted by the Australian Securities Commission. I am going from my recollection of the evidence given, but my concern basically is this: the Corporations Law, together with Accounting Standard 1017, require that third-party related transactions must be disclosed. This matter has been a topic of some conversation and some reportage in the last little while. But it is possible to get a class order under the Corporations Law which relieves the directors of the corporation and the auditors from reporting on related third-party transactions. The mechanism for doing that is to apply to the Australian Securities Commission for such an order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, my concern was particularly raised because the Bankers Association had requested an extension to the class order because an amendment had been made to tighten up the reporting requirements. The Bankers Association had written a letter on behalf of the banks, but the text of that letter was very specific to the Commonwealth Bank and its reporting time. The request was that the class order should be made expeditiously. In fact, the class order was made expeditiously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we held a public hearing, I asked representatives of the Australian Securities Commission who attended just how that class order was dealt with, who signed it and what rigour it was put through to see whether or not it ought to have been granted. When I asked those representatives from the Australian Securities Commission whether they realised that, once that class order had been granted, the relationship between the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his piggery group of companies and the Commonwealth Bank did not need to be reported on they replied that they did not know that that would be the effect of the order. I then asked whether it would have made a difference to their giving that order, and they replied that they certainly would have been more hesitant and would have given it far more consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My specific concern relates to the effect that the class order had in preventing information as to Mr Keating's dealings with the Commonwealth Bank, bearing in mind the relationship between the government and the Commonwealth Bank, and particularly the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Commonwealth Bank, and the need to have transparency. The broader principle also applies, and that is the degree of scrutiny that is given generally to such an application. In the report we say that we will continue to monitor this situation, and it was an important issue to raise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general work that the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities does is of a good and investigative nature. The matters that come before us are ones of substance. The close relationship that has to exist between the committee and its scrutiny of the Australian Securities Commission is an important relationship. In speaking to the report, I commend the work that is done by the committee, but it was that particular matter relating to class orders that I wished to highlight. </PARA>

<PARA>The United Nations was established 50 years ago tomorrow, and tomorrow a great gathering of heads of government and heads of state will be held in New York to celebrate that very important event. I am very glad that this House is debating this celebration because it gives us an opportunity to praise the United Nations, to be analytical about areas which have not been of as high a standard as they might have been and to talk a little about the challenges and opportunities that are facing the United Nations in the coming years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations has been a remarkable organisation and Australia has played an important part in its foundation. We were present at the San Francisco conference towards the end of the Second World War at which the foundation of the United Nations was negotiated. Australia has continued to play a very important role in the functioning of the United Nations. We have been amongst its main supporters. We have continued to lead debates. We have been very prompt and effective supporters financially of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations has had remarkable achievements during the last 50 years. The organisation has contributed to a whole series of global problems in effective ways. It has contributed most obviously to the reduction of strategic conflict. Through peacekeeping, mediation and negotiation it has contributed to the most important area of conflict resolution and conflict reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one would argue that the United Nations has been as successful as we would like. That is patently clear to everyone. But it is also clear that many former areas of conflict are not now areas of conflict because of the effectiveness of United Nations organisation officials and the work that they have performed. The United Nations has contributed, often in very effective ways, to economic and social development in developing countries. The United Nations has led the global debate concerning the crucially important area of the reduction of poverty. The United Nations development program, UNICEF&mdash;the United Nations Children's Fund&mdash;and many other parts of the organisation are involved in that crucial activity and have contributed effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations has been important in enhancing human rights, in reducing environmental destruction, in reducing pollution and in providing the global infrastructure framework for telecommunications, postal services, health services and for a whole series of crucial services that have to be provided, at least in part, internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that there have been inefficiencies. Too many people who are not the best that their country has to offer have been appointed. Far too commonly countries have not kept up to date with their financing and have then blamed the United Nations for inadequacies which are really the direct result of underfunding and members being in arrears. We are all aware that the United States and Russia are the two principal countries which are seriously in arrears at present. They are therefore undermining the effectiveness of the work of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that the United Nations recognises the challenges which it is going to face in the future. Those challenges are being multiplied by the fact that we now live in an increasingly globalised world, one in which the role of the United Nations must be increased and intensified. Many of the global problems of pollution, the spread of disease, drug trafficking, conflict resolution and economic and social development have an international dimension which can only be effectively handled cooperatively, internationally and through the United Nations organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means that funding must also be maintained and increased. It is essential that the countries that are in arrears pay their statutory obligations quickly but that, as well as that, new and additional sources of funding be found so that those international requirements are effectively fulfilled. Many proposals are now around for this. There is the possibility of a small levy on international travel and a small levy on international financial transactions, which would also, by the way, contribute to reducing international financial instability. These mechanisms are potentially available and are receiving increased attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be supporting the study of those proposals so that they can be effectively investigated and, if agreement is reached, introduced.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we should acknowledge the positive contribution of the UN to the international community over the last 50 years in terms of its specialist social and economic agencies and human rights monitoring mechanisms, it would be the view of many that it has become too large, that it is underfinanced and that it is in deep crisis and is therefore justifiably under serious fire from many quarters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">US ambassador in New York, Madeleine Albright, put it bluntly when she said recently `Reform or die'. Richard Woolcott, Australia's former long-serving UN senior diplomat, also said last weekend:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the UN is an assembly of sovereign states. It lacks executive authority. It is not unlike a parliament or club in that it is only as good as its members.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . its problems have been compounded by a worsening financial crisis . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas, went further in New York a couple of weeks ago when he referred to the UN being on the `very brink of insolvency'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the UN's strongest champions acknowledge serious design flaws. More than ever, the UN secretariat appears to a bureaucratic, paper-producing machine with a built-in political patronage system; the General Assembly is an unwieldy talk-fest or debating society; the Security Council is outdated in its post Cold War membership and methodology; the mishmash of specialist agencies spread around the globe are fast developing into a swamp into which good intentions can sink with barely a trace; and, above all, the paramount duty of keeping the peace is in disrepute&mdash;some might say disgrace, if the Bosnian experience is to be taken as a benchmark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These criticisms aside, there is evidence that but for the UN and its activities the world today would have not made the progress that it has, particularly in the less developed countries. Major achievements include that it has provided the means by which many former colonies have attained independence peacefully, and it has rallied opposition internationally to racism and apartheid. The specialised agencies, such as UNICEF and the world food program, have brought comfort, indeed life, to many thousands of malnourished and dehydrated children and to refugees. The World Health Organisation has improved health in many parts of the world, and it played a major role in the eradication of smallpox. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN has become the key forum for negotiating international agreements on civil aviation, communications and the management of resources on a global basis. It has become the logical arena in which to tackle issues that require a cooperative global approach, such as the environment, drugs, terrorism, refugees, AIDS, population and development. Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali reiterated these achievements in a recent interview in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the United Nations has been a success in Cambodia. We have put an end to a war in Mozambique. We have put an end to a civil war in El Salvador. We have been able to obtain the codification of the law of the sea; we have been able to extend the life of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. People have become more aware of the problem of environment. The United Nations has done a lot.</PARA>
<PARA>The UN's charter and the associated principles are sound but grew out of the ashes of World War II. As Richard Woolcott has observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the world needs a stronger and more effective United Nations, but on the eve of its 50th birthday the organisation is in crisis. Its credibility has been damaged by perceived failures in Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia. The high hopes generated at its birth on October 24, 1945, that global selective security would be the guiding principle of international life, have faded.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If 50 years later, the UN is to start to recover its prestige and improve its effectiveness, then it must move beyond the rhetoric of the commemoration. World leaders must also set sign posts for the future that will lead to overall change and genuine reform . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The  UN  is  too  important  to  be  allowed  to wither . . .</PARA>
<PARA>On this side of the House, we see those reforms involving the possible increase in United Nations Security Council membership, adding Japan and Germany, together with strong support, and I hope bipartisan support, for Australia's bid for membership in 1997-98. Secondly, the secretariat and specialised agencies need to end duplication and move towards more independence in staff recruiting with a move away from national secondments and perceptions of the pork-barrel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there is a need for clearer distinction between peacekeeping and peace enforcement mandates, with future mandates having more expressed objectives, adequate resources and a limited scope and duration. Consideration needs to be given to rapid reaction capability, particularly a permanent operational headquarters responsible for contingency planning. Finally, funding shortfalls should not be financed by global taxes as suggested by the foreign minister recently. He should be embarrassed by recent disclosures that his own department argued strongly against these as totally impractical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding difficulties need to be overcome by member states themselves meeting budgeting allocations. For example, for the years 1989 to 1994, the assessment levels for the United States' share and each of the other UN members' shares show that the United States and 15 other nations contribute or pay between 82 and 85 per cent of the UN budget. Only four countries, including the United States, as the honourable member for Fraser has said, consistently failed over the six-year period to pay the entire assessment annually and maintained unpaid or outstanding contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial calamity beckons even now. A total of $US3.3 billion in unpaid assessments is owed by all countries but one&mdash;and I suspect that country might be Australia&mdash;with the US as the biggest debtor. Washington's arrears amount to $US1.4 billion, or nearly a third of the UN's combined budgets of $US4.5 billion. It might surprise a lot of people that in August the UN was arguably insolvent. It was unable to pay its bills but for some initiatives that were passed by a meeting of the General Assembly. Former British ambassador to the United Nations Sir Anthony Parsons has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the UN will become irrelevant if it won't reform itself.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the point that the honourable member for Fraser made. Sir Anthony went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Don't let's waste too much time and energy of clever men.</PARA>
<PARA>I support that view. We on this side of House certainly hope that over the next couple of days the leaders' meeting in New York will agree in a resolution to reaffirm the very real aims and objectives that were established in San Francisco on 24 October 1945. Therefore, for my part, this side has much pleasure in commending the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pleasure to speak about congratulating the United Nations on the celebration of their 50th anniversary. I know that much criticism can be made of the United Nations and, indeed, fairly. But this is the only and, therefore, the best United Nations we have. Where would we be without it? Rather than the United Nations becoming less relevant with the collapse of communism, it is my view that it is becoming more relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the United Nations is unfairly criticised from time to time. Bosnia is often cited as an example of the failure of the United Nations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been pleased as a member of this parliament to see United Nations' operations, particularly in peacekeeping, in Somalia and in Rwanda. As the United Nations contemplates its next 50 years, I am firmly of the view that there is going to be an increasing role for regional organisations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We live in an imperfect world, so I suppose we should not be surprised that when the nations of the world beget a world organisation it is far from perfect. Today we are commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. When one reads some of the articles marking the occasion, one wonders just what hope the United Nations has. Their titles talk of a midlife crisis and ask, `Is the UN beyond rescue?' But when we talk of the United Nations today, we should remember the ideals that inspired its founders 50 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The name `United Nations' was devised by Franklin D. Roosevelt, surely the greatest United States President this century has seen, in 1942, the darkest days of the war, to describe the 26 nations&mdash;including Australia&mdash;which pledged to continue the battle against fascism and Japan and `to defend life, liberty, independence and religious freedom and to preserve human rights and justice'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ideals that inspired the UN are the great ideals of Western civilisation. Indeed, one of the greatest problems with the UN is that its strongest supporters are its worst enemies. They expect it to do too much. The UN is often used as a scapegoat. It is treated as if it is an independent actor. However, the UN is only as good as its members. When we look at Bosnia, for example, we see that the members of the Security Council bear much of the responsibility for the years of bloodshed, not the UN itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This of course does not excuse the waste, duplication, corruption and pointlessness of much of the UN's bureaucracy. It does not excuse the failure of past attempts to streamline its organisation, nor the financial structures that mean out of its 185 members a country with the wealth of Saudi Arabia contributes only 0.2 per cent of its budget while the US is still supposedly responsible for a quarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the organisation can only be as strong and successful as its member states permit. Idiot ideas such as the suggestion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) for a world tax to finance the UN will not solve its problems. Instead, the UN needs to undergo reforms so it can meet the realities of a new world environment. Global problems&mdash;such as nuclear weapons, pariah states like North Korea and Iraq and environmental protection&mdash;need global solutions. Nation states simply cannot go it alone on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations was constrained by the Cold War and divided by two opposing blocks for most of its history. Over the past five years, however, it has been asked to act as a global emergency service, a role for which it has not been prepared. We must consider the UN's limits. It has been able to provide a worthwhile forum for the airing of grievance and disputes and has performed well over the years in its peacekeeping, policing and mediation roles. However, it has not been able to engage in nation building exercises, such as in Somalia, or in managing the civil wars, as it has tried to do in the former Yugoslavia. Attempting to overreach only discredits the organisation and distracts from its worthwhile work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upward shift in economic power and increasing internationalisation are creating new demands. Already, the ability to post a letter or make a phone call overseas depends on a web of UN agencies and agreements. Globalisation will create new demands for international treaties as, by necessity, government at the supernational level will be cooperative rather than autarkical and contractual rather than sovereign in nature. This is where much of the UN's future lies, and if we are to properly deal with this new international environment we must ensure our own federation has formal mechanisms for state consultation and an increased role for this parliament in ratifying such agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations must become more efficient. It needs to shed redundant and marginal agencies and must concentrate on its key roles. However, for all its faults, if we had no United Nations we would need to create one. We should remember the ideals that originally inspired the UN and the Australians who served it in its earlier days&mdash;Sir Percy Spender, Sir Paul Hasluck and Dr Evatt&mdash;and make sure it abides by them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the next few days, as the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the UN is commemorated, many words about the organisation will be spoken. These words will mainly focus on the perceived failings of the UN. But what is the real failure of the UN? The real failure is that the sovereign states who comprise its membership have never given the UN the power it needs to do its job effectively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN is used as a scapegoat for the inability, or more often the unwillingness, of many states to make tough decisions. The worst offender in this regard is the United States. The United States was happy to use the UN in the early days when the majority of members were supporters of the US and the US could get its way on almost every issue. This was especially true during the period that the Soviet Union boycotted the Security Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the growing decolonisation of Africa and Asia, more and more members took their place in the international organisation, which went from basically being an organisation of white colonial powers to an international body reflective of the diverse nature of the international community. When it could not get its way, the US spat the dummy. Just as the US had never joined the League of Nations, so it spat the dummy at the ILO and UNESCO and, although remaining a member of the UN, has been supercritical of the UN. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People talk about the UN as if `it' was an entity in its own right. But the UN is really a collection of sovereign states, and each jealously guards its sovereignty. So it denies the UN the ability to do its job effectively. It also seems to me somewhat ironic that those most critical of the UN and the system are those who are most in arrears in the payment of their dues to the UN. How can we expect it to effectively operate when it is owed something like $3.5 billion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While people always dwell on the perceived failure, little thought is given to the successes. How often have conflicts been averted by quiet diplomacy or preventive diplomacy? The major achievements of the UN are that it has provided the means by which many former colonies have attained independence peacefully and it has rallied opposition internationally to racism and apartheid. The specialised agencies, such as UNICEF and the world food program, have brought comfort&mdash;indeed, life&mdash;to many thousands of malnourished and dehydrated children and refugees. The World Health Organisation has improved health in many parts of the world and it played a major role in the eradication of smallpox. It has become the key forum for negotiating international agreements on civil aviation, communications and the management of resources on a global basis. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea is an obvious example of this. The UN has become the logical arena in which to tackle issues that require a cooperative global approach such as the environment, drugs, terrorism, refugees, AIDS and population and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like all organisations, there can be reform of the bureaucracy. It also seems to me that there should be reform of some of its bodies, such as the Security Council. How can Britain and France claim permanent status on the UN's Security Council while nations such as Germany, Japan, Nigeria, Indonesia, India and Brazil are denied this status? If the Security Council is going to be effective, we have to have a re-look at the five permanent members. It seems to me that the permanent membership of the Security Council should be increased and the veto power of these permanent members should be dispersed with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN is too important to be allowed to wither. Whatever its faults, it remains the best hope for the community of nations, especially the smaller and less developed nations, as the world strives for that elusive goal of a more secure and peaceful world as well as wider social justice and decent living standards.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)deplores the decision of the Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to discontinue the 5 nights per week State-based <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> and its replacement by a once-a-week late night substitute;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)views with concern the tendency to centralising of the electronic media; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)calls for the enhancement of regional and State-based programming in the national and commercial broadcasting systems.</PARA>
<PARA>The changing of the format of a television program would not of itself necessarily raise passions of libertarians. However, the controversial decision to axe the state based <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report </EMPHASIS>should. I raise this matter for three reasons: first, to air the overwhelming bipartisan opposition to the move; second, to highlight, as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) described it, that the end of such a program is the loss of one of the great political debating arenas for local stories; and, third, but more fundamentally, the action of the ABC board gives greater impetus to the centralising of opinion making in the electronic media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before examining a number of these issues in detail, let me make one thing perfectly clear. This is not an ABC bashing exercise. I am not ABC phobic; quite the contrary. It is my respect for this great institution and my belief that it is compromising its integrity with this move&mdash;that its board has either been manipulative or manipulated&mdash;that leads me to this criticism. Further, I have no hang-ups with appropriate nationally based electronic media programs. It is the balance of national, state and regional programming that I call for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we are seeing here a dangerous centralising of opinion making. When I say `manipulative' or `manipulated', let me go back over the last 15 months. At the beginning of that period, former ABC managing director David Hill announced that there would be a major change to ABC news and current affairs programming. The ABC board proposed three distinct programs: 6.30 state and regional news; 7 p.m. national news, and a 7.30 p.m. national current affairs program. As we know, there was a national outcry and the board backed down. State based news and current affairs were to stay, or at least we were led to believe so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now obvious that the board or management or both never really accepted the decision in good grace. The seeds of change had been planted and there was evidence that the cat was to be skinned in a different way. We have only to listen to the former head of TV news in Victoria, Mr Jock Rankin, in his submission to the Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State control of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> has disappeared along with a number of state based positions. Despite the board's decision the program has gone national in all but name.</PARA>
<PARA>His claim is backed up by former Victorian <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> presenter Mary Delahunty, who said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 29 September this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC has bled resources and staff from the state programs. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. You don't give the resources and support and leadership required to do the serious, independent, professional journalism.</PARA>
<PARA>So it came as no surprise that the ABC board this time agreed to wipe the already weakened and underresourced and poorly rating state based <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. It was at best a self-fulfilling prophecy; at worst a cynical manipulation of public perception. But, still worse, it flies in the face of the view of this parliament as conveyed by the Senate select committee as recently as March this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No changes to the existing structure of TV news or current affairs should be made without full consultation with staff, the obtaining of detailed research information and the comprehensive consideration by the board of all such relevant issues.</PARA>
<PARA>There has been no consultation. If the charge that the Stateline idea was dreamed up in the last three weeks before the board's decision is true, then there certainly has been no research and no comprehensive consideration. In reality, as one arts and media union official put it, `They'&mdash;the ABC&mdash;`are exchanging the state format to solve a ratings problem in Sydney and Melbourne.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is worse is the crass way the ABC dressed up its offsetting measures. After new managing director Brian Johns told us that he was quite aware of public and staff concerns about the centralising of ABC news and current affairs, he dished up four sugar-coated pills which I would like to examine briefly. Firstly, TV News is to be left untouched. I, Paul Neville, ask: for how long? If the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> follows the Hill/board plan, how long will it take for another $12 million of supposed saving to deal a death blow to the state based television news programs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is to be a new state based, once-a-week current affairs program Stateline&mdash;and, wait for it&mdash;at 10.30 on a Friday night. You have to be kidding to believe that this is anything else but a pathetic sop destined to fail or at best languish in super low ratings. It is doomed before it starts. What does the ABC think the average intelligent Queenslander or Western Australian does at 10.30 on a Friday night? And how about the ABC's wonderful variety and family entertainment show <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Roy and H.G.'s Club Buggery</EMPHASIS>, which currently holds that time slot? I ask you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, a new national weekly program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Correspondent</EMPHASIS> will be created&mdash;out of Brisbane, not Sydney. Again, I suspect, another sop to mollify the Queensland <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30</EMPHASIS> staff, who with Western Australia held the top ratings for the network. As a Sydney ABC staffer so exquisitely put it when they were given this new program, `They have thrown them a bone.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point is planning for three more news bureaus&mdash;one each in northern Australia, Western Australia and south-east Australia&mdash;doubtless to give the impression that the ABC is serious about its regional responsibilities. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper editorial on 29 September quite correctly asked, what is `the logic of expanding news gathering capacity while severely reducing the prospects of items going to air'? Quite simply and cleverly, Brian Johns has wrapped up the decision to axe the state based <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> programs like a sugar-coated pill. The reality, however, lies in the fact that New South Wales, with 34 per cent of the national population, has over 50 per cent of ABC staff and produces just under 50 per cent of all programs while, in comparison, Queensland has 17 per cent of the population, eight per cent of ABC staff and produces six per cent of ABC programs. The tendency to even greater centralisation is seen in the supposed staff allocations for the new national <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Sydney, 25; Melbourne, 13; Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, three; Hobart and Darwin, a mere one each. That says it all!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somewhere, some time, the Australian community must take a stand on the centralising of media control. The ABC, as the national free to air broadcaster, has a moral and leadership role to deliver. In this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> decision, it has abrogated that role. A quick scan of the Australian media landscape should put a decided chill through the veins of all lovers of freedom, cultural diversity and a well informed society, as bulwarks against oppression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over recent years we have seen capital city daily and weekly banners eliminated or merged. The bulk of the metropolitan print media is now controlled by three groups and two groups dominate regional print media. These features are bad enough, but at least there is a diversity of opinion and, in most instances, editorial independence. In radio, the widening of the spectrum, the FM phenomenon and narrow-casting have ostensibly created greater diversity. Sadly, when it comes to news and public opinion, the reverse is true. Larger and larger networks are being formed, with blocks of programming&mdash;sometimes in the morning, sometimes at midday, sometimes in the afternoon and almost certainly at night&mdash;coming out of that centralised network system. Some radio stations are little more than relay transmitters. In fact, one commercial station in my area transmits on-line programs from 9 a.m. to l p.m. There is no local programming whatsoever for the morning program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In TV, we were promised greater choice in provincial TV with aggregation. We were given three networks. Yet we are largely confined to the pre-aggregation player when it comes to news. The other two networks take their on-line news from their capital city affiliates. ABC regional television news bulletins are well and truly a thing of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, for a second, let us look at commercial and ABC news and current affairs. Everything is centralised in early morning programming.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)calls for the enhancement of regional and State-based programming in the national broadcasting systems.</PARA>
<PARA>The ABC has a great responsibility as a national broadcaster. To meet that national responsibility effectively, it needs to ensure that it takes account of local and regional sensitivities. I have expressed in this place before my view that the decision by the board to axe the state based <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> does not meet that local and regional sensitivity and therefore does not meet its overall obligation as a national broadcaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fundamental point needs to be made: it is all well and good for members from various states to stand up and make their local points, but one needs to take a close look at the various policy prescriptions that respective parties take to elections. I remind those opposite of what they were committed to at the last election. Page 247 of Fightback, under the heading `Communications', says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition parties will ensure that all Australians receive value for money in public spending on ABC and SBS through the achievement of greater efficiency and productivity in the provision of their services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC and SBS will be required to make expenditure savings of around 10 per cent of current outlays resulting in savings of about $56 million.</PARA>
<PARA>That came in at about $6 million for SBS and $50 million for the ABC. What does chopping $50 million out of the ABC do? It makes absolutely sure that the ABC has no capacity or facility for any local or regional production of news and current affairs programs. The policy which those opposite took to the last election had the effect of doing this writ large. So honourable members opposite need to be aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Hinkler also spoke about bipartisanship in this matter. I want to later read some of the comments of the shadow minister for communications to show that those opposite may need to do a little bit of pushing and shoving so far as their spokesperson is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a history to this matter. The honourable member for Hinkler referred to proposals which were floated in August 1994. I quote to the House comments made by Alan Carpenter, who is the anchor person of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> in Western Australia. He made these comments on the previous proposals, and they ring true today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ABC News in Western Australia is acknowledged as a major success. It regularly outrates all but one of the commercial news services in this state and is clearly the most successful 7 pm news bulletin produced by the ABC across Australia, averaging 20 ratings points.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 7.30 Report in Perth is likewise considered a successful programme with a consistent ratings average of 16 points a night . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both ABC News and 7.30 Report have widespread community respect and support in this state&mdash;support which we believe will be seriously jeopardised if the proposed changes go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>The decision made by the board last month does not pick up all of the proposals of the August 1994 suggestion. In effect, local news production is saved but local current affairs dies. It is proposed to be replaced by what is described in Mr Johns's media release as `State Lateline'&mdash;which I assume will become `Stateline'&mdash;to be locally produced and broadcast at 10.30 p.m. on Friday nights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has been made strongly by people from Western Australia that the ABC might just as well not bother. We are not mugs who think that a sop of local current affairs at 10.30 on a Friday night is worth doing at all. If the ABC board is serious about meeting its national responsibilities for local and regional sensitivities, then it needs to think again. It might just as well not bother with the 10.30 Friday night state based <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not a believer in conspiracy theories, but I understand that Wendy Silver, who is a member of the board and a resident of Western Australia, was not present at the board meeting when these decisions were made. If decisions of this nature were made when all of the board members, particularly those from outlying states, were present, hopefully these sorts of decisions would not be made. I quote the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) on the ABC on the morning of 28 September. Pru Goward, on Radio National, asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Okay now and finally in your old portfolio, telecommunications and the pay TV, I guess current affairs changes within ABC television debate. Do you agree with people like Stephen Smith from your own State that there are losses for viewers in the changes that have been announced?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kim Beazley: Oh that's in the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pru Goward: Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kim Beazley: Well, you'd want to watch it very carefully. The <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> in WA has a big impact. It is one of the great political debating arenas and great for local stories. I think in Western Australia the loss of the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> is going to be a bad thing for the State, the loss of a Western Australian-based <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, and the ABC's going to have to work very hard to make that up to Western Australians if they're going to sustain a deserved reputation as a great national broadcaster.</PARA>
<PARA>These things are picked up by the WA branch of the Australian Writers Guild, which wrote to me at the end of last month, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We support your concerns regarding the plan to discontinue the nightly State-based editions of the 7.30 Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coverage of issues of importance to West Australians will be diminished by this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the proposal is not reversed, we urge you to seek assurances that the new national program will be sensitive to the interests of the WA community, and that other alternatives will be explored to retain a local arena for discussion and debate.</PARA>
<PARA>That is certainly not 10.30 on a Friday night. There were similar expressions of concern from Ian Thompson, the Branch Secretary of the CPSU Public Sector Union group. Writing to Mr Johns, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to object to the cutting of the 7.30 Report in my State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 7.30 Report is one of the few places I can turn to get nightly coverage of local issues and find out about State politics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the ABC is `my ABC' it should cover issues in my State and of concern to me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 7.30 Report should be maintained and improved, or at least replaced by another show that gives us at least as much coverage of local politics and local issues.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, these sentiments were not reflected by the shadow minister for communications, Senator Alston, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> radio program on 28 September&mdash;the day after the board announced its decisions. There were a couple of sops in it for local and state based concerns, but I will give you the fundamental philosophical approach that the spokesperson for those opposite takes on these matters. Senator Alston said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well I think in relation to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> there was a need for a change and to go national and I think that's generally being welcomed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He obviously was not listening to the member for Hinkler. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do think that there is a need to have a national based <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> . . . I think given the way in which the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> has evolved over recent years, to me personally, it's lacked the clout that you need, I think there are major national issues that ought to get a run in my own home State of Victoria for example . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think there is a critical need to have a national focus on current affairs at prime time. So the issue really is how far the ABC should and can go in relation to having at least prime time regional coverage.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a sop for the regions and outlying states which, to be fair to Senator Alston, is reflected in comments such as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think there has to be continuing concerns about localism . . .</PARA>
<PARA>and:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if for example, you're only going to have one program per week at 10.30 at night on a Friday, then that may not be a time slot that would meet the  needs  of  ensuring  that  you  cover  the country . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is an understatement. Those opposite might want to put these matters to the shadow spokesman for communications so that the full weight of the views of members of this place go to the ABC board to ensure that, if its decision in respect of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> is not reversed, it makes an absolute commitment to ensuring that local and regional current affairs are dealt with adequately and properly and that it does not offer a sop that only a mug would accept, the sop of a state based program at 10.30 on a Friday night. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) in his motion today. I congratulate him for raising the subject of the ABC and giving us an opportunity to speak on this matter. The issues are not as cut and dry as the wording of the motion would indicate. I think it is a question of balance. The motion should be about the whole culture of current affairs programs. I should say first and foremost that I am pleased to support the ABC in some way as its studio is in my electorate. I acknowledge the value of the ABC's contribution not only to my electorate but also to the South Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a trend, not only in the ABC but also in other television and radio, to get away from the hard-edge current affairs program and move towards chat programs, which of course have some value and are certainly popular in the community, but there is no substitute for good investigative journalism. I think the ABC has some responsibility in that respect. The ABC also has a responsibility to provide balance not only in reporting current affairs issues but also in reporting state and national issues, as well as international ones. As communications improve, there is a greater opportunity for us all to be better informed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister for communications has been quoted fairly extensively today and I quote him again. He has said that the ABC has a responsibility to broadcast prime time, state based current affairs programs. But that is in addition to his argument of favouring a move towards a national approach, which I would have to say that I support, as long as there is that balance. When newspapers in various states concentrate heavily on state and local issues, it is important that the ABC can give balance and so greater insight into national issues. While nationally a 7.30 report is a good idea, it should not be at the expense of localism, because there is a need for state based issues also to be examined in detail. If one night a week and at 10.30 was to be the only time that could happen, it would be a poor thing for each of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could also argue that people from various parts of Australia could do with a dose of exposure to the differing cultures from different parts of Australia. Because we are a very large country, the number of states, the different regions and the different cultures all add up to the diversity of our country. We could all benefit if some of that diversity were brought to bear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current affairs programs are very important in terms of investigative journalism. Apart from moving towards the chat shows, there has been an ever increasing move in news broadcasts towards the quick grab. A half-hour program balanced, I would argue, between state and local issues with some national and international flavour has a very important part to play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to be aware of the danger of being entirely Sydney based. I have had the personal experience of having a friend in New South Wales ring me and say, `Make sure you watch the national news because you and others that you know are going to feature on it.' But when I watched the news I found the issue was not important enough to be seen on our own state based program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as this is important in television, it is important in radio. I note that ABC radio in Adelaide often interviews people like Paul Lyneham and Geoff Kitney, so it gets some flavour from Canberra. I think that is a good thing. Once again, I think it is all about balance. I hope that individual television and radio managers within the ABC can have influence. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential replacement of the nightly locally based <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> with a weekly program is simply not adequate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part (3) of this motion calls for the enhancement of regional and state based programming in the national and commercial broadcasting systems.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>Since the first reading of this bill on 24 August this year, I have received widespread and strong support for this bill and its clear intentions. The aim of the bill is to ensure that Australia's defence forces do not engage in any sort of cooperative activity&mdash;be that joint training exercises or exchange of officers, equipment, technical knowledge, intelligence information, military hardware or any other assistance&mdash;with the armed forces of another country which uses those forces in a deliberate act of state policy to suppress the human rights of its own people or the people of another country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bill which, if it were enacted, would lay a very solid foundation of principles to our defence and security links with other nations. It builds upon the clearly stated objectives of Australian foreign policy set out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Rights Manual</EMPHASIS> 1993 of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The manual states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia accords a high priority to the promotion and protection of human rights in the international sphere. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In taking a leading role in international human rights, the Australian Government is conscious of its moral obligation to reflect in its foreign policy the democratic and individual values of Australian society. This position amounts in effect to translating good citizenship to the international arena.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By embracing the cause of those who have been denied their human rights, Australia also guards and reinforces the nature of those rights themselves. More generally, in the longer term, the evolution of just and tolerant societies brings its own international returns&mdash;in higher standards of international behaviour and in the contribution that internal stability makes to regional and international peace and security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia considers that the standards set out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Universal Declaration</EMPHASIS> have an application which transcends national borders: human rights therefore constitute a legitimate subject for international security and concern, and Australia does not accept that the treatment of human rights constitutes an "internal affair" for any country.</PARA>
<PARA>This private member's bill also reflects Australia's obligation under a number of international treaties, conventions and protocols. First and foremost of these is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 1948 and ratified by Australia soon after, with its associated International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two optional protocols. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is also a signatory to the four Geneva conventions of 1949 and the two additional protocols of 1977. Again, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Rights Manual</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While human rights and international humanitarian law ostensibly inhabit different fields, examination of the Geneva rules reveals how they are intimately related to universal protection of human rights, especially in relation to internal situations. In fact, it is difficult to distinguish where human rights end and humanitarian law begins. Even the basic view that one relates to peacetime and the other to wartime situations is not totally correct: for example, both the ICCPR&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the European Convention recognise the application of human rights in times of armed conflict. Both human rights and humanitarian legal protections therefore apply as a matter of course to civilians in times of armed conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most important protections from a human rights perspective afforded by the Geneva Conventions is "Common Article 3", so called because it is found in all four Conventions, which ensures that some basic protection is accorded to civilians in all situations&mdash;whether it be international or civil wars, or wars of national liberation. Not only does this provision ensure that persons not involved in combat are treated humanely and without discrimination, but it also sets out absolute prohibitions against violence to persons, (including murder, torture and mutilation, hostage taking, outrages on the person's dignity such as humiliating and degrading treatment), and provides for due process.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Rights Manual</EMPHASIS> sets out a very firm foundation for the way in which we should be acting as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that our nation, its government and our defence forces have a clear, unambiguous responsibility to at all times act in accordance with our own commitments to human rights and our agreed international obligations. Australia's defence forces have one of the best reputations in the world for courage, determination, compassion, respect for human rights and dignity and for strategic and technical knowledge and skills. They are a credit to our nation and it is no wonder we pay homage to our Defence Force heroes for the services they regularly perform for our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the majority of Australian people, nor the vast majority of members of the defence forces, believe that our nation's interests are served by engaging in defence cooperation with armed forces which do not practise the same high standards of service, behaviour or morality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill under debate today does not mention any particular nation as being the target. This bill, if passed, would require the Australian department of foreign affairs to engage in careful scrutiny of the operations of the armed forces of all nations with which Australia has any form of defence cooperation. It is clear, however, that with only a few nations would any defence cooperation be brought into question. Indonesia is clearly the most obvious and is a country where the evidence is overwhelming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a few weeks, we will be marking the 20th anniversary of the Indonesian military invasion of the former Portuguese colony of East Timor. In early December 1975, Indonesia sent over 30,000 troops into East Timor, engaging in the systematic destruction of thousands of homes, killing more than 60,000 East Timorese and beating and torturing thousands of others. So commenced a 20-year reign of terror over East Timor by the Indonesian military which has resulted in over 200,000 people being killed, some 60,000 refugees fleeing the island for other places around the world and a continuing repression of the rights and liberties of the people of East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not one government or international body around the world which does not accept that East Timor has been subjected to Indonesian military tyranny at its worst. Yet the Australian government believes that it is fair and reasonable to engage in defence cooperation, joint military exercises, officer training, et cetera with the very forces that have been used to kill and torture East Timorese people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation reached the height of complete hypocrisy when the very officer who led the attack by Indonesian forces on Balibo&mdash;where five Australian journalists died in 1975 because they were exposing the excesses of the Indonesians&mdash;came to Australia and participated in the Kangaroo 95 exercises. We have condemned these killings as a nation and now we are playing war games with the killers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians also hold the view that Australia is weakening its own security and defence by exposing all of our technical and strategic knowledge and information to the armed forces of the very nation which is still identified as our major threat should political and economic circumstances change in the region. It is absolute folly to believe that we are improving the training or actions of the Indonesian military by cooperating with them. There is no evidence at all&mdash;as the 1991 Dili massacre and the recent beatings, arrest and torture of 150 youths just last week show&mdash;that the Indonesian military has any concern for human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time for our nation to honour our commitment to human rights and to refuse to cooperate in defence areas with nations, like Indonesia, which show such contempt for the principles and values our people hold. I urge support for the Defence Cooperation Control Bill 1995. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with some interest to the speech the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) made in addressing the Defence Cooperation Control Bill 1995. Whilst I would agree with the honourable member on many issues, I do have a little difficulty in agreeing with his precise position on this one. It is not because I do not agree with the importance of human rights&mdash;I am very supportive of human rights, and I think we do have to address those issues&mdash;but we are talking about a particular bill that the member is presenting to the House that, on the surface, is designed to talk about defence cooperation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought by this stage I would probably have had to pull some teeth to get to the basis of this bill. But halfway into the member's address, he clearly highlighted what it is about: it is his understanding that it is about Indonesia and East Timor. In that regard I have no difficulty with the issues he addressed. However, frankly, there are some issues in that area which I think all Australians have some concern about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill goes far further than to address the problems of particular areas. This bill looks at the use of our armed forces in training and developing the skills of military, and gaining exchange benefits throughout the world with those activities. The bill does not address just East Timor; it looks at countries right around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill requires that the Minister for Foreign Affairs provide a certificate to be given to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, the Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Staff and that it also be presented in parliament within six days of the minister receiving it. Also, that certificate is to be based on information, collected by our Foreign Affairs representatives overseas, as to whether there is any conflict that the military forces of a particular country are involved with that would be seen as a human rights issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the surface, once again, I have no real problems with the principles that the member is putting forward. But there are many areas of conflict where countries in our region could find themselves with their people within causing them difficulties. For example, if we look at the situation in the Philippines, would the Philippines be precluded because of the Muslim groups to the south of the country? I suspect it would. On the basis of what I have read in the information&mdash;and I am not sure whether that is a line that the member would intend to be precluded in that process&mdash;I think the bill provides far too rigid a line for a Prime Minister or for a Chief of the Defence Force to work to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With human rights, I think it is important that we have dialogue. Dialogue is one of the greatest areas on which we can rely through which we can achieve a change in people's views. In fact, if there had been more dialogue in connection with Yugoslavia, maybe there would not be some of the difficulties in trying to reach peace solutions that there are today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of provision of training, I think our defence forces have done a wonderful job in years gone by with their work on training courses in Australia and in other countries with officers of other military forces. I think it is important that we build up our links with the military leaders of forces in all countries around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that, if we get into a conflict at some stage in the future&mdash;and, heaven forbid, would I hate to see that situation arise&mdash;it is far easier to be able to open dialogue with somebody on the other side when you know them. It is far better to be able to work the processes through and to talk the system out, understanding, firstly, some of the thinking that some of these people have but also with their understanding you as a human being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a human rights point of view, when we get past the bells and whistles of this piece of legislation&mdash;which talk about putting in place a very rigid process&mdash;and get down to what occurs on the ground and what we can achieve out of continuing and worthwhile dialogue, I am confident that a far better dialogue can be achieved by the arrangements we have seen in place with our defence forces over the years. Are we really suggesting in this bill&mdash;because the member has highlighted the issue with Indonesia&mdash;that we cut off each and every negotiation with Indonesia in a defence capability?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that is what this legislation really does say because it talks about any of the negotiations and discussions, any elements of training. I just think to do that would be to work exactly against the aims that we should have in this country&mdash;and one of those is building up a better understanding of how we work so that in the future we can resolve many of the problems that we will come to face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the member for Moreton said that this bill does not mention any particular nation as being the target and that he would have liked us to talk about the Defence Cooperation Control Bill as being something that can be looked at for all nations of the world, 50 per cent of his contribution was devoted to Indonesia and East Timor. I suspect that he believes in his heart that is what the bill was established to do in the first place. I am not sure that the foundation of the bill before us at the moment has been a good foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could work on the basis of saying, `Our people from Foreign Affairs in the field have got all the solutions as to how we sort out our defence relations.' Basically, the bill says that we should use whatever evidence can be put together from the diplomatic posts in the country. That information would then be provided to the minister in the form of a certificate. Information regarding how that was determined and who would and would not be involved would be determined by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and then passed on to the minister. We would then go through that process of organising our cooperation with defence forces overseas. That would create a massive administrative system that is not necessary. We put in place in this country under our democratic processes a government of the day which will make decisions in the interests of the people. Frankly, if we were to put in place a mechanism whereby there can be a considerable amount of argument over who does and who does not get involved in defence cooperation with Australia, it would only create more and more unnecessary paperwork. I would be far happier to see the funds that would be consumed in that area being spent more wisely in the area of cooperation. Frankly, if the member for Moreton were to think through that process, I am sure he would think of more constructive ways to solve the difficulties in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A copy of the certificate is to be provided to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence. If we are going to organise this cooperation, it is fairly clear that the minister would be aware of the processes anyway. In some areas, I would suspect that, if those negotiations had not been established and were to be initiated, the Prime Minster would be made aware of the arrangements, particularly if it is a very low level of training. We are not training these forces to be at the top echelon and to be as capable as we are in many of these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Moreton did not particularly want to discuss the conflict in Bougainville, but was he suggesting that we are not going to have any training relations with Papua New Guinea because of it? I am concerned about some of the comments that I have read about the human rights abuses in that area. But to suggest that, as a result of this, a certificate would be presented that showed that there was some conflict between the people in the country and the defence forces which meant that we would not have a military relationship with Papua New Guinea is ludicrous. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) for the thoughtfulness and imagination in the Defence Cooperation Control Bill and rise to second the bill and support it. There is no doubt that everyone in this chamber has a commitment to human rights. That is a notable feature of Australian political life. The strength in this parliament of Amnesty International is a very clear indication of the fact that commitment to human rights has the strong support of people in all parties and the Independents as well in this House. The question is not whether that is at issue but what we can do to encourage the implementation of human rights in other countries. The honourable member for Moreton has imaginatively thought out one way of influencing that outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say, by the way, that the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), in supporting the idea of dialogue, was supporting something which is in no sense inconsistent with the bill that is before us. Quite clearly, dialogue is the first and most obvious technique to use when trying to influence the development of human rights in other countries and is in many ways the most constructive technique because it does not involve attempting to enforce anything. It involves simply open discussion, which can well have an influence. The flow of ideas is one of the most effective ways of influencing the way any individual or country behaves. </PARA>

Fortunately, there has been a growth in democracy and in commitment to human rights, including political and civil rights and also economic, social and cultural rights, over the last decade or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reiteration of that commitment in the Vienna conference two years ago is another restatement of what is now a strong tradition within the UN system&mdash;first articulated in the charter of the UN, then in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and finally in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The tradition and the commitment is strong in this country and in many other countries, but continuing to urge implementation remains important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already in place another procedure which is very similar to that which is proposed by the honourable member for Moreton with exactly the same goal, and that is the way we handle trade in arms. We already have a procedure which requires consultation between the defence department and the foreign affairs department, careful evaluation of countries to which we may export weapons and an approval system which comes into operation only when it is clear that weapons are not going to be automatically or seriously misused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This procedure is very similar to that which the honourable member for Moreton is proposing. He is proposing that the foreign affairs department would evaluate a country with which the defence department was considering cooperating and it would then issue a certificate provided it was clear that cooperation was not going to contribute in any way to suppression of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That kind of procedure is relatively simple. It may not be absolutely straightforward to implement, because there are always countries which are borderline in relation to behaviour.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I obviously acknowledge the good faith and good intentions of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in putting forward this private member's bill, the Defence Cooperation Control Bill. My comments in no way should be taken to diminish or criticise his honest intentions in this very important matter. However, as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and as one who was able to participate at the end of the subcommittee's work in the report that has been tabled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Review of Australia's Efforts to Promote and Protect Human Rights</EMPHASIS>, which I commend to all members, I think the report is well worth reading in the context of the honourable member's bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I can see&mdash;and in the couple of minutes I have it is very difficult to summarise a report of this magnitude accurately and not to misinterpret it&mdash;the report clearly acknowledges, after very careful deliberation about the complexities of our world and about the operation of Australia's role in peacekeeping, that the use of armed forces, regretfully, is on the agenda and has to be part of Australia's role in the world. Indeed, we have a very proud record of participation by our armed forces in peacekeeping in the world. We are not seen as a threat to anyone, yet we have been welcomed and we have done good work in respect of using our armed forces in peacekeeping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the effect of this bill could shackle the operation of this nation and its participation with respect to peacekeeping. On page 84, paragraph 5.2, there is a summary of the declaration of the charter of the United Nations which we all try to support and subscribe to. In this 50th year of the United Nations we should all reflect on it. Part of that charter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, and to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the criterion a government of the people elected by the people of Australia has to balance: `in the common interest'. The wording of the bill acknowledges that United Nations' operations which affect the rights of people in a state or another state are okay. I refer to clause No. 10, which says that, notwithstanding everything beforehand, it will be okay for Australia, if it is part of a UN operation, to become involved in, unfortunately, a deliberate policy affecting the rights of people in another state. But the bill says that, in all other operations that are not United Nations' operations, it is not okay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the honourable member feels that perhaps I have oversimplified it, but that is the effect of the bill on international law and domestic law. The United Nations charter acknowledges the possibility that member nations will have to unite for the common good and sometimes provide armed forces for the purposes of indirectly or directly affecting the rights of people in a state or in another state. That is an unfortunate consequence of UN operations and peacekeeping operations generally. So it really is unrealistic for legislation of this type to be carried to shackle a government in performing its duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I personally think that dialogue is the solution. In respect of these conflicts that do arise, dialogue by a nation such as Australia with a reputation, good will and an acceptance by many nations is the way to go. Whilst success does not come overnight with respect to responsible dialogue, you do win in the end. That is why I support our cooperation with some of our Asian countries and with New Guinea. Sometimes I get very concerned about reports of their operations in their domestic fields and with their neighbours. But if we are to cut off our relations and dialogue with them, we are going to have a worse situation in the region and for the world eventually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is far better not to try to legislate, albeit in good faith, but to use our commonsense, the principles of the United Nations charter and the examples we have set ourselves as a nation in peacekeeping to achieve the right sort of cooperation and to be prepared where necessary to protect people's interests by using our armed forces in a peaceful way. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the constitution was written, there were no aeroplanes and there was no television. There was certainly no national economy, because most of the powers resided with the major states of New South Wales and Victoria at the time, up until the Second World War when uniform income taxation came about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, we have seen since the war the development of an Australian national economy. When the country suffers trend terms of trade problems as we have seen with the decline of our traditional commodity since 1950, there requires a policy reaction&mdash;in the 1980s&mdash;to change dramatically fiscal policy in this country. Because of uniform taxation, the Commonwealth government of the day, this government, was able to change national fiscal policy. It would not be able to do so were it to be fractured back to the states. If you look at all of the federations which have worked, you see that they have worked when they have had an omnibus taxation power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is this absolutely phoney debate going on&mdash;it has gone on for years&mdash;amongst conservatives, who in part we funded through some of these little think-tanks, about vertical fiscal imbalance. At its source it means that ministers of the states will be more careful and more wary about spending money if they in fact raise it. That is like saying that, in the Commonwealth cabinet, ministers would pay particular attention to a cabinet submission that was funded off Commonwealth revenue but if it was funded off the deficit they would have a different view of it. Of course, that is a complete and total nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has resisted giving taxing powers to the states for that reason. We have resisted giving them a share of income tax because when the revenue falls they suffer massive losses. That would have been the case in 1991-92, when I think somewhere of the order of $4 billion to $6 billion&mdash;I cannot remember exactly&mdash;of that sort of loss would have been occasioned by the fall in income tax, were they to have had a fixed share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Treasurer pointed out the other day, now that the Commonwealth revenue is rising to cut the deficit and bring it back into surplus, the cost to the Commonwealth would have been an extra $2.8 billion over three years. That is, if in 1995-96 general revenue grants to the states totalled $15.7 billion, or 13.2 per cent of Commonwealth tax revenue, and had the opposition maintained revenue grants, as a Commonwealth, to the states at this share of Commonwealth tax revenues, they would be paying the states an extra $671 million in 1996-97, $708 million in 1997-98 and $1.382 billion in 1998-99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the states will not accept a loss with a big fall in the Commonwealth revenues because they cannot tolerate the loss. That is why we have given them real terms per capita, a real terms increase plus population growth, as a much better alternative than the big sinusoidal effects of losses coming up and then gains coming through the Commonwealth budget which need to be put off the deficit or the surplus. This, though, is not the view of the opposition. The shadow Treasurer said in a statement issued on Friday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal coalition's policy is to provide the states with a fixed share of Commonwealth revenue to address the current uncertainties.</PARA>
<PARA>That was as a smother for the real policy, which is to give them tax powers. Let me take just his admission only. Where anywhere, in anything you have said to date, are you saying that you will cover the $2.8 billion of effects that you are acknowledging are part of your policy? If you are saying that you will give them a fixed share of income tax, have you anywhere said where you will get the $2.8 billion to do it? Or dare we suggest to the press gallery that they ask you? Would it be a shocking thing for them to say, `Mr Costello, you have already admitted that you will give a fixed share of income tax to the states. Where will you find, as the Treasurer indicates, $2.8 billion for the next three years?' Not a bad question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was not really what the discussion was about. An article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> by Mr Forman stated:</PARA>

This is what I am talking about when I say that they can have no credibility or honesty in politics without policies. Secret policy development means that they have got the state treasuries in the conservative governments burrowing away, and they have got Mr Cliff Walsh, a former adviser to Mr Fraser, and now Mr Dean Brown burrowing away at it.

While the participation of women in decision making positions in the UN has improved ever so slightly, it is not surprising that it has not increased very much, because the countries represented there have not done much better than that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members who were present at question time last week would recall seeing the Leader of the National Party in a lather of orgiastic delight as he brandished a one-year-old copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist </EMPHASIS>magazine, purporting to show that the level of inequality in Australia was comparatively high compared to other developed countries. I hate to spoil the Leader of the National Party's day but, in fact, his quotation of those statistics was completely erroneous and misleading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a set of bar graphs in that issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist </EMPHASIS>that seemed to be the basis of the Leader of the National Party's claim. If you analyse that set of charts, the reality is that the Australian data that was utilised failed to make a technical adjustment for family size, which has the consequence of overstating the degree of inequality in this country by about two to one. If you make that simple correction, that alone is sufficient to completely transform the picture. The suggestion that the Leader of the National Party was making on that occasion was completely misleading and wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comparisons between countries in terms of inequality and the distributive effect of the tax and transfer systems have to take account of the fact that most other countries, particularly in Europe, have social insurance base systems where people make contributions during their working lives towards their retirement incomes. The effect of those sorts of systems is to bring about a very substantial redistribution to the same individuals over the course of their life cycles. If you actually do the analysis properly, it turns out that, in terms of redistribution between people, our system is highly redistributive in comparison to those systems where many of the analyses overstate the degree of redistribution by taking into account that life cycle effect that you get in social insurance systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer honourable members to the recent EPAC report on inequality, which actually made use of OECD data to tabulate a number of measures of inequality. One of the most significant was a set of tables that looked at the current situation and trends over time in terms of the ratio of people at the ninth decal point in the income distribution to those at the first decal point&mdash;in other words, the ratio of the incomes of those 10 per cent from the top to those 10 per cent from the bottom. On that sort of measure, particularly in comparison with the other English speaking countries, it turns out that Australia has a relatively high equitable income distribution. By comparison with the United States, for example, the degree of inequality is about half here. By comparison with the UK, the degree of inequality is about one-third less. I would like to table a series of graphs which sets that out very clearly and shows very starkly and graphically what the real situation is in terms of equity in this country compared with a number of other comparable countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I make the obvious point. All the policy prescriptions we have heard from the opposition are unambiguously regressive at all points when you can actually get to grips with what they are saying&mdash;whether it be taking apart the social safety net to introduce a system of industrial relations, which in all countries in which it has been introduced has had the effect of increasing earnings in equality. The protestations of concern are the usual collection of hypocrisy. I refer honourable members to the series of charts which I have just tabled which show the actual position very clearly.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, notwithstanding the Government's (a) refusal to stand down the Minister for Human Services and Health until questions of honesty are resolved, (b) reckless indifference to standards of honesty in public life and (c) wilful and deliberate breach of election promises, this House reaffirms the importance of truth in public life as essential to preserving confidence in government.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, I am absolutely delighted at this unexpected opportunity&mdash;absolutely delighted! I was asked by my colleague the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) whether there was any urgency about a motion which asks the parliament to debate the dishonesty of the government. If ever one wanted some evidence of the urgency of this motion, that evidence has been provided by none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during question time today. On our reckoning, in his last dorothy dix alone, the Prime Minister enunciated no fewer than nine lies in the answer that he gave. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will wait for that. So great were the distortions of reality that came from the Prime Minister during the answer to that question, and indeed the answer to other questions, that I was moved to say to my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) that a few years ago we set up a Waste Watch Committee. I think we have now got to set up a lie watch committee in order to examine the statements that are made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue goes to the very heart of the debate that is going to rage in Australia between now and the next election, and that is, who do you believe? Do you believe Paul Keating or do you believe John Howard? Far be it from me to personalise this debate&mdash;it is not my wont to do that&mdash;but if the Prime Minister really wants to make integrity an issue in the next election, if the Prime Minister really wants the Australian people to make a judgment as to who they are going to believe, let me say to the Prime Minister, my Labor opponent, the member for Blaxland, that it sits very easily with those who sit on this side of the House for the next election campaign to be a debate about whether you believe Paul Keating or John Howard. Those who sit on this side of the House have very little doubt as to what the judgment of the Australian people is going to be during the election campaign, if that is the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate gives me a marvellous opportunity to traverse a number of the issues that the Prime Minister touched upon during that extraordinarily dishonest and deceptive answer that he gave before I was asked a question by the member for Warringah. It is very clear that the government have decided on one thing and one thing alone&mdash;that is, the only faint hope they have of winning the next election campaign is to run a campaign based on lies and personal abuse. Every single thing they will do between now and polling day will fit very neatly into either of those descriptions. I expected it of the Prime Minister and his colleague, the man we call `the Laurie of lies'&mdash;the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). When it comes to integrity, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) is battling pretty hard to get into the race. I expected it from them, but I don't know that I expected it from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley). He has always rather paraded himself as being somebody a little better, but he has been sucked into the vortex of dishonesty. He has been sucked into this pattern of lies and personal abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that you only decide to run on a campaign of lies and personal abuse when you don't have anything else to run with. That is the great dilemma that this man, my Labor opponent, faces over the next few months. He cannot run on his record. How can you run on a record when you go to the Australian people saying, `Re-elect us because, cleverly, we have increased the foreign debt by 800 per cent. We tried to make it 1,000 per cent, but we could only make it 800 per cent. Re-elect us because, cleverly, we have increased the cost of servicing the average mortgage in Australia by 50 per cent. We tried to make it 100 per cent, but all we have been able to do since 1983 is lift the figure from $651 a month, on the average loan, to $974 a month. We tried harder and there was a time when we hoped we would say to the Australian people that we could have got it up by 75 per cent, but you'll have to settle for an increase of 50 per cent in the cost.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And you wonder why the battlers of Australia think they are being hard pressed at the moment. What my Labor opponent has done over the last 13 years is push up by 50 per cent the cost of servicing the mortgage payments on the average home. That is why so many of you are shaking in your shoes in those marginal seats. That is why we have so much of this false bravado in those 90-second grabs before question time. You are trying to get together and summon up your 3 a.m. courage, to try to pretend that it is all perfectly all right. But you know perfectly well that it is not all right, and you know darned well that those people who have voted for you, year in and year out, want to know why it is that you have let them down so very badly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So you cannot run on the management of the foreign debt and you cannot run on keeping mortgage rates down, so perhaps you could run on real wages. You could run on the fact that, in the 13 years you have been in power, real wages have actually fallen. You cannot run on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I know what you can really run on. The one thing you could perhaps run on is how the gaps between rich and poor in Australia have disappeared while you have been the Prime Minister of this country. In the course of doing that, perhaps you could explain to the Australian people why it is that, in 1976, 65 per cent of all households in Australia had incomes between $22,000 and $72,000. In constant dollar comparisons, by 1992 that figure had fallen, over that 16 years, from 65 per cent to 40 per cent. That would have to represent the greatest decimation of the stabilising middle class in this country that we have seen since European settlement. So I do not think you will be running on the divide between the rich and the poor. So perhaps you could run on integrity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Opposition members</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Oh, no!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Am I being uncharitable? You could run on all those promises you have kept, Paul. Perhaps you could explain what happened to those l-a-w tax cuts. Perhaps you could explain what happened to that free dental service you promised at Bankstown during the last election campaign. Perhaps you could explain to the Australian public all of those other promises&mdash;that you were not going to put the Medicare levy up, that you were going to maintain living standards and all those other promises that you said you were going to deliver on. So I do not think they are going to run on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You know, perhaps they could run on hope for the future, after having presided over an absolutely scandalous rising youth unemployment rate. In the time my Labor opponent has been either Prime Minister or Treasurer of this country, the average rate of unemployment has stuck at around eight per cent, which is significantly higher than it was under the seven years of the previous government. Those sorts of comparisons can be made in so many areas. So I do not think they are going to run on hope for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So you cannot run on your record, although I wish you would. You cannot run on integrity&mdash;although, please, run on integrity. I would love you to do that. You cannot run on offering hope for the future. So all you have left to do is run on lies and personal abuse. That is what we have been treated to today. That is why this motion I have moved is urgent. That is why I am very pleased it has been brought on for debate today. It gives the House an opportunity to examine the behaviour of the Prime Minister, to examine the behaviour of those opposite and particularly to examine the way in which they have tried to lie about and distort the attitudes of the coalition on particular policy issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the most emphatic denial by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, what did the Prime Minister do today? He lied through his teeth about our taxation policy. What has he said about Medicare? He said that we are going to rip the guts out of Medicare&mdash;another lie. He said that we are going to take away penalty rates&mdash;another lie. He said that we are going to take away sick leave&mdash;another lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Doesn't it pass very strange?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, you do. You think it is wrong. That is very strange. Why don't you have a look at some of the examples in the One Nation statement? One of the examples of best industrial relations practice that was held up for everybody to see in the One Nation statement was the ICI Botany arrangement whereby the very thing that I have described was in fact practised. What they did there was to get hold of the penalty rates and the holiday loading and cash them out. Everybody got a higher wage. Everybody was better off. They worked less hours. They were better off. The company operated better. Everybody was happy, and you think that is a lousy arrangement. All I can is say is: you go on interjecting and you go on saying those sorts of arrangements are very bad.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that, under our policy, Australian workers will enjoy higher wages because there will be higher productivity. There are no circumstances in which a Howard government would cut the wages of Australian workers. There will be no circumstances in which sick leave is taken away. This attempt by the government, this attempt by the Prime Minister, this attempt by the Deputy Prime Minister to spread this veneer of lies and distortions about our policy merely underlines one very salient feature&mdash;that is, after 12 1/2 to 13 years they have got very tired of you, after 12 1/2 and 13 years they no longer believe you, after 12 1/2 to 13 years they no  longer believe that you can be trusted with their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They know that their living standards have gone down. You know that hundreds of thousands of your traditional voters are revolting against what you have done over the last 13 years. That is what Mick Young told you in the wake of the Queensland election. That is what Maher, the former president of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, said at the recent meeting of that particular union. It is being said all over the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that that charge by your own supporters hurts. I know it stings because it is true and it brings home the reality of what has happened over the last 13 years. You have this ridiculous situation that your leader is left with these absurd diversions about attacking the management of superannuation funds in Australia. Instead of facing up to a proper debate about alternative approaches to the government of this country, what does he do? All he does is distort and mislead the Australian people and the Australian parliament about what we are going to do. That is all he does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister talks about there being no truth or honesty in politics. He ought to know all about that. Over the last three weeks we have seen this unofficial election campaign go into overdrive largely at the instigation of the Prime Minister. During that time, has there been any attempt by the Prime Minister to seriously analyse the achievements of his government? No. What the Prime Minister has done over that period of time is to deliberately lie and distort the policies of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One minute the Prime Minister says that I have no policies at all. We heard this remarkable litany from the Prime Minister when I became Leader of the Opposition at the beginning of this year. He said, `Don't take any notice of him. He is a creature of the 1950s.' Those opposite went on with that and they would occasionally fast forward me to the 1970s but basically I was a creature of the 1950s. They tried that for a while and then they decided to give that away because it was not really biting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then they said, `I know what we're going to do. We're now going to say that he's got no policy.' Then they tried that month after month. They said, `He's got no policy.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the official line, is it? No policies today, dangerous policies tomorrow, is it? You roster policies off one day and you roster them on the next. Those opposite tried this line that I have no policies. Then they decided that was not working. The next thing they tried to do was say, `Not only has he got a lot of policies, but his policies are so dangerous and so draconian and they are so full of fear and loathing that they are going to rip apart the fabric of Australian society.' How can you take a crowd seriously that really invites ridicule from the Australian people&mdash;in the first breath to say he has no policy so he should be completely ignored and in the next breadth to say his policies are so full of menace and loathing that they are going to rip apart the fabric of Australian society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That reminds us very much of the bravura of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) last Thursday when he said, `The problem with the coalition's wages policy is that you won't be able to control the upward movement of wages under a coalition.' Only a minute earlier his leader, the Prime Minister, had said that I was going to cut wages. Three minutes after Simon Crean sat down, the Prime Minister was up again saying, `You don't want to elect Howard because he is going to cut wages.' Government members ought to make up their minds; they are saying that wages will go up and go down. Wages will either go up, down or sideways. The reality is that the government has no coherent response to the coalition at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the point I made at the beginning of this motion and the reason I am delighted this motion has come on today. It is important that this motion be debated today because it is important that, in the words of the motion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this House reaffirms the importance of truth in public life as essential to preserving confidence in government.</PARA>
<PARA>There is little doubt that one of the worst features of Australian politics at the present time is the breakdown of trust between the Australian people and their elected governments. And the man more than anybody else who is responsible for that is Paul Keating. Paul Keating has done far more to destroy the trust of ordinary Australians in the honesty of government than any other person who has stalked the federal political stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that this motion come on because it gives the House an opportunity to reaffirm the importance of those principles. Those principles have been highlighted today by the answers given by the Prime Minister, which have demonstrated amply not only to us but to those listening to these proceedings how the government is absolutely bereft of any strategy to handle the next election campaign, other than a strategy which is built on lies and personal abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the past few weeks, we have seen an absolute deluge of personal abuse and personal attacks. All I can say to the Prime Minister is this: You go ahead and continue with that personal abuse and those personal attacks. Every time you engage in them, you go further back in the public's esteem. I do not think anybody on this side of the parliament should be particularly concerned that you are continuing with that strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the lies and distortions that the Prime Minister is engaged in, every time he lies about and distorts our policies, he reminds the Australian people of the paucity of the arguments he has in the lead-up to the next election&mdash;just as his constant harping on my past record and his constant harping a few months ago on the past record of other people in the coalition proclaimed to the Australian people that he is obsessed about the past because he has no answer to today's problems and offers no hope for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that government members will base their campaign on lies and distortions. They have demonstrated these lies and distortions in relation to our industrial relations policy, with the absolute lie that we would take away sick leave entitlements, the absolute lie that we would take away penalty rates, the absolute lie that we would take away superannuation and the absolute lie that we would cut wages under a Howard government. All of those are complete lies and fabrications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that you have engaged in that action demonstrates very clearly to the Australian public that you cannot run on your record because you are ashamed of it, that you have no integrity to offer the Australian people because they will not believe you and that you have no hope to offer to future generations of Australians. That is why you are left with a contemptible, residual campaign approach of running on lies and personal abuse. The more you do it, the more you proclaim your inadequacy and your unfitness to be returned as the government of this country at the next election. </PARA>

That was only one thing he dribbled out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were other things. Support of industrial legislation around the country: every time we see it, we see an echo of the things he stood for in the past, such as when he again, in a matter of opportunism a few weeks ago, got up and said&mdash;after years of pleading with the government to build a third runway at Mascot airport&mdash;that he not only would bring the capacity of it back by 40 per cent with a cross-runway heading but also would spike the government's legislation in the Senate, which is on this week, to allow the privatisation of the airports around this country to get the changes that the airports need.

But what does he say? `I want security from Asia. I want to go back to the United States.' He is looking for the insularity. He is always hankering after the monoculture. Whenever he has had a chance to beat the immigration drum, he has. He is always hankering after the monoculture. He does not realise that the negotiation with Asia is not complete.

<PARA>He said, and this is high humbug, `We want to assert the very simple principle that truth is absolute, truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life.' This is coming from somebody who over a long period has shown very clear indifference to those things&mdash;whether it be in his remarks about the royal commission that he actually refers to or in his connivance with the Western Australian Premier in setting it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He asserted an untruth in his speech that, within the government's period in office, real wages have fallen; yet they have risen by 7.2 per cent over the period. He said, `The very simple principle is that truth is absolute, that truth is never disposable.' But as Treasurer he promised a set of tax cuts in 1977 and took them away five months later. He said he would preserve Medibank and then destroyed it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then he says of the government that we have not got any integrity in policy when in fact our most solemn commitment at the last election was to restore the economy to growth and to employment. We have had record growth in employment and record falls in unemployment since we have been keeping the records. We have had job growth of 670,000&mdash;the hardest thing of all to put into place. We have had strong employment growth, which is very much in line with the targets we put into the One Nation program in 1991. The first year undershot and all the other years overshot or met their target. Both the tax cuts and the superannuation will pay more than the One Nation commitments. We were responsible for the introduction and payment of the generalised child-care rebate. We created the home child-care allowance and the parenting allowance, both of which have gone into place, and a structure for the republic. These are all expressed commitments of the election campaign and they have all been put into place. </PARA>

We've now got huge participation rates, but even against that we've got falling unemployment levels. They've introduced the child-care rebate and the home child-care allowance. They did put into place a structured republic.' What have we seen from you? Slipping and sliding on the republic, badmouthing the changes which the government is able to put into place, trying to wreck the ones in 1992 in the Senate, in the budget, and now trying to wreck the privatisation program.

The central promise of your election manifesto was that you could introduce income tax cuts without a GST. And what happened after the election? Not one Australian saw those income tax cuts, those l-a-w tax cuts, for one day. They are due to be introduced on 1 January 1996. They will not take effect for one dollar for one Australian for one day. That is because this Prime Minister was elected on a platform of complete fraud at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the Prime Minister say about this? He says he will deliver tax cuts and that he will be delivering them in 2001. Anybody can work out that in five years time, after bracket creep has clawed back all of those tax cuts and after people have been denied tax cuts for five years, not only are they out of pocket for five years but they have also paid the increased tax claw by bracket creep. Giving money in 2001 rather than 1996 is no substitute at all. In any event, people would not even get the money in 2001, when it finally gets to three per cent. Who would get the money in 2001?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has taken away the legislated l-a-w tax cuts and is not giving them to people&mdash;we cannot trust them to the people&mdash;on 1 January.

As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> said today, the Prime Minister went off his brain, attacking the AMP and other people not because he had suddenly worked out they were not selling bonds at the right moment. That is not any new development. It was not as if some return had come out that we had never seen before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why this Prime Minister was upset&mdash;this is on the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;was that his mates had not got the outcome in Coles Myer that he would have preferred. So this Prime Minister turned on superannuation funds, which are the very cornerstone of his superannuation policy. There is no logic to it whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your own Prime Minister has thrown into doubt the savings of all of those Australians who, as a result, do not have confidence in superannuation funds, which he, the Prime Minister of this country, has branded as donkeys and lemmings. So we now have the situation where everybody is going to have 12 per cent taken out of their pay, where they are going to have a three per cent income tax cut, to be paid to donkeys. That is the bottom line of this wonderful superannuation policy that this government is talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it was not just the l-a-w income tax cuts that were stolen from the Australian people. As well as that, there was the commitment that there would be no increases in tax. And what did we get? We got a one per cent and then another one per cent increase in the wholesale sales tax.

Of course, if you had been putting that in place during the recession, it would have been $4 billion to $6 billion down. You did not know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the problem with you. You did not know, in your absolutely pathetic ignorance, that when you got up and said in your smart smarmy way, `Of course, we are prepared to discuss the conditions of vertical fiscal imbalance, because I'm a great Treasury spokesman. I know all about these things. I'm a total economic genius. Thank God I've been put upon the Liberal Party,' that you were in fact tumbling your agenda. Vertical fiscal imbalance addressed by state taxes&mdash;state income taxes or state GST. Talk about liars in this place. You try to hide behind this document or hide behind the fact that you are responsible for this document. You have been engaged in these discussions. You are there quoting, obviously showing you have been engaged in these discussions. Do you think that you would say something like this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difference between us and the Commonwealth is that we are willing to discuss these proposals. The government is not. Keating's view of Canberra, of government, is that he wants everything controlled by Canberra and everything controlled by him.</PARA>
<PARA>Out there in the ether is this just a statement de novo standing out there on its own&mdash;a single individual statement&mdash;or does it come off the stuff that we are talking about here that you have said you have been involved in to the people who are producing this article? Is it a conspiracy by your lovely little state governments and one or two little business groups to produce your real taxation policies by September-October next year? Isn't it the way? Doesn't this come off the quotes of all of you after the last election? `What was our big mistake on the GST? Not that it was an inequitable hopeless policy and not that it was devastating for the ordinary person in this country. No, we were stupid to do it up-front.' Haven't you been trying to conceal that ever since? John Howard gets out of the bottle and the genie has to be put back in. Your parliamentary assistant gets out of the bottle and he has to be put back in. There is one after another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We get accused of lying when we draw attention to these statements. These are not the statements from the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). He does not get up and say, `The opposition hankers after the GST. It is the opposition which says it is inevitable and it is going to be introduced,' and then I get up here and quote him. I am quoting your parliamentary assistant. Then they say, `Oh, gee, he's a liar.' You have these quotes from the parliamentary assistant saying it is inevitable that there will be a GST. They say, `Heck, he's a liar! You're telling lies about our policies.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We get industrial relations policies up here. We quote John Howard saying that the West Australian legislation is a template&mdash;a model&mdash;for him. The opposition says, `Gee, you're liars. Fancy quoting John Howard saying that and believing it was the truth!' That is the implication of what you are saying. The implication of what you are saying is that, if we actually quote what John Howard says, by your normal, sensible English translation of what it would mean, we are lying. If you quote what the leader says and you say that it is what he means, we must be liars because obviously the leader would never say what he means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not put up with the Leader of the Opposition coming in here as he does day after day with his views on the changing perspective of industrial relations. He tells us how their policy is being devised, looking at every single criticism that Laurie Brereton might make or that I might make or that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) might make. He says what we all have to say and then devises a policy to deny it. That is their proposition. That is where they are coming from until they get caught out by making statements to the Business Council, which the Premier of Victoria spoke to. Richard Court comes out and says, `I had a chat with John Howard; he has no problems with the policies. I support it.' He goes to Keirath and after Keirath comes out of those conversations he says, `He supports 90 per cent of what I am doing.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition goes to Western Australia and says that as far as he is concerned it is a model&mdash;a template&mdash;for him. The government says all those things. We say that it is a model or a template. We say, `Let's discuss these things through with the West Australians and indicate to them that they support it.' We say that Graham Keirath has come out and said that the opposition supports this legislation. We say that he has had conversations with Richard Court and given him these assurances. He says, `You are lying; that is a lie.' We merely may have revealed all of this, but when you say it obviously we would not say that. They say, `You're a liar.' That is a most extraordinary situation&mdash;to be called a liar by people who are directly quoting the people whom the opposition is led by, whether they be the deputy leader, the leader, the opposition's industrial relations spokesmen or their various Premiers around the country. We quote them and we are called liars when we are quoting them. It says a hell of a lot for them. It says a hell of a lot for the newspapers that are supposed to be reporting their remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there a bigger liar in Australian politics than the man who went to the last election campaign and said, `I have in my possession the industrial relations legislation'&mdash;not the policy proposals&mdash;`that I propose to introduce. I am prepared. I have the document. When we come into office'&mdash;this is him speaking before the last election&mdash;`I will place this bill before parliament. I will have the changes through forthwith.' He has had that bill now for three years. Where is it? This is the man who talks about the highest standards of integrity and probity in politics. That document&mdash;that industrial bill&mdash;sits in his back pocket. Is this a democracy or not? Are the people entitled to see that or not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one thing to say that you do not have your policies developed. It is one thing to say that your policies are only a broad, rough indication of what you intend to do. Everybody is in that situation once or twice in politics. It is an inevitable course of the political process. But to have the bill in your pocket for three years&mdash;an identifiable and analysable document&mdash;and it not appear! This man believes that that behaviour corresponds with the highest standards of integrity in politics. When we draw attention to that we are liars. When we draw attention to that we are fearmongers. When we draw attention to that we are trying to skate back into office on the backs of misleading and inaccurate portrayals of our political opponents. That is absolutely absurd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition had a lot else to say during his 20 minutes. He had to do a fair bit to fill in. I am going to go through one or two items of his speech. He said that this government is the government which has produced outstandingly high rates of youth unemployment. This standard of honesty apparently accords with the following figures. When he was in office there were 155,000 young people seeking full-time work in this country. There are now 88,000. Is that a lie? Is that presenting a truthful picture of the contemporary situation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the Leader of the Opposition went on and said&mdash;on our policies on interest rates in relation to the housing sector&mdash;that it is 50 per cent more expensive to service a mortgage now than when they were in office. The mortgage rate now is 10.5 per cent. That is if you are doing badly. If you go to one of the new superannuation backed outfits, you can get 9.4 per cent. If you go to one or two of the banks who are prepared to do smart deals, you can get 10 per cent or less. What was it when we came into office? It was 13 per cent. It never fell in that entire time that he was Treasurer, for that last term, below the level that it is now. That level was put in place to produce a sensible slowing of the economy. What did they used to do then? They used to cocktail them up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, who loves to portray himself in this place as a man of great integrity and all the rest of it, had this to say about the policies that the Leader of the Opposition condemns. This is what Mr Costello said on 27 July 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the system of credit controls that prevailed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is at the time when they were in office&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">banks refused to lend to borrowers who did not have a record of saving with them and refused to lend to borrowers who could not offer generous security against their loans. This made it harder for the lower income groups to compete for housing finance against the middle income groups and forced them to seek out housing finance through alternative and more costly forms of finance.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the position that applied before we got into office. Then he goes on and talks about Medicare. He opposed Medicare legislation put into this place twice&mdash;once during Whitlam's time and once under our time. Since that time on four or five separate occasions when the election has been around the place he has put forward the proposition that Medicare should be done over and pulled apart. He now says that he supports Medicare and he takes umbrage when we suggest that people perhaps ought not to believe him. They might actually be a bit suspicious about that. This is a man who is making an art form of lies in this election campaign&mdash;lies about where they stood, lies about where they now stand and lies about what their intentions are. Neither the Leader of the Opposition, nor the deputy who seconded the motion, who has been putting forward lies about his intentions on state policies, has the moral authority to move this motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Wednesday, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) asked me about the acoustics in the chamber galleries. Concerns have been expressed about the acoustics in the Senate and the House of Representatives public galleries for some time. A working group of officials was appointed to consider measures to improve the system. Following their report, changes were made to the chamber acoustics. Members may recall that this resulted in changes to both the microphones and the speakers. This took place in August 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A proposal to upgrade the acoustics in the public galleries was postponed because of the cost, estimated at $530,000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to raise the issue of taxation fraud within the computer industry. The fact of this fraud has been drawn to my attention by a constituent of mine who is a major retailer of computer equipment and who, over the past two years, has worked tirelessly to expose the fraud being perpetrated. On top of the myriad of pressures facing small business today, including excessive paperwork and high taxation, and taxation which involves very high compliance costs, computer retailers have an added pressure&mdash;some of their competitors are undercutting them by taxation fraud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some officials of the Australian Taxation Office have estimated that this fraud could be costing the Taxation Office as much as $140 million a year. However, there are legitimate operators who think the figure may go as high as $1 billion in lost revenue. Other Taxation Office officials do not feel that they have sufficient information to make an accurate estimate of the extent of the cost to revenue of this fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two distinct aspects of this fraud: the non-payment of taxation due, and the claiming of a rebate for wholesale sales tax which has not been paid. The first scam involves a company purchasing computers and computer equipment, such as printers, from wholesalers and claiming exemption of wholesale sales tax because they are selling directly to a retailer. The company then offers the computer or computer equipment for sale to a retailer or consumer at a particularly good price, claiming that tax has been paid. The invoice issued by the company includes a declaration that wholesale sales tax has been paid, but the Australian Taxation Office misses out on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that wholesale sales tax on computers and computer  equipment is currently at 22 per cent, the price difference between a computer on which wholesale sales tax has been paid and one on which it has not been paid is substantial. This is what is hurting the legitimate businesses and, ultimately, the wider community. It is hard to compete with someone who is offering an identical product at a very substantial and illegally obtained discount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second stage of the fraud occurs when the computer or computer equipment has been sold to customers who have an exemption from wholesale sales tax, such as farmers, churches and schools. The operator acting illegitimately then claims and receives a rebate on the wholesale sales tax from the tax office, even though tax was not paid in the first place. Currently, it appears that this problem is predominantly a Victorian one, but there is evidence of the fraud spreading interstate, particularly to New South Wales. The Australian Taxation Office was advised by computer retailers in Victoria of this problem almost two years ago, but retailers still feel that not enough is being done to protect legitimate businesses and prosecute the fraudulent ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am personally not satisfied that sufficient effective steps have been taken by the government to stop this fraud and to bring the offenders to justice. There has been considerable correspondence with the Treasurer, Mr Willis, the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, and the Commissioner for Taxation over the past 18 months. On 27 May, Mr Gear claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My constituent can rest assured that the necessary action is being taken to ensure that the correct amount of sales tax is paid.</PARA>
<PARA>However, it has been reported to me that the tax office told my constituent that it is beyond them `to police the fraud under current sales tax regulations'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both cannot be right, and the reported comment from the tax office to my constituent clearly contradicts the assurances given by the Assistant Treasurer that the necessary action was already being taken to ensure that the correct amount of sales tax was paid. The government must clarify this matter. If there is a need for further legislative action, then this should be clearly identified and action should be taken. If there is not, then it is up to the government to explain why the prosecution of this fraud is taking such a long period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legitimate operators have suggested that one needs only to pick up the classifieds section of any newspaper to find evidence of the fraud taking place. Such evidence includes computers and computer equipment being sold for less than the dealer cost plus the 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. It is quite impossible for legitimate businesses to compete on these terms, and there is a great deal of anxiety amongst the legitimate computer retailers that they are being undercut in this way for a very extended period of time in a way which is damaging to their business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated earlier, the tax office was first advised of this tax avoidance by various legitimate retailers two years ago, and it has taken some steps to act on the fraud. But legitimate retailers are wondering how long they have to continue competing against illegal operators. Some of the steps taken by the tax office include both top-down and bottom-up audits of the distribution chain. A bottom-up audit starts at the retail end of the chain, identifies those companies selling at the lowest prices and then traces back to their supplier. The tax office is also using the classified advertisements in newspapers to identify and then visit certain retailers as part of its bottom-up audit process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax office, I understand, is also monitoring all new applications of business registrations which refer to the computer industry instead of just a sample, which is common practice, and it is monitoring refund claims. Any application for registration that refers to the computer industry is checked to ensure that the person applying is actually a legitimate person from a legitimate address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that, in the last six months in Victoria, this process has identified between 20 and 30 applications which do not meet the criteria and which have been refused. The tax office is also refusing refunds if it suspects that wholesale sales tax has not been paid. On top of bogus refund claims in Victoria, the tax office has also identified shonky refund claims in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the tax office's strategy to combat the fraud is an education campaign aimed at educating the industry participants in their responsibilities. This campaign is designed to inform newly registered businesses of their responsibilities with regard to wholesale sales tax and rebates. It is based on the idea of industry self-regulation. However, the legitimate operators justly claim that the problem with tax avoidance and fraud is not a lack of knowledge amongst industry participants about their obligations. Some know their obligations full well, but the illegal operators make a conscious decision to flout the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of industry self-regulation, the tax office wants the large importers to ensure that their goods are sold only to legitimate operators. This aim may be somewhat naive as the importers are not necessarily in a position to identify legitimate operators and they cannot be held responsible for their products all the way down the distribution chain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax office also wants the legitimate businesses to educate the public about the tax avoidance issue, although customers are not inconvenienced by purchasing equipment on which wholesale sales tax has not been paid&mdash;in fact, they benefit from a lower price. It is being rather gullible to believe that people will happily pay a higher price for goods just so the tax office does not miss out on revenue, or that they will necessarily consider the legitimate operator who is abiding by the law and therefore has a more expensive product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By far the best way to ensure that legitimate operators are not bankrupted by unfair competition from illegal operators is to stop the illegal operators. This process has been unduly long. In Victoria, three cases have been referred to the Australian Federal Police under the Crimes Act; about 10 cases have been or are being prosecuted under the Taxation Administration Act; between 40 and 50 cases are being pursued through the courts in relation to wholesale sales tax and income tax returns; and multiple assessments have been issued which have resulted in debt collection activity in more than 70 cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax office obviously has identified that fraud in the computer retailing industry is a problem which needs to be addressed and it would certainly be distorting the situation to say that no action has been taken. However, the legitimate operators in the industry do not feel that enough is being done, and anything that is being done is taking an extraordinarily long time. The government has also given assurances that have not been borne out in this matter. Legitimate businesses have been competing against illegal operators for at least two years and are struggling to keep their businesses afloat in an unfavourable environment. The tax office must act and must be seen to be acting swiftly and competently to prevent fraud in the computer industry and to prosecute those who perpetrate fraud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to bring to the attention of the House two matters in this grievance debate. The first relates to issues concerning Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and, particularly, Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. I will then raise a matter, on behalf of a constituent, relating to the needs of people who are deaf or hearing impaired. That is a matter of national significance as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a deal of discussion in the past, and in matters presently before the House, relating to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and the proposed second airport at Badgerys Creek. When those matters were under discussion in the past I strongly supported, as did others, stronger curfew measures at Sydney airport and further steps being taken to ameliorate the detrimental effects of noise on residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that, amongst other things, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has agreed that noise monitors be placed around parts of the Parramatta electorate to help in the evaluation of the extent of the noise impact. Information will be provided to residents to inform them of the measures being taken to improve aviation operations and reduce noise impacts. This will also build a decent information and consulting base in relation to the Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to put on record in the House the fact that residents of western Sydney demand, just as vigorously as residents in any other part of Australia would, that there be the most comprehensive environmental study and analysis process in regard to all the operational aspects of Badgerys Creek airport. Residents of western Sydney&mdash;in particular, the residents I speak for in the Parramatta electorate&mdash;do not accept the sort of proposition that the Leader of the Opposition and member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has portrayed as the opposition's approach to what needs to be done to solve a small interest that he might have in his own constituency. I have here a copy of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Howard's Report</EMPHASIS>, a paper produced by the Leader of the Opposition for the residents of his electorate. Amongst other things, it says that the government has `failed to adequately develop the second airport at Badgerys Creek despite giving this undertaking prior to the new runway's construction'. He says that the additional funding does not ensure that Badgerys Creek will proceed without haste, and has numerous other comments on the record in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June this year the Leader of the Opposition was interviewed by Clive Robertson on 2GB. He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have you seen a map indicating who's going to be affected by aeroplanes flying twenty four hours a day to Badgerys Creek?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer from the Leader of the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I have seen all sorts of projections on that and they vary a bit according to who is making the projections but that obviously is a . . . is a debate and . . . that will have to be undertaken . . . a fight that'll have to be . . . be dealt with at the time when the . . . when . . . when the airport is opened but I have to deal with current realities and current problems and you have a grossly unfair situation at the present time&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>affecting a number of people in his electorate&mdash;under the flight path, no doubt. It is clear that much can be learnt from both the environmental impact process followed in respect of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport's new parallel runway and the new noise analysis approach. That airport's experience has shown the need for more comprehensive environmental impact work than was carried out in the mid-1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the Badgerys Creek airport, the key thing that residents are quite rightly saying is that they are not convinced, on the basis of the 1985 study, that all of the issues to do with air, water, noise, flight path planning&mdash;all of those aspects&mdash;have been properly addressed. We must take account of all the noise analysis work, all of the experience of airports here and around the world, the impact of changing aircraft design and the potential that has to change some of the strategies that were part of the study process, and the variables included in the study process for the original EIS on Badgerys Creek in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely critical, as residents are rightly saying, that those studies be comprehensive and that we go through a process of analysing all the new data and all the new material available to ensure that we have a strategic approach to the aviation needs of Sydney which will not only meet the aviation demands of the Sydney region over the next 50 years but will also satisfy the legitimate concerns of residents throughout the whole Sydney region. That includes making sure we have proper planning processes for Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, all too often, governments have not taken enough account of the environmental concerns of western Sydney. We have had a series of developments there which have not had the planning they should have had. It is particularly regrettable to note, since the original decision was made in 1985 that Badgerys Creek would be the site of the second Sydney airport, that there has been a deal of planning and development that should not have been allowed to occur in such proximity to the airport as to exacerbate the problems that may occur as a result of the airport. The conflict between development and airport operation could have been avoided had we had a state government in the latter part of the 1980s that was strongly committed to preventing that unwanted development, and had we had that state government using its planning powers, in conjunction with local government, to ensure land was not released for inappropriate activity over the last seven to 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we now need to do is ensure that Badgerys Creek airport is designed in a way that will make sure all of the operational aspects of airport development provide the absolute minimum of adverse impact on the community and on the environment of the region. The fact is that numerous studies undertaken by the CSIRO and others point to the substantial air pollution problem that occurs in that part of the Sydney region. As you move out towards that point, before you go to the Blue Mountains in Sydney, there is the great capacity there for much of the wind movement to generate extensive pollution across western Sydney. It can sit there for days just building up and becoming a substantial problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How you fit that into the problems relating to overall aviation demand is something again. It is a major challenge. What it needs is to take a step back and say, `These are very fundamental issues in 1995 that the community of western Sydney wants answers to.' They want to ensure that the inadequate planning processes of the past are not revisited on them. It is incumbent upon all of us in this parliament to say, `We will give those residents that commitment and that reassurance.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition says he believes that Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport should be closed to international traffic and that all international traffic should be diverted to Badgerys Creek. That is quite contrary to what was talked about in the 1985 EIS process and is inappropriate regarding the announcements made about Badgerys Creek and what role it will play in aviation in the Sydney region in terms of meeting Australian aviation requirements into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say most directly that it is absolutely crucial that all the environmental study work that is done on Badgerys Creek be most comprehensive and conscious of wide consultation with the residents of the region so we do not go through the process that the residents are in any sense duped by the poor planning and the poor processes that were followed in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, I want to raise one other matter. A constituent of mine has raised with me on a number of occasions the need to ensure that the million people in Australia who are deaf or have hearing impairment get access to captioning on news programs, particularly through the national news services on the ABC. The fact that there are a million people who have such a requirement is one that I think the nation should see as a reason to give this issue priority. I take the opportunity to urge the government to take steps to recognise that this is an important community service that should be provided, at not significant cost, in a way that gives quality of life to many people who have a hearing impairment but are seeking not a great deal from us other than the fact that they be able to see the national news service in the same way as everyone else does and get appropriate benefit from it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 July this year, my office was raided by officers of the Australian Federal Police. There has been ample publicity about the raid, so I do not intend to go into the details or circumstances of the raid in great detail, but I would like to put on record some matters about the raid which I feel need to be made. First and foremost, I would like to put it on the record that I and my staff have been cleared of all the allegations made against us. I knew all along that we would be cleared, for we did nothing wrong. The search warrant which prompted the raid on our office alleged certain conduct which neither I nor my staff were involved in. I am proud to say that the police have declared that my office&mdash;I and my staff&mdash;are totally innocent, as I knew would be the case. We played no part whatsoever in the alleged offences detailed in the search warrant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I put this on the record is that on the day of the raid, and days following, it was reported in the media that my office had been raided and that I and my staff were the subject of police interviews. My Labor opponent in the seat of Stirling even took out a full-page advertisement which included headlines such as `Cameron in police interview'. I honestly thought that she would have remembered the tenet that one is innocent until proven guilty rather than trying to sneakily give the impression of our being guilty of something we were not involved in. Despite our innocence, the implications were there and hurt us dearly. It was made worse when we were used by my opponent for cheap, nasty political point scoring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the course of these events, I read 27 reports&mdash;including front-page newspaper stories and virtual full-page stories&mdash;mentioning the raid on my office, not to mention the countless television and radio reports about it. When the Federal Police announced we were cleared, how much publicity was there? There was one story I read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;one story&mdash;plus a few small reports on television that night. That is all I have seen. I am still having people calling my office asking what the results of the raid were, whether we have been cleared and so on. So, for the record, we have been cleared. The news certainly is not as interesting for the media when people have done nothing wrong and are cleared as when they have been raided or arrested. While I am utterly delighted we have been cleared, the adverse media publicity did hurt, and it was a very stressful time for me, my staff and our families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the raid on my office, I sought legal assistance for me and my staff so we could get on with our jobs without being interfered with too much by the police inquiries. Our lawyer also, of course, was required to sit in during interviews for guidance. Today, I and my staff are paying off a bill totalling over $5,000 as a result of the raid. Approximately $3,500 was for counsel over the raid itself, and another $1,500 was spent on legal representations where I lodged a criminal defamation complaint to the Western Australian Police Force about comments by another person about the circumstances surrounding the raid, but which unfortunately was not further investigated, and which I did not further pursue because of the costs involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am lucky to have a generous lawyer who is allowing me to pay off the bill over time. Members would know that on our incomes we are lucky that we can survive comfortably, even with disruptions such as this. However, there are many people in the community who are not able to qualify for legal aid but also find it a struggle to afford legal representation when required, and this seriously compromises their ability to access justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to justice does appear to be a contradiction in terms. For example, in the 1994-95 financial year, there were 5,500 unsuccessful applications for legal aid in Western Australia, of which 3,200 satisfied the tests under current guidelines relating to income and assets, the merits of their cases and the type of case. A number of those people have passed through my office, seeking assistance, and to my absolute regret many were not successful in receiving the legal aid they sought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With limited funds, it is inevitable that funds can only go to the most worthy cases, even though those cases that are denied funding are still very worthy. Despite the best intentions of all governments, there will always be those who cannot afford legal assistance but are ineligible for legal aid and, as such, will be deprived of justice or have difficulty accessing it. Those who cannot access the legal representation they desire or require will be compromised by these limitations in their pursuit of justice or the defence of their innocence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I honestly believe that it is going to be a very long time before there will be equity before the law. It is also, I believe, middle income earners, Australia's forgotten people, who are the most disadvantaged. They neither have access to legal aid, nor earn the salaries of higher income earners to afford the representation they desire. It is the same in this area, as it is in many other forums of government, that this group is forgotten or ignored. They must be considered at all times in this regard and it is something parties of all political persuasions must continue to look at if we are to achieve our goal of a fair and just society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to think that the raid has been positive in one respect. It gave me the opportunity to view the working conditions of our federal law enforcement officers and, quite frankly, they are appalling. We are expecting these officers to chase the Mr Bigs of the criminal world, we are expecting them to catch the drug lords who are destroying the lives of so many young people, but the resources with which they must operate and the conditions for them to work under are utterly appalling. At the interview my staff were put in a room to wait. The room held a desk and a computer. The computer was ancient and the desk was tatty. This is the sort of equipment we are expecting our law enforcement officers to work with&mdash;and this is but one of many examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just recently we had a newspaper story stating that the Western Division&mdash;the Western Australian section of the Australian Federal Police&mdash;could not even afford to pay their rent. The officers of the AFP cannot be paid overtime so are only able to work between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. I could not be interviewed on one occasion because I was only available to them after 4 p.m. and they could not claim overtime. When you consider the criminals they must chase, this is appalling. How many criminals work between those hours? They don't, and we cannot expect the Federal Police to operate only between those hours either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Federal Police, certainly in Western Australia, need a major injection of funds or the fight against crime will not be won. We will be a laughing stock of the criminals, if the funds which the police are given to fight crime is just a pittance of the funds invested in crime by the people they are chasing. I appeal to the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) to visit the Western Division of the AFP and view their working conditions, and to give serious consideration to giving them an increase in funding. If no action is taken, the minister will be derelict in his duty of providing the resources to fight the criminals and protect the community from these maggots of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have huge sums of money spent on politicians, our offices and resources, but there is a more important group deserving of more funding; that is, our law enforcement officers. It is time the government gave them the resources they require. If they do not, they will be neglecting the responsibility of providing for one of society's most basic needs, that of safety. I implore the minister to review the funding to the Australian Federal Police because a failure to increase funding will simply see more kids' lives destroyed by these criminals. It is the duty of us all to work to ensure that funding is increased and that the perpetrators of crime are fought, and beaten, with adequate resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to a somewhat brighter matter, I have been fortunate enough over the past few months to have had working in my office here in Canberra another intern from the Australian national internships program. The young lady I have had working with me on this occasion is a young woman by the name of Helen Geard, from Tasmania. She has presented me with a report on family conferencing in Australia with the rather creative title <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crime sux! Change the roolz</EMPHASIS>. To give you an idea of what it is all about&mdash;I would urge members to take this up and study it closely&mdash;I read Helen's executive summary:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many underlying and complex factors contributing to the level of juvenile crime in Australia. Innovative strategies are required to address juvenile crime issues and the focus of this report is one such innovation&mdash;family conferencing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Family conferencing gives young offenders and victims the opportunity, in a supportive environment, to discuss important issues about an offence which has been committed. Conference participants aim to reach a consensus about a suitable course of action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The core process of family conferencing is similar across Australia, however, there are significant variations. Variations include; the term used to describe the process, where family conferencing is placed in the juvenile justice hierarchy and which organisation is responsible for its co-ordination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is too early to determine what is the most appropriate means of implementing family conferencing so innovation must be allowed to continue. Innovation requires commitment to discussion, implementation and evaluation from all stakeholders in family conferencing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report identifies two barriers to the continued success of family conferencing in Australia. The first barrier is the existing fragmented approach to the collection of data on juvenile crime. A comprehensive and integrated data collection strategy is required to assist in evaluating family conferences and the development of public policy. The second barrier is an apparent lack of communication between stakeholders across Australia preventing constructive dialogue and innovation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important first step in addressing the many issues, highlighted in this report, would be to hold a national conference on family conferencing.</PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate Helen on her excellent piece of work. I commend it to the House and ask members to read it as an important document on family conferencing in Australia. I seek leave to table the document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the grievance debate last week time ran out and I was interrupted, so I will begin by summarising what I was saying then, and then complete my remarks. I was speaking about international financial markets and I noted that there is widespread unease about the effectiveness with which international financial markets are operating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Volker commission in the United States argued last year that the swings in foreign exchange markets since floating was introduced has been a contributing cause to the low growth rates in industrialised countries during the last couple of decades. The apparent recent misalignment of major currencies appears to be a significant factor in the slowness of economic recovery in some countries. That is very clear at present in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The theory of rational speculative bubbles has increased understanding of this process; that is, the theory that market operators will go on acting as if currencies will go on rising or falling, whether or not that is justified by fundamentals. The constant smaller fluctuations of exchange rate add to risk and cost for business. The variability of financial flows increases the difficulty of monetary management, particularly in thin, emerging markets, and swings of confidence can cause massive movements of capital and exchange rates with  enormously damaging economic and social consequences, as Mexico so vividly demonstrated in the six months since last December. The collapse of Barings Bank adds to concern about the effectiveness of internal corporate and market supervision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These and related concerns have caused increased interest in means of reducing international financial market volatility and risk. A return to fixed exchange rates seems fanciful in foreseeable circumstances except on a regional basis, as in the European Union and perhaps, at some point in the future, between Australia and New Zealand. Proposals for macro-economic coordination between the G3&mdash;the US, Germany and Japan&mdash;with the aim of constraining currency movements to target zones would involve a degree of cooperation which none of the major countries is interested in at present. This has led to some growth of interest in the possibility of a small levy on foreign exchange transactions, as proposed by the Nobel laureate in economics, James Tobin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Peter Kenen proposed at a conference on the Tobin tax a few weeks ago what he described as a feasible plan for a small levy on foreign exchange transactions. An ad valorem tax would apply on the value of the transaction at a fixed rate and could be applied to all transactions&mdash;swap, futures and forward, as well as spot transactions&mdash;by banks and other dealers in the foreign exchange markets. Avoidance would be minimised by imposing a penalty tax rate to dealings with parties based in tax-free jurisdictions. So if someone was in the Cayman Islands, a penalty rate of, say, five times the tax rate could be charged on funds transferred from the Cayman Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Keeping the rate low would enhance viability. Kenen suggested a rate of 0.05 per cent. Discussion at the same conference tended towards a rate of 0.1 per cent. That is about double the current transaction cost. The tax would be collected at dealing sites because these sites are less readily moveable than settlement or booking sites. Dealing sites involve employees and dealing rooms. The tax would be collected by governments on a market basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a levy would generate considerable revenue for national governments and for the provision of global public goods. The Bank for International Settlements is in the process of gathering up-to-date data, but figures released by  the major markets suggest that the daily global turnover&mdash;that is, the turnover every day&mdash;now averages around $US1,300 billion. On the basis of plausible assumptions that a tax of 0.1 per cent would reduce the volume of transactions by about 20 per cent, Professor Jeffrey Frankel estimates that the tax would raise a total of about $US176 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major recipients would be the countries in which the volume of financial transactions is greater, which are, in descending order: the UK, which accounts for nearly a third of global transactions; the US; Japan; Singapore; Switzerland; Hong Kong; Germany; France; and Australia. We are ninth in this ordering of markets in which the most financial transactions occur. For other countries, the tax would be a valuable additional source of revenue, as it would be for all of those nine countries, including Australia. International agreement would be essential on the rate, the administration of the tax, and the extent to which revenue would be shared internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale for international revenue raising is now very strong. With growing globalisation, an increasing number of issues must be addressed, in part at least, on a global basis&mdash;issues such as reducing pollution, containing the spread of disease, peacekeeping, development cooperation, disaster relief and drug control, just to give some clear examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the reduction of market volatility and risk, all require a degree of international cooperation. Yet all remain inadequately addressed because of a combination of the free rider problem and the prisoners dilemma. Some of the solutions for these issues require the provision of international public goods. Public goods are services from which all benefit, whether or not they contribute to their cost. Examples of global public goods are: the prevention of war or terrorism; prevention of enlargement of the hole in the ozone layer; international postal, telecommunications and civil aviation organisational infrastructure; and international financial stability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although all people have an interest in these goods, they remain underprovided because everyone waits for everyone else to act, hoping for a free ride. While this interest is rational for each individual and country, all end up being worse off because of inaction which exacerbates the problems, which is the prisoners' dilemma. Compulsory comprehensive revenue collection to pay for global common goods is an essential way of coping with this form of market failure internationally as well as nationally. That is why we have national tax systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most relevant way in which a portion of the revenue from a Tobin tax could be used would be to improve the functioning of capital markets. Some of such activity is already under way: the work of the IMP to increase the accuracy and transparency of national economic and social data; the proposed doubling of the general arrangements to borrow, including by drawing in additional countries including Australia, which was discussed at the IMF meeting about two weeks ago in Washington; the proposal to establish currency stabilisation funds in developing countries and economies in transition, which is another IMF proposal which is on the table for discussion; the work of the Basle Committee and the Bank for International Settlements to recommend ways of improving prudential supervision. They are all the kinds of activities which could appropriately be paid for by the revenue from a Tobin tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several influential commentators, including Felix Rohatyn, who is one of the doyen of money market dealers in New York, and Fred Bergsten, who is one of the leaders of international financial economists in the US, have proposed the establishment of a new institution&mdash;a capital market supervisory authority. The World Bank is planning more technical assistance to developing countries, wanting to increase the efficiency and sophistication of their financial markets. All of these activities, and others related to them, would be entirely suitable uses for revenue from a Tobin tax, so too would broader activities aimed at strengthening international development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best functioning capital markets are worth little if the rest of the economy and society are in disarray. There are other important purposes that would be served by the tax, reducing the volume of international financial flows and reducing short-term speculation. As well as that, it is important to note that many countries are beginning to show an interest in this proposal and that study of it is under way. I am glad to say that our foreign minister is one of those who are supporting study of the idea. That study is an essential prelude to negotiations between countries which would be a necessary condition for the introduction of such a tax. </PARA>

The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Votes and Proceedings</EMPHASIS> for Wednesday last week recorded the tabling in the House of the texts of 24 treaties to which Australia is a party or in respect of which Australia is taking action to become a party. The 24 treaties dealt with subjects as diverse and as significant as civil aviation, reciprocal defence procurement, peaceful uses of nuclear energy, protection of investments, social security, safe containers, hazardous wastes, the Asian-Pacific postal union, oil pollution and international telecommunications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 24 treaties, four have already entered into force, including as long ago as April. In respect of a further three, the government indicated that it expected to formally accede to them during this current month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody in the House could have known the treaties were tabled except by reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Votes and Proceedings</EMPHASIS> on publication the following day. They were not tabled by presentation by the Speaker or a minister. They were tabled under the deemed tabling provision of standing order 319 which allows papers to be `delivered to the Clerk who shall cause them to be recorded in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Votes and Proceedings</EMPHASIS>. Papers so delivered to the Clerk shall be deemed to have been presented to the House on the day on which they are recorded in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Votes and Proceedings</EMPHASIS>.' This procedure being, for practical purposes, in secret, there is no provision for parliamentary debate on the tabling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Senate the procedure is a little more open but for practical purposes there is no effective debate there either. In the Senate the documents are tabled by presentation. There is provision for debate for 30 minutes in relation to all documents tabled in the Senate that day&mdash;the debate taking place just prior to the adjournment. On Wednesday, in addition to the 24 treaties, there were tabled in the Senate 16 other documents such as annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirty minutes is divided among six speakers, giving each five minutes. If the six speakers spoke only about the 24 treaties, each could devote 1 minute 15 seconds to each of four treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is clearly absurd. It occurs every six months in both Houses in the same manner. The six-month process itself is another absurdity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia there is currently widespread interest in treaties, how they are made and the obligations they create. By entering into a treaty, Australia undertakes internationally that it will enact any domestic legislation necessary to implement the treaty. Treaties plainly have significant consequences therefore for legislatures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding that consequence, Australia's entry into treaties does not involve the Australian parliament. The constitutional power to enter into treaties is virtually without qualification vested in the executive, meaning in effect the cabinet. Recently, control of the treaty making processes appears to have been steadily passing from the cabinet, the elected government, to the bureaucracy&mdash;cabinet considering only a portion of the treaties to which the executive commits Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The executive has no formal obligation to consult this parliament in relation to any treaty to which it proposes to commit Australia. Similarly, the executive has no formal obligation to consult state or territory governments or any person likely to be affected by implementation of the proposed treaty. There is a need for consultation by the executive arm of the federal government with the state and territory governments and interest groups and there is a need for the involvement of the parliament in order to achieve wider consultation and to make the executive more accountable. In recent months an increasing body of public opinion has called for more consultation, more accountability and a proper role for the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among proposals made by the coalition for institutional reform of the treaty making processes is a proposal to establish a joint house treaties committee in the parliament. Under a coalition government, this would be set up by resolutions of the two houses. It would be made up of senators and members and would be serviced by a permanent secretariat. The membership of the committee would be drawn from government, opposition and minor parties. As with many parliamentary committees, the chair would normally be of the government party and the deputy chair would usually be from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would not be feasible for the committee to monitor extended international negotiations of prospective conventions or to review a series of drafts of conventions produced at different negotiation phases. The best use of a parliamentary treaties committee would be for reviewing a proposed treaty only once, at a relatively late stage in its development either immediately prior to the anticipated signature or after signature and before ratification. The principal issue for the committee would be whether it would be in Australia's interest that the treaty be signed or ratified, as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless narrower terms of reference were agreed, the committee would seek to analyse the implications for Australia of adhering to a proposed convention. Submissions could be sought and obtained from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, from any line department involved in the subject matter of the treaty, from state and territory governments and from the public. In most cases the committee would take evidence in public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee would be expected to produce an inquiry report which would be tabled in the Senate and in this House. The report would usually be available to members of the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamental to the success or failure of the committee would be how the committee obtained references. The object of the committee could be defeated if its ability to undertake an inquiry was dependent upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs or another minister with an interest in the subject matter agreeing to refer a proposed treaty to the committee. Such a committee should be free, of its own motion, to inquire into any prospective treaty to which it is anticipated Australia will become a party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia becomes a party to scores of treaties each year. The proposed joint house committee could not conduct full public inquiries into all of them or even a small proportion of them. It is likely in fact that there would be little or no interest among members of the committee and other senators and members in reviewing most proposed treaties. Many treaties have bipartisan support. The committee's secretariat, however, would be able to do a brief preliminary analysis of each proposed convention for the purpose of recommending to the committee whether a more detailed inquiry was desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sensitive nature and national security implications of some treaties would require the committee to develop techniques to conduct more limited inquiries or confidential inquiries. Negotiation of bilateral treaties involves different considerations from negotiation of multilateral treaties or conventions relating to or emanating from international organisations. The committee would have to be conscious of bilateral sensitivities in any inquiry into a proposed bilateral convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the coalition's proposal that the committee's report be tabled in this House and in the Senate and that parliamentary time be reserved upon the tabling for speeches from members of the committee and others. I would expect that the unanimous recommendations of the committee would be accorded considerable weight by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, however, the recommendations run counter to the directions taken by Australian representatives in negotiations, it is certainly possible that there could be some embarrassment in international forums. But, given the importance of effective consultation and accountability, that is a price that should be paid. It is certainly preferable to the existing system under this government of five-minute speeches upon the tabling of batches of treaties, some of which are already in force, or the even more ridiculous secret tabling under the `deemed presentation' provisions of the standing orders of this House. In any event, if they knew in advance that any proposed treaty negotiated for Australia would be subject to parliamentary committee review, the negotiators would be in a position to minimise any potential embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just one of the coalition's proposals for reform of the treaty making process, but a parliamentary treaties committee alone would go a long way towards ensuring that the people of Australia have a say in the sorts of international obligations that are to bind them. This would eliminate the charade that took place in the Senate last Wednesday, the simultaneous secret tabling in this House, and would improve the quality of the democracy in which we live. A Howard coalition government would not take the arrogant, non-accountable approach taken by the Keating Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this is to introduce amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 and the Export Control Act 1982. The amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 will provide for the continuation of AWRAP's chemical residue monitoring and education programs which were to cease at the end of 1995. These activities will now be specific functions of AWRAP, although AWRAP will have no regulatory powers in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993, these activities were to be divested to industry before the end of 1995. However, the wool industry has been unable to identify a more effective and efficient means of undertaking residue monitoring and education programs than currently exists through AWRAP. Given the growing sensitivities in world markets to chemical residues, these amendments will allow the responsibility for the activities of residue monitoring and conducting of related education programs to remain with AWRAP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. The first of these reflects the government's commitment to ensuring that the rights of indigenous Australians are protected. To that end, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 will be amended to ensure that persons conducting offshore petroleum operations under that act will be required to respect and not unduly interfere with native title rights and interests when conducting those operations. This amendment provides an explicit legislative basis for the protection of native title rights and places these on a level footing with marine interests, such as navigation, fishing and conservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second proposed amendment to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 takes account of government responsibilities in regard to industrial health and safety. The offshore petroleum industry has an excellent safety record, despite being involved in potentially hazardous activities. The risks involved and the need for a sharp focus on safety was brought to light in 1988 when an explosion and fire on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Piper Alpha</EMPHASIS> platform in the North Sea claimed 167 lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lessons learned from that disaster have resulted in a new regulatory approach to petroleum safety in offshore Australia involving a move to objective based regulation. This provides companies and employees with the flexibility to manage safety in a way which best suits their specific circumstances. Such an approach recognises that managerial commitment and work system controls are crucial to safe operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment strengthens the ability to make safety regulations under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. In particular, it places a management focus on safety by specifically allowing for the making of regulations to ensure companies maintain management systems to secure the health and safety of personnel. The amendment also contains amendments to the act to remove an ambiguity to ensure that, where state or Northern Territory occupational health and safety legislation applies, the provisions contained in schedule 7 of the act do not apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment deals with a revised system of awarding offshore petroleum exploration permits under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, known as the guaranteed work program bidding system which was introduced almost 10 years ago by the government. A review of the system has revealed that the current provisions of the act are not adequate to fully support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed are designed to give legal force to the system to ensure that it is fully effective and adequately protects the rights of explorers. The guaranteed work program bidding system was introduced to enable soundly based work programs to be submitted and to avoid applicants overbidding for exploration permits and, if successful, not being able to fulfil their commitments. Over the past 10 years, the system has worked well and bidding rounds have been characterised by strong but realistic work program bids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the system, successful applicants are required to meet the work program for which they bid for the first three years of the term of the exploration permit&mdash;that is, the guaranteed component. If they elect to continue beyond the first three years, they must meet the work program in each of the three remaining years of the initial permit term. There is an option to surrender the permit on completion of the work in each of the last three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The holder of an exploration permit may apply to vary the work program conditions of the permit, if circumstances beyond their control occur. Exploration permits can be renewed for further five-year periods on the basis on an agreed work program, with the first three years being a guaranteed commitment. In accordance with the existing provisions of the act, 50 per cent of the blocks contained in the exploration permit must be relinquished at each renewal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system was introduced after consultation with the petroleum industry and with the state and Northern Territory governments who are involved with the Commonwealth in the joint administration of the act. The system continues to be strongly supported by the respective governments and, I am pleased to say, by industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also seek to validate past decisions on the award of permits under the system. This will add security to the system, a factor that is essential to the industry in view of the vast amount of high risk capital invested in exploration each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that it is necessary to ensure that the integrity of the bidding system is maintained so that the Australian offshore area remains an attractive place for explorers to invest and that a high level of exploration activity continues to enable the full extent of Australia's oil and gas resources to be properly assessed for the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment to the Export Control Act 1982 deals with the government announcement in the budget that a dedicated and independent monitoring unit would be established within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to implement new monitoring arrangements to monitor compliance with hardwood woodchip licence conditions. The costs of the monitoring arrangements are to be recovered from licensed hardwood woodchip exporters. To enable me to make regulations to recover the costs by way of licence fees, an amendment of the Export Control Act 1982 is necessary. The proposed amendment will enable me to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment arose out of a complaint from the state of the honourable member opposite, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), that in the wombat forests there were people not complying with conditions in the export licences. Once we had investigated that, we found there was little the Commonwealth could do to monitor those conditions, and that is how this arose. I am pleased to say too that this now has the support of industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the amendment is passed and royal assent is granted, I will be able to make ministerial orders to recover the costs of monitoring. It would be intended that licence fees for the monitoring be charged in connection with the 1996 hardwood woodchip export licences. I commend the amendments to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address those parts of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 relating to the proposed amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. The guaranteed work program bidding system for offshore petroleum exploration is an orderly bidding process which allows companies to bid for the right to explore for petroleum in specific areas or for permits in the offshore areas under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These permit areas are released by the federal government for bidding, when geophysical and other studies have indicated the possibility of petroleum being found in that area. Companies then submit bids, based on the nature of the exploration they wish to undertake and the amount they expect to spend. These bids are assessed by the federal government, and the right to explore in the permit area is then awarded to the bid which best agrees with the established criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This system has been widely supported by state and territory government and the industry at large for the 10 years of its operation. However, as the House has been advised by the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), a loophole has been discovered which potentially allows holders of exploration permits to surrender their permits at any time, without having completed their bid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has caused a crisis of confidence in the fairness of the bidding system, as it is vital to its success that winning companies be compelled to carry out the agreed work program with which they have won the bid. Otherwise, companies could win by padding out their bids by work they have no intention of completing and, ultimately, the attractiveness of Australia for petroleum exploration would be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition accepts that the amendments must be retrospective to December 1985 to minimise the possibility of legal challenges to previous permit awards. Our acceptance is firmly based on assurances from the government that there are no outstanding Administrative Appeal Tribunal cases or court cases which could be affected by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this uncertainty has remained, the government has delayed the awarding of permits on exceptionally attractive acreage released in November 1994, holding up an estimated $1 billion of investment. The coalition parties are concerned to see this uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible so that the process of awarding exploration acreage can be restarted and industry returned to normal operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further amendment addresses native title. Currently, under the provisions of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act, it is an offence for holders of petroleum exploration or production permits to interfere with navigation, fishing, conservation activities, mineral exploration and pipeline operations to a greater extent than is necessary for the reasonable exercise of the rights and obligations of the operator. This amendment will add native title rights to this list and provide a firm legislative basis for current administrative practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final group of amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act are non-controversial and will clarify and update the operation of the act as it relates to occupational health and safety. Safety is a critical issue in any industry but nowhere more so than in the offshore petroleum industry. I know from my own observations in visiting Bass Strait and North-West Shelf platforms that with a heightened risk comes an increased dedication to safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the more predictable activity associated with workplaces such as machine shops, petroleum exploration involves bursts of activity which require comprehensive safety planning and debriefing. Given the dangerous nature of the work, it is a tribute to all those involved that we have seen a significant improvement in safety in the petroleum industry over the last few years. From a level of 8.9 in 1990, lost time injury frequency rates for the industry have fallen to a creditable 5.8 in 1994. This compares very favourably with the total mining figure in the year 1993-94 of 27. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This excellent result is reflected throughout the industry and, as an example, Esso employees recently completed 10 million work hours without a lost time injury. As a consequence, Esso now concentrates on eradicating all injuries and focuses on 24-hour safety for its employees, modifying behaviour away from the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further outstanding example of safe working practices is the heliport operation at Longford which serves the Bass Strait platforms and rigs; it recently won an award for not having had a lost time injury in 20 years of operation. The crews carry about 150,000 passengers a year, with 116 scheduled flights per week, often in hazardous and inhospitable conditions. I congratulate them on their outstanding achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One worrying element in regard to safety issues in offshore operations is the extent to which restrictive industrial relations practices are hampering the development of a safety culture. At present, the operator of a vessel has no say in the choice of crew since crews are selected using a roster established by the union. With different personnel for each trip, experience in safe operation under petroleum exploration conditions is not being accumulated. There is a break in the continuity of those in the workplace. Without the ability to retain and encourage good performers, safety issues are much harder to address effectively. These restrictive practices have no place in an industry which has to be internationally competitive to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take the wider view. Statistics from Worksafe Australia record 455 deaths in the Australian workplace over 1991-92, while over 140,000 workers suffered some kind of job related injury requiring compensation. Given that many near misses will occur with every lost time injury reported, Australia has some distance to go in integrating a safe culture into the workplace. Our safety record reveals something disturbing about our society, especially as it is easier and less costly to implement effective safety programs than to cope with the aftermath of an accident. Nevertheless, there are trends towards improving safety in the offshore petroleum industry which the coalition wholeheartedly encourages. We support the amendments before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said, on 27 July and 8 August this year, as part of private visits to Geneva and Washington, I inspected the existing chancery and the site proposed for the new chancery in Geneva, and the Australian Embassy in Washington. The visit to Geneva convinced me of the need for the work and gave me an appreciation of the suitability of the site for the chancery. With the Washington visit, it was helpful to have discussions with the ambassador and members of his staff. I am sure the ambassador will regret not being able to see the work of the committee come to fruition. Without these inspections, the committee&mdash;you would appreciate this, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, as you are a member of the committee&mdash;would have been fully reliant on brief videos which showed aerial and ground shots of the Geneva site and existing unsatisfactory accommodation in Washington.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee again draws attention to its inability to travel overseas to inspect existing premises and proposed sites and to have discussions with planners, designers and staff. The committee regards this as a completely unsatisfactory situation. As I said recently in this House, it would save the taxpayer of Australia a considerable amount of money. The committee has concluded that the proposed design of the Geneva chancery will provide a building suited to the task of providing accommodation for the three ambassadors of the four Australian missions in Geneva. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A feature of the chancery complex is the inclusion of a separate annex which will house the New Zealand mission. The Australian and New Zealand missions will be separated by a landscaped courtyard, which will hopefully include a symbolic water feature&mdash;which, I suppose, indicates the water separating the two countries. The committee believes the concept of shared diplomatic premises with nations such as New Zealand could be extended to other projects when opportunities arise, and the committee has recommended this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One rather disturbing aspect of our representation in Geneva is the very high cost of leasing residential accommodation for two of the three ambassadors and their Australian based staff. It may surprise the House to know that it costs Australian taxpayers almost $2 million a year to provide residential accommodation for our diplomats in Geneva. The committee has therefore recommended that a review of existing residential accommodation is required, aimed at reducing or eliminating the financially burdensome recurrent expenditure associated with leasing residential accommodation. The design concept submitted to the committee has not reached the detailed design stage, and the committee has recommended that consultations with the Community and Public Sector Union should continue during the detailed design phase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report I have tabled relates to the proposal by the Overseas Property Group to refurbish the Australian Embassy in Washington to a standard suitable for efficient and effective operation. The proposal entails a staged program of internal refurbishment to provide tenancy conditions which meet the requirements of occupational health and safety, the replacement of outdated and obsolete equipment and the provision of office accommodation which meets current data and communications needs. Physical security protection will also be improved. The estimated cost of the proposal when referred to the committee was $16 million at November 1994 prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original building which houses the Australian Embassy in Washington was constructed in 1969 and is well located at 1601 Massachusetts Avenue and was extended in 1976. But the building is now 25 years old and has not undergone a major refurbishment since it was constructed. Considering that the industry norm is to refurbish office buildings after 25 years, it is not unexpected that the Washington embassy now has many deficiencies. Quite frankly, it is looking its age, especially the interior. It lacks suitable fire protection and fire egress, and major building services have reached the end of their design life and require replacement. In addition, office layouts are inefficient. The provision for current and future technology is inadequate. Physical security protection is also deficient. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Employment Services Act 1994 established the case management system and established the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA, as an independent statutory authority responsible for regulating the case management system. The bill would make machinery changes consequential to the implementation of changed case management arrangements for certain part-time and seasonal workers. It would also streamline certain administrative procedures relating to CES notification requirements and allow the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA, to obtain goods and services by using a credit card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill would provide for consequential amendments arising from proposed changes to the Social Security Act 1991 that would amalgamate jobsearch allowance and newstart allowance. It would also amend the Social Security Act to provide for the National Convenor of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to delegate his or her powers under the Employment Services Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the bill would allow for inclusion in determinations made under the act provisions relating to resetting unemployment registration to zero of particular clients who decline to continue to participate in the case management system. This is in line with announcements made in the 1995-96 budget and already implemented. The new arrangements were introduced for part-time and seasonal workers because they have substantial and recent work force experience and may not require, or in some instances want, the level of assistance provided under case management. The bill would seek to make consequential amendments to that part of the act that defines job compact eligibility for the purposes  of  a  case  management  activity agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill would streamline requirements on the CES to notify and interview a person after they become a participant in the case management system. The existing provisions of the  Employment Services Act 1994 require two separate contacts to be made, the first being when a person becomes a participant in the case management system and the second when the person is to be referred to a case manager. The bill would require the CES to make a single contact with the job seeker for the purpose of notifying participant status and for requesting the job seeker to attend or take part in an interview. Under the bill, notification that a person is a participant in the case management system will be made when the CES calls the job seeker in for an interview and considers that a referral can be made to a case manager within 24 days of a referral interview taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, ESRA is unable to use government credit card facilities because the act does not provide for it to borrow money. To overcome the administrative inconvenience this causes, the bill would provide for ESRA to obtain goods and services on credit by the use of a credit card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequential amendments are also required to the act following changes to the Social Security Act 1991 to allow for the amalgamation of jobsearch and newstart allowance with effect from 20 September 1996.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is apart from the parliamentary secretary. This indicates how embarrassed the government is over the need to introduce legislation at this stage to fix up some of the minor errors of Working Nation. Working Nation has become a monumental embarrassment to the government, is regarded around the country as simply a device to hide unemployed people from the statistics in an attempt to make the government look good in the run-up to the election campaign and offers far too little real practical assistance to unemployed people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this bill corrects a number of oversights and mistakes in Working Nation. The Employment Services Act 1994 established the case management system and also established the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA, as an independent statutory authority responsible for regulating the case management system. This bill makes machinery changes arising from changed case management arrangements for certain part-time and seasonal workers. It would also streamline certain administrative procedures relating to the CES notification requirements and allow ESRA to obtain goods and services by using a credit card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also allows for consequential amendments arising from proposed changes to the Social Security Act 1991 that would amalgamate the jobsearch allowance and the newstart allowance. It would also amend the Social Security Act 1991 to provide for the National Convenor of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to delegate his or her powers under the Employment Services Act 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the CES is required to notify a person that they have become a participant in the case management system as soon as practicable after they have become a participant. The reason why this provision was put in initially was to bump up the numbers apparently in the case management system as early as possible so that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) could appear in this House and tell us how many people were already participating in case management. The embarrassing thing about this particular proposal was that it meant there were many more people participating in case management than there were case managers able to handle them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there were many instances of participants&mdash;the word `participants' has to have inverted commas around it in this particular context&mdash;who found it very difficult to ever get to meet their case manager. They were sitting around for prolonged periods waiting for that opportunity. Although the government was telling them and the nation that they were participating in case management, it was not apparent to them that they were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This meant that many people received two notices: one when they became a participant in the system, and the government could boast that they were in the system, but they could not be referred to a case manager; and another notice when they were referred to a case manager. It no longer serves the government's purpose to have these two notices. So we are told that on the basis of administrative efficiency we will now move back to one notice. The two-notice system served its original political purpose. Now we will move back to a one-notice system. From the point of view of unemployed people, this is a much more sensible arrangement. But it highlights&mdash;and let me underline this&mdash;the political design inherent in the original procedures established by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also relates to job compact eligibility for certain seasonal and part-time workers. This is also to be amended in the bill. The definitions of persons eligible for the job compact is amended to include the requirement that, in addition to having been in receipt of the jobsearch, newstart or youth training allowance for a period of 18 months, a person must also have been registered with the CES for a period of 18 months. This is apparently to take account of persons who have had their CES registration date reset to zero. I understand that the reason for this is that the system was, by the way in which it was defined, drawing into the case management system people who were not appropriately case managed in their own eyes&mdash;indeed, they aimed to be part-time or casual workers&mdash;and otherwise were registered with the CES and formally eligible for case management but it was really not appropriate that case management be provided to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the provisions in this bill, when seasonal and part-time workers elect not to participate in case management the period of 18 months registration required to be eligible under the proposed amendments would be taken to commence from the time of that election for seasonal workers and for part-time workers after they have completed at least 13 weeks of work. Provision is made in the bill to save those persons eligible for the job compact for the purposes of the section before the proposed amendments and to save determinations under existing section 39, subsection 14, that were in effect before the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes provision for ESRA to purchase goods and services on credit from any person by the use of a credit card. The present ESRA does not have the power to borrow money and, accordingly, cannot use government credit facilities. I have to say that one may well wonder what is the rationale for the provision of this credit card to ESRA, the Employment Services Regulatory Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think most Australians, and certainly all Victorians, would feel a twinge of unease when they realise that this credit card is to be provided to Joan Kirner and her committee. Of course, Mrs Kirner is the person who virtually bankrupted the state of Victoria by her excessive borrowing. Now she is to be provided with a credit card to borrow on behalf of ESRA. I am sure a close watch will be kept on her proclivities by the members of the ESRA board. The opposition will certainly be keeping a very close watch on the way in which this card is used. It will be very closely monitored. The measures in the bill, according to the government, are not expected to have a significant financial impact. I hope that applies also to the credit card arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that case management was highlighted in the white paper Working Nation as a means of tackling long-term unemployment through the jobs compact. It was to involve one-on-one service provided by a case manager to a job seeker unemployed for more than 12 months or considered to be at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Case managers were to work with the job seeker to negotiate a case management activity agreement which sets out the course of action tailored to the needs of the job seeker and agreed between the job seeker and the case manager. The object is to assist the job seeker to obtain and retain lasting employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case managers provide counselling and jobsearch assistance supported by access to programs, vocational training, relevant remedial courses in literacy, numeracy or English language skills or community based experience or subsidised employment. The case management activity agreement requires a job compact client to accept any offer of suitable paid work or any placement under new work opportunities or the new enterprise incentive scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the case management system is not even now operating in an entirely satisfactory way in many parts of Australia. As I talk to unemployed people in different states, I find that it is still the case that many long-term unemployed people who have been assigned a case manager have not actually met their case manager. The one-on-one case management of the original Employment Services Act has not really materialised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say, and this has certainly been confirmed in discussions I have had with officials in the department at the area level&mdash;I suppose that is the correct area description&mdash;that the concept of case management has really undergone some change since the initial white paper was brought down. Instead, today there are case managers with loads of over 200 cases. I have heard figures far higher than that. It is obviously the case that a case manager with such a load as that is in no position to provide the kind and quality of case management required which those with long experience of assisting the long-term unemployed know is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many contract case managers&mdash;that is, private providers of case management&mdash;face problems in getting started. Despite being advised that their tenders were successful, they waited for quite some time to be connected to the departmental computer system, which is essential to their effective operation. In addition, some contracted case managers feel that they have been given the hard cases&mdash;people who have been unemployed for four or five years or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a belief, which I think should be dispelled by the government in its response in this debate, from the point of view of the contracted case managers that perhaps the department is retaining `easier' clients to ensure that their commencement and outcome figures are optimised. Certainly there is a problem that has been identified by many in Working Nation. I remember it was quite recently identified by the national executive director of skillshare, David Thompson, that the incentives in the system are such as to encourage officers of the department to place people in programs rather than to focus on the employment outcomes of the people who are being case managed, because the officer is assessed much more by the placement in a program, even if this does not lead to an employment outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many case managers have demonstrated effectiveness in helping unemployed people, and I certainly am not critical of the efforts and the enthusiasm of many of the officers of the CES in struggling to make the system work. I am sure in many cases there have been successful outcomes. But there is no doubt that they are being hamstrung by the bureaucratic nature of the Working Nation package and its great complexity and by the fact that innovative and successful solutions which may vary from region to region, or even within regions, are constantly having to be altered or abandoned to fit the model of help laid down by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DEET has basically determined how unemployed people are to be helped. Unless you are prepared to help unemployed people in the way determined by the department, your scheme is most unlikely to receive departmental funding. Some comment can be made about that by way of exception because there is another tendency at present&mdash;that is, for funds to be made available almost on a `no questions asked' basis. The department is still finding that this massive pot of money has to be spent. Of course, the government is very keen that as much of it as possible be spent before the election campaign. The more people who are placed in subsidised employment of a project kind, as is the classic case, the better the unemployment statistics will look. Unfortunately, this reflects the fact that there is a great concern, I regret to say, on the part of the minister with the statistics rather than with actually making sure that unemployed people are receiving the employment opportunities that they so desperately need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the case management system, the House should note that the Auditor-General has recently questioned the effectiveness of the operation of the case management system. The Auditor-General's report revealed that there were significant weaknesses in the system which, according to the Auditor-General, must be `quickly remedied' as they reduce the capacity of the system to provide assistance to long-term unemployed people. The criticism made by many was borne out by the report&mdash;that many unemployed people had very tenuous links with their case manager or were not receiving effective assistance at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report found that almost one-third of people being case managed&mdash;that is, those who were surveyed by the Audit Office&mdash;did not believe that their contact with the CES was useful, despite visits or personal contact. Thirty-nine per cent of clients did not realise that they had a return to work plan, which is a key element of case management, and 43 per cent of clients said they were no more motivated to find work after starting case management. At the time the case management system was introduced the coalition stated that it would welcome the introduction of competition to case management if it meant that a genuine choice in employment case management would be made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsibility for ensuring that that level playing field, as the government described it, comes into existence falls on the Employment Services Regulatory Authority&mdash;that is, ESRA. It is obvious that there are a number of issues which have arisen in the implementation of the system which certainly have needed the attention of any authority determined to ensure that the system of contracted case management operates efficiently and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has focused on the importance of taking a holistic approach to the long-term unemployed and has made a commitment to establish community employment organisations comprising local, state and federal officers and community and business representatives to revitalise community based employment programs and to assist unemployed people. These structures will enable the regional character of unemployment to be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case management has been in place for almost one year and is still facing significant problems. Industrial difficulties abounded when the system was introduced. The CES is still facing increased pressure on its resources and contracted case managers have complained that there are insufficient funds to provide an adequate level of case management for those who need it. The Public Sector Union has trenchantly criticised the government for the way case management has been implemented. In September 1994&mdash;just over a year ago&mdash;the Community and Public Sector Union stated quite clearly what was happening in the department. The union's newsletter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result of this is the current chaos as DEET management try to frantically rearrange staffing resources to meet Case Management targets, as well as fudge statistics to make it look as though targets are being met.</PARA>
<PARA>These quite serious charges by the union were never, and never have been, effectively answered by the government. Nor were these charges confined to one point in time. A year later, in the newsletter published by the union for September this year, the charges were effectively repeated. The union states in its September 1995 newsletter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have clear evidence that much of Working Nation isn't working.</PARA>
<PARA>This piece of legislation before the House, to which no government member other than the parliamentary secretary has deigned to speak, is designed to correct some of those problems with the implementation of Working Nation, although not the most serious problems. The most serious problems remain to be addressed in other ways. But the problems have been there. They have been known to all those charged with the responsibility of implementing the program and they have been pointed out on numerous occasions by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister claims that if only we will tell him what the problems are he will correct them. Over the last year we have told the minister at great length what the problems are. Virtually every change that has been made to Working Nation of any significance is a change which has been recommended to the government by the opposition. The opposition has been extremely constructive in this matter because we have been greatly disturbed at the fact that effective help to many unemployed people has been denied over the last year because of the design flaws and the blundering which have accompanied the introduction of Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy has caused quite a lot of difficulty to many unemployed people. One of its greatest problems has been that it has actually fed the pool of people who are long-term unemployed. Working Nation has created long-term unemployment. I identified that problem to the minister and the government well over a year ago. I have done this because of a very serious blunder made at the time. That blunder was to deny assistance to many unemployed people until they were long-term unemployed. Many were sitting around waiting to be long-term unemployed so they could qualify for assistance under the Working Nation guidelines. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the government is claiming great success in terms of its employment record. It claims that it has created over 600,000 jobs since the last election and that Working Nation is on target to achieve unemployment of around five per cent by the year 2000-01. The facts show that the reality is quite different from the impression that these claims are designed to create. The recession we had to have destroyed 337,300 jobs. Net job creation is about half the number claimed by the government&mdash;net being once you take away from the 600,000 or so jobs, the jobs that were destroyed. These net new jobs have been insufficient to meet the demand from the growing number of people in the work force. In other words, over the last five years job creation has not kept up with the growth in the work force. As a result of that, over the last five years unemployment has gone up from 6.2 to 8.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Job creation has now slowed down to zero. The last ABS labour force figures showed that employment had fallen, despite the enormous number of subsidised jobs which the government is creating monthly through spending taxpayers' money under Working Nation. The rate of subsidised job creation is now running at somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 a month. In June it was 20,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are presently about 85,000 people in subsidised jobs in the work force. Imagine if the department was not creating 20,000 subsidised jobs a month; what would job growth have been last month when, even according to the ABS labour force statistics, employment fell by 15,000. The department is trying to hold up the employment scene by balloons at the moment. Of course, the public is well aware of the fraud in these figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of this daunts the government because its objective is to distract people's attention from the record and to focus their attention on some mythical future. So, in superannuation, the Prime Minister asks us to look ahead to 2020 and that people on very low incomes today should be immensely grateful to him because he has promised them some benefit in 2020. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 2040, as the member for Ballarat reminds me. It has gone out a very long way. Of course, in the employment area, we are asked not to think about the unemployment rate&mdash;one of the highest in the industrialised world&mdash;but to think about what it might be in five years time, and that might be five per cent, according to the government. Our view is that the growth in the economy at the moment and the likely growth is nowhere near enough to get unemployment down to five per cent by the end of the decade. Even if it were five per cent by the end of the decade, youth unemployment, which is typically three times the adult rate, would still be about 15 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that virtually no responsible commentator believes for a moment that the government is correct when it makes these claims. The claims are, in a literal sense of the word, incredible&mdash;unbelievable. The rate of economic growth over the year to the end of June 1995 was 3.7 per cent. The government has been saying that if we can sustain economic growth at about four per cent, we can get unemployment down. The Prime Minister has stated that if you can't get four per cent, you might as well give the game away. The government has not been able to get four per cent. It is falling well short of that, and well short of its predictions.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget paper forecast for economic growth for 1995-96 is 3.75 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many commentators simply do not share the government's rose-coloured view of economic growth. Professor John Quiggan, speaking at the Jobs for Young Australians conference in Adelaide, had this to say about growth and unemployment:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latest forecast from Access Economics suggests jobs growth will remain strong enough to see the unemployment rate bottom at around 7.9 per cent in mid-1996 before it begins to climb back towards 9 per cent in 1997. . .

<PARA>Saul Eslake, the Chief Economist with the ANZ Bank, said it would be `quite difficult' to get unemployment below seven per cent by the end of the decade, even if the economy grew at a sustainable pace of around four per cent a year. Tim Colebatch, on 8 September 1995, wrote:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join my colleague the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) on this issue because I believe it is important not only to this parliament and those who are associated with this place but also to our community in Australia, and certainly the community within Cowan which currently is suffering high unemployment&mdash;in particular, high youth unemployment and its associated social problems. I note with interest, though, on the speakers list for the Employment Services Amendment Bill 1995 that no-one from the government is prepared to speak on this issue. Maybe that confirms that they think it is not a particular problem to be addressed by our nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1994, I addressed the House on the issue of unemployment in terms of it being a continuing challenge for the people of Australia. I must take back those words as they are now proven to be little more than a gross underestimation of reality. Unemployment in Australia has gone far beyond being a challenge; it has actually become a real and acceptable alternative to employment of any kind.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also an endemic social problem which is worsening week by week as our unemployment numbers seem to soar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an attitudinal trap from which long-term unemployed can see no reasonable escape. It is an expectation of the future of many of our young school leavers and young people in general, which is sad to see in a country like Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an indictment that is of our Labor government. What an appalling situation. What a tragic cycle of total dependency and deprivation for the people of Australia, all created by a short-sighted, short-term thinking and short on talent Labor government. The Employment Services Amendment Bill that we are debating today is similarly short on content and planning, short on underlying strategy and very short on the basis for equity among our very needy unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs two simple things in relation to unemployment. The first is obvious&mdash;that is, jobs for all people who want to work, jobs created through business confidence and support. Secondly, we need a dynamic attitude shift among Australians, to once again believe that to earn a living through gainful employment and work, and long-term employment, is a real alternative to accepting government handouts. This brings a bundle of associated social concerns, such as the ability to earn a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. But this is not under question at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the long-term unemployed are either lazy or unwilling to work; far from it. I want to make that point clear and not open to any misinterpretation by anyone. However, I suspect that some have lost the will to work. They are thoroughly despondent and morally shattered by the whole experience of being unemployed. Having had an extended period of unemployment when I was quite young, after transferring from Victoria to Western Australia, I can say that it can be quite a shattering experience to be out of work for a long period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term unemployed are also feeling totally rejected and dejected by the total lack of government support and initiative in helping them get back to work. I suspect that they are totally sick to their back teeth of green papers, white papers, discussion papers, standing committees, sitting committees, surveys, action plans, et cetera, that all talk about issues and initiatives but do not really give Joe and Jackie Average a job, or a job that they want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill being discussed today does not address this fundamental of creating jobs. The essence of this bill, as I see it, is the issue of case management, a concept which I find most unappealing in both the term itself and its activity base. I am appalled that unemployed persons are referred to as `cases'. They are not medical problems and they are not part of student case studies. They are quite simply people who want to work. They are in need of a job&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the term&mdash;management&mdash;relegates the unemployed to the ranks of the unthinking, those people who need to be managed and controlled&mdash;like unruly children, for instance. The fact is that all they need is employment guidance, a helping hand and a lead in the right direction. They do not need to be forced into any situation. They do not need to be managed as you would manage livestock in a yard. They need help, assistance, guidance and support&mdash;not management. For goodness sake! Let us not take away the last vestiges of self-esteem from the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case management, as it was termed, was highlighted in the white paper Working Nation as a means of tackling long-term unemployment through the so-called jobs compact. This was to involve a one on one service and liaison between a case manager and job seeker who has been unemployed for more than 12 months or considered to be at risk of being long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the role of case manager, as created in the bill, was to be suited to the likes of a superman or a superwoman. This superperson has to provide counselling and jobsearch allowance, vocational training, relevant remedial courses in literacy, numeracy or English language skills and opportunities for community based work experience or subsidised employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This superperson charged with being all things to all clients also has to cope with written reports, face-to-face contact, networking and community liaison, as well as keeping up to date with changing work practices, changing legislation and changing roles within their own field, and who knows what other changes. It is little wonder that the system is not fully operational in many parts of Australia at present. It is little wonder that many long-term unemployed are yet to even meet their assigned case managers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be reasonable. Some case managers have workloads of 200 cases. They really cannot be expected to cope with demands of this magnitude. The one on one case management concept, as in the original employment services bill, has not materialised. Many of these people are contracted to positions through a tendering arrangement. They should reasonably expect support from the government in undertaking their roles. However, even after being accepted as contractors&mdash;all signed, sealed and delivered&mdash;they have to wait for some time just to be connected to the departmental CES computer system, a pivotal element in their successful operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a growing realisation that these case management contractors had been given preferential treatment. That statement is rather misleading. Case managers were allocated what I would describe as negative preferential treatment, if there is such a term. It appears that these case managers were given a fair case load but that those cases were mainly considered to be the hard core unemployed or by definition those who had been looking for work for some four or five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CES staffers, on the other hand, took on the issues and the cases of the shorter term unemployed. The reality is that the case managers were hamstrung: they were denied access to information, denied a balanced case load and denied real and meaningful liaison with the department by the very bureaucratic nature of the Working Nation package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are not my thoughts alone. As a business manager of considerable success, these problems could have been envisaged by even the most naive operator in business. To have these issues arise with the support, planning, so-called wisdom and overall endorsement of a so-called professional&mdash;the minister himself&mdash;is unforgivable, misleading and reeks of incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My views are backed also by the Auditor-General, who recently questioned the effectiveness of case management and the system under which it operates. The report revealed significant weaknesses in the system, recommended the necessity for quick remedies and highlighted the tenuous link between the jobless and case managers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My views are supported yet again by the facts&mdash;a few hard, cold, non-negotiable figures. Firstly, one-third of case managers do not believe that their contracts with the CES were in any way useful. Secondly, 39 per cent of clients did not even realise that they had to return to work, which is a key element of case management. Thirdly, a staggering 43 per cent of clients said they were no more motivated to find work even with the assistance of a case manager. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we really got? We have a scheme that is poorly named and demeaning to those involved, a scheme that the CES does not totally support and which is open to bias and rorts, a scheme that the unemployed do not understand, a scheme that has no proven results and a scheme condemned by the Auditor-General himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will leave it to my colleagues to point out the many problems with this bill&mdash;and believe me they are many and varied. Without doubt, there are few other pieces of legislation that have been so badly prepared, badly developed, poorly trialled and poorly evaluated as this one. Once again I am forced to say that the essence of the bill is sound, but thanks to the ineptitude of the Labor government it is impractical in its implementation and not its intent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment cannot, and must not, be seen as an island issue&mdash;an issue in isolation from all others. It is an issue which touches on so many different areas and the only approach to unemployment must be addressed with broad thinking, long-term strategies and sound business acumen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been brought to my attention that the government of Singapore, through a company operating in Western Australia, may be flouting not only our immigration laws but also our industrial legislation. As a result, I believe the Singaporean government is actively denying Australians work in their own country while insidiously putting in place draconian industrial practices transplanted from that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 February 1988, the government of Singapore and the government of Australia entered into discussions regarding the establishment of a republic of Singapore air force flying training school in Australia. The government of Singapore and the RSAF were finding their existing arrangements were not allowing them to attain the flying hours that their trainee pilots required primarily because of restrictions on airspace in and around their existing flying training areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment and subsequent operation of a RSAF flying training school in Australia would be beneficial to the RSAF's training scheme as the airspace that would be available under such an arrangement would be far less restrictive and far less crowded. The benefits to Australia were perceived to be primarily economic in the form of providing employment to a depressed aviation industry, a boost to Australian aviation maintenance facilities already established and a strengthening of ties between the two allies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 February 1988, a status of forces agreement was drawn up between the two governments. This SOFA covered, among other things, the guidelines regarding personnel and equipment transfers from Singapore to Australia and the terms and conditions that would apply during the established period of the new RSAF flying training school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 March 1993 a memorandum of understanding between the two governments was drawn up and signed. This MOU laid out specific guidelines, dates, personnel numbers, local industry involvement and local employment requirements for the establishment and subsequent operation of the RSAF training school at RAAF base Pearce in Bullsbrook north of Perth near my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By September 1993 the initial advance deployment of 16 RSAF aircraft was stationed at RAAF base Pearce, housed temporarily in RAAF hangars while the new RSAF facilities were being constructed. These facilities were to be fully funded during design, construction and ongoing maintenance as per the MOU. At about this time, Australian aviation maintenance personnel recruitment began. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By January-February 1994, recruitment of Australian personnel had increased but not to a sufficient degree to compensate for the resignation rate of the initial Australian employees. In May 1994 the new RSAF facilities were completed and the RSAF flying training school moved into its new complex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The activities of the Singaporean government, through its company in Australia, have been questionable. I have received numerous complaints about alleged breaches of the memorandum of understanding in the original agreement. It has been alleged that, amongst other things, from September 1993, when recruitment of Australian aviation maintenance personnel began, it was even then apparent that paragraph 5, titled `Scope', of the MOU was being contravened. Although the MOU specifically stated that, excepting for Australian contractor support personnel, only RSAF personnel would be engaged by the GOS with the RSAF flight training school, there are a considerable number of Singaporean civil aviation maintenance workers as part of the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These personnel were and still are employees of Singapore Aerospace Engineering, the parent company that wholly owns the Australian registered contractor, Perth Aerospace Engineering. As the number of aviation personnel increased, the Australians were told that it was only an interim arrangement and that, as recruitment increased, so the civilians would be sent back and Australians would take over their various roles. Alongside both the civilian Singaporean and the Australian contractor personnel was a large contingent of uniformed RSAF maintenance personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By January-February 1994, recruitment of Australian personnel had increased but not to a sufficient degree to compensate the resignation rate of the initial Australian employees. Terms and conditions of employment, and the contrast between what Australians were led to believe would happen and what in actual fact was happening, were the primary reasons for the resignation rate, which was exceeding 50 per cent. There were also grave concerns in the areas of safety, maintenance standards, wage rates, hours of duty and shift arrangements, and a general feeling that the Australian personnel were compromised in their professionalism and future prospects for employment in the Australian aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1994 it became apparent that uniformed RSAF personnel were returning to Singapore, not the civilian SAE personnel, who still remain employed by PAE&mdash;as I have said, an Australian company&mdash;in Australia under GOS travel orders. It also became apparent that PAE management was actively encouraging RSAF maintenance personnel to discharge from the RSAF with the promise of guaranteed employment with PAE in Australia at the RSAF flying training school. This is a blatant abuse of the originally agreed position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, a situation now exists where an Australian company is employing overseas labour to the detriment of the Australian work force by apparently rorting the SOFA agreement between the two countries. PAE is bringing in civilian Singaporeans without any sort of visas but using government of Singapore travel orders, a situation reserved for the use of transfer of military personnel between the two countries.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, as you would appreciate, I am a very strong supporter of representative and accountable administration of Australia's major sporting codes. I do not believe, for instance, that unrepresentative, unaccountable media barons, like Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Packer, should control rugby league or rugby union in this country. You can imagine my delight upon reading the recommendations of the recent Temby report on the administration of thoroughbred racing in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommends that the Australian Jockey Club be stripped of its governing powers and that a thoroughbred racing council be established. It is very important for an industry with a net revenue of $350 million, for an industry that brings employment and so much entertainment to so many people in New South Wales, to have effective and representative administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me provide an example of how unrepresentative the AJC has been in its long history. This is something I am sure the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) will be interested in, being a long and strong fighter for the rights of women in Australia. There has not been a female committee member of the AJC in its history, going way back into the last century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small punters, small owners and small trainers in the thoroughbred racing industry have never been effectively represented by the Australian Jockey Club. In my own part of Sydney, in the south-west, we only need to look at the Warwick Farm racecourse to understand that it is very much the poor cousin of racing in the Sydney metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two AJC controlled tracks in Sydney: Randwick and Warwick Farm. Warwick Farm, well out of proportion with its share of punters and population in Sydney, has a low number of Saturday meetings, a low number of feature races and in fact has always been stripped of the quality racing in the Sydney area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No comparison could be made with the capital facilities. The Randwick racecourse in east Sydney is given Rolls Royce treatment and capital funding by the AJC whereas Warwick Farm receives nowhere near the same amount of capital funding and capital support. One only needs to look at the residential address of the majority of the committee members of the AJC to understand they much prefer racing at Randwick, in the eastern suburbs near the lower north shore of Sydney, than where the people live and where the people are moving&mdash;that is, the Warwick Farm racecourse near my electorate in the south-west of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would urge the Carr government, in the establishment of the thoroughbred racing council, to make sure that the interests of punters, trainers and racing lovers in the greater western Sydney region are represented on that particular council. I would urge the council and the Carr government's racing minister, Richard Face, to make sure that the south-west of Sydney, through Warwick Farm, and the west of Sydney, through Rosehill racecourse, have a fair share of the Saturday meetings, the feature races and the quality thoroughbred racing to match the population share and the interest in this tremendous sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not surprised to read that the chairman of the AJC, Bob Charley, is upset about the idea of club busting, the idea of breaking down the elitist control the AJC has exercised over racing in New South Wales for many decades. I was not surprised to read at all that Bob Charley has mentioned that four Labor governments tried it in the past. Mr Charley would not be too keen on Labor governments doing anything. I hope this Carr Labor government in New South Wales, unlike its predecessors, actually introduces representative and accountable administration of horse racing in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very hard to have confidence in the current circumstances in the AJC. We have already read about the spread of race fixing, money laundering and illegal betting. We have all seen the loss of confidence in the racing industry following the evidence revealed in the so-called jockey tapes. We have all seen the sort of administration for which the AJC has becomes notorious&mdash;that is, decisions made behind closed doors, a secretive decision making process which by no criteria can be judged to be in the best interests of the racing industry and racing supporters in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Carr government needs to go ahead with this new representative body. It needs to make sure that in representation the west and south-west of Sydney are not overlooked.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The recent opening of the 2.1 kilometre extension of the Plenty Road light rail from the Bundoora shopping centre, McLeans Road, to McKimmies Road and the Bundoora RMIT campus was an extremely positive outcome for students of RMIT and for residents and future residents in the estates along Plenty Road, an achievement celebrated by a community fair at RMIT. It was an extremely positive outcome for the Better Cities program. It was a personal triumph for Brian Howe, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, and the architect of the Better Cities program. However, had you read the local paper the week before the opening, you might have been forgiven for thinking that the federal government had nothing to do with the project. The publicity department of the Victorian Public Transport Corporation had worked overtime on the publicity, announcing details of the opening without bothering to mention from where the money had come, which was of course the building better cities program&mdash;to the tune of some $12.6 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the opening, which was carried out jointly by Brian Howe and the state Minister for Public Transport, Alan Brown, much was said along the lines that the extension was a shining example of effective cooperation between the federal and state governments. The Minister for Housing and Regional Development himself said that local, state and federal government had worked together on this model project. The minister was being modest and undervaluing his role and the federal government's role in this project. It may well have finished up a model of intergovernmental cooperation. It quite easily could have ended up a model of intergovernment uncooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that when the original announcement was made in December 1991, the project included the extension of the light rail approximately three kilometres to Childs Road, Mill Park. Not only would this have serviced the rapidly growing Bundoora campuses of RMIT but also the extra kilometre would have brought the tram to the 30,000 residents living in the suburb of Mill Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The housing development in Mill Park has the types of problems that the Better Cities program was designed to address, such as a gross lack of public infrastructure. It is a great shame that the tram was not extended, as originally announced. The reason it was not extended to Mill Park is simple: Jeffrey `Glib' Kennett was elected Premier of Victoria. The change of government in 1992 brought a change of Better Cities priorities. Initially the Victorian Liberal government wanted to drop this extension altogether. It was only pressure from the federal government that put the extension, at least as far as RMIT, back on the rails. Without the pressure from the federal government and the funds from the federal government the light rail would not have moved one centimetre further along Plenty Road past the previous terminus at McLeans Road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable that this attitude of the state government makes it unlikely, if not impossible, for the remainder of the project to be considered in the next round of Better Cities funding, which with a cooperative outlook it might well have been. What this episode demonstrates is that Commonwealth-state relations are tenuous, require the vigilance of the Commonwealth and need overhaul&mdash;but not the sort of overhaul envisaged by the coalition. As is clear from the recent comments of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Mr Costello), the coalition if it achieved government is intent on handing over large areas of Commonwealth authority to the states. This has all been heard before&mdash;from Fraser, from Hewson, and now from the Howard-Costello biumvirate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often in my electorate I have had to comment, `The Commonwealth to the rescue again,' as the federal government covers for deficiencies left by the state government. The coalition would take away this capacity by vandalising the national government and effectively fracturing the nation. Mr Kennett may have some supporters, including some in this House, as well as his numerous detractors, but I am sure that even his staunchest admirers would cringe at the thought of him being given more authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new tram terminus at RMIT Bundoora is adjacent to another Better Cities project, the redevelopment of surplus institutional land at Janefield for housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the cooperation that has taken place thus far between some state government departments, the Urban Land Authority, local government and a range of community agencies led by the federally funded Family Resource Centre in Thomastown. For the Janefield development not to simply replay the mistakes of the past there must be a whole-of-government approach, especially at the state level. While the signs are encouraging, there is evidence that at least one state department will not fully participate in a proper planning process. An official of the Department of School Education, a notorious department under Mr Kennett, told a public meeting, `They do not take the advice of anybody on where they build their schools,' when it was suggested that as part of the proposed development of the Janefield land an alternative site for the Bundoora Primary School might be considered. This attitude is of great concern. Better Cities is about avoiding these mistakes, not replicating them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise an issue which I have raised previously in this House. It is to do with the Calder Highway between Melbourne and Bendigo and Mildura being included in the national highway system. I raised this issue in 1990, in 1991, in 1992, in 1993, in 1994 and in 1995 on many occasions. The federal government has refused on every occasion to come to the aid of the city of Bendigo and all of the townships along the route of that highway to upgrade it to four lanes and include it in the national highway system. I have spoken to the Victorian state government and they have at last cooperated with us. It took a change of government to achieve this; the former Labor government, the Cain-Kirner government, would not. We have developed a total strategy for the whole length of the Calder Highway from the bay to the Murray at Mildura. It will include a four-lane divided freeway between Melbourne and Kyneton, a four-lane divided highway between Kyneton and Bendigo and a reservation suitable for conversion to freeway standard in the longer term and a two-lane highway north of Bendigo with driving conditions appropriate for a major state highway with adequate overtaking opportunities and full access for efficient freight vehicles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the Calder Highway is very important in Victoria and in Australia's future. It is a strategic link in Victoria's rural highway network, carrying high volumes of freight transport, business travel and personal travel between Melbourne and the major provincial city of Bendigo, and moderate volumes of traffic between Bendigo, Mildura and New South Wales and, to a lesser extent, South Australia through to the Sturt Highway, which is part of the national highway system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I raise it again is that the Minister for Roads and Ports, the Hon. Bill Baxter, released this strategy just last week. It is a very good strategy. I note the acceptance by the member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) of the fact that it is a good strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy requires $36 million per annum. The states are going to come up with some money. Of every cent that you spend on fuel, 50 per cent of that money goes on fuel excise, levied by the federal government. What does it return? It returns less than a third of that money to Victoria's roads and it is collecting all of this money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) indicate that it is time the states did something. Here is an opportunity for the federal government to do something. The state government has come up with a strategy. It is prepared to do its part and put its dollars in. If the Commonwealth government is not prepared to accept that the Calder Highway should be part of the national highway system, it has to accept the responsibility for funding part of this highway. Country users are major contributors, through fuel excise, to the federal coffers. The member for McEwen would acknowledge that fact. He is probably trying to get some of the roads in his area upgraded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is the opportunity for the federal government to provide some additional funds to the Calder Highway, which is a most important road in Australia&mdash;leading to all of that primary production area north of Melbourne, providing ready access to the ports and airports and providing access for personal travel and tourism. It is an important link and it is one on which the federal government has done some work&mdash;I acknowledge that fact&mdash;but little enough, bearing in mind the massive amount of fuel excise it collects on every litre of fuel. Fifty per cent of all fuel costs is fuel excise&mdash;another tax on the motorist&mdash;and a minimum amount of that money is returned for road funding. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I again bring to the House a black book&mdash;the book of Victorian horror stories&mdash;and from that I extract yet another story of misery and horror being imposed on the Victorian people by the conservatives of this country. When we talk about lies, deceit and policies, we know what they in Victoria stand for and what the conservatives will do in federal government because we see it daily in Victoria. This is an extract from today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> entitled `Tehan's miserable cuts'. It concerns the second national mental health report on funding for the mentally ill in Victoria. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated 140,000 Victorians with a serious mental illness can be glad the police Special Operations Group is to swap its guns for capsicum sprays and Y-bars.</PARA>
<PARA>In Victoria, unfortunately, they get shot too often by an uncaring government. The 1995 report has found that Victoria was the only state in Australia to cut its mental health service&mdash;the only state. We know what it has done to the public hospital system. For every dollar the Commonwealth puts in, Victoria takes $1 out of the system. So mental health, of course, is a major concern now in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did the Victorian government make a massive 5.8 per cent cut to its mental health spending in 1994 but, as the report points out, incredibly it siphoned off into general revenue half of the $30 million saved in the widespread closure of beds in separate psychiatric hospitals. This is the conservative policy. This is what we expect out of a Howard government and this is what we know it will do. It does not care very much for people with mental illness, and we see that in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health further found that specialist mental health services are failing to provide any treatment for a staggering half of those Victorians with a serious mental illness. You hear a few mutters on the other side, but if the members from Victoria making the little grunts over there were so concerned with what is happening in Victoria, then we would hear them in this House talking about the lies and deceit that occur in Victoria. We would hear them standing up for ordinary Victorians who are suffering so greatly under this uncaring and unsympathetic Liberal-National Party government. As I have pointed out, the reality is that, if the funding cuts keep going, it is only a question of time in Victoria before country public hospitals will close. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that in Victoria you die waiting for an ambulance&mdash;unfortunately, a not uncommon occurrence now in Victoria. Unfortunately, it is all too common. Just ask Mrs Chong, whose husband died very recently. She was an intelligent, articulate woman, who knew her husband suffered from heart illness and heart disease. When he had a heart attack, she picked up the phone and she requested a MICA ambulance&mdash;a highly specialised group of people with defibrillators who can handle heart attacks. That is why these ambulances exist in Victoria. Mrs Chong knew what the problem of her husband was. She knew he had a heart attack; she knew he needed a MICA ambulance. But no MICA ambulance turned up. After some 20 minutes wait, a normal service arrived, and Mrs Chong said, `I want a MICA ambulance.' It took another 20-odd minutes before a MICA ambulance turned up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Mr Chong died. He died because of a Liberal-National Party government that does not care about people and that is slashing so deeply into the health budget in Victoria that it is now common practice for ordinary Victorians to die for lack of services. Mental health patients are ignored on the streets of Melbourne. One unfortunate lady was recently shot by the police because there was no service, no help and no assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government are not satisfied with the savage cuts they have already made. Each year in Victoria there is now a further 1.5 per cent efficiency dividend&mdash;that is what they call it, an efficiency dividend. That is Liberal-National Party code for further cuts. So all of the services have to keep finding, up to the year 2000, an additional 1.5 per cent cut per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the conservatives on the other side of the House are really concerned about lies and deceit, they should ask Jeffrey Kennett why in 1992 he did not tell the Victorian people what he intended to do to them. They should ask him what he intended to do to the public hospitals and to the mental health system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The following amended answer replaces the answer (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, 20 September 1995, page 1430), previously supplied to the honourable member:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) Yes, the Department of Human Services and Health provides data to consultants from time to time which can include people with medical qualifications. In some cases medical practitioners may be engaged individually. In other cases they may be part of a team. In some cases a large consultancy organisation may use medical practitioners incidentally. The Department does not know to what extent any of these medical practitioners are currently practising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Data provided to consultants may take two basic forms:  aggregate data, where individual patient and provider details cannot be identified, and data which relates to individual providers or patients although patient data is usually deidentified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Yes, the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) has engaged consultants since 1993 who are registered medical practitioners and such consultants do have access to patient servicing and provider data held by the HIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) Yes, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has engaged consultants who are practising medical practitioners in the specified period but neither the Institute nor consultants employed by the Institute have access to patient servicing or provider data held by the HIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(a) Where consultants (and others, such as researchers) employed by the Department of Human Services and Health are provided with individual identifying data, the data is provided under the provisions of Section 130 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (or Section 135 of the National Health Act 1953 if the data is covered by that Act). As such, consultants are bound by the relevant secrecy provisions and they may only use the data for the purpose provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standard consultancy contract used by the Department also invests intellectual property with the Department and requires consultants to notify the Department if there is any risk of a conflict of interest in relation to the work being undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(b) The appointment of consultants by the HIC is made by resolution of the Commission and each consultant is required to enter into a formal contract with the HIC. This contract requires the consultant to give the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i)an acknowledgment that he or she understands the secrecy provisions in Section 130 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 and Section 135A of the National Health Act 1953 and will not make use of such information otherwise than for the purpose of his/her duties under the Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii)an acknowledgment that all information will be protected against loss or unauthorised access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii)at the conclusion of each consultancy all information held by the consultant will be returned to the Department/ Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iv)an acknowledgment that he/she will advise of any conflict or risk of conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HIC is able to monitor computer access should the need arise. This is done in cases of suspected misuse of data. The HIC is also developing an artificial neural network to detect improper access to data.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not clear what is meant by private advantage. To some extent any consultant (or researcher) may gain a potential saleable benefit from doing work which improves skill and knowledge and which demonstrates success. This is similar to a surgeon working for a public hospital who, through conducting operations and using the facilities of the hospital, may gain skills which contribute to the surgeon being able to earn private income in the future by treating private patients. This incidental commercial benefit from conducting consultancy work is a natural event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential use of insider trading type information from the Medicare Benefits database to improve the income of medical practitioner would appear to be limited. Published Medicare statistics already provide information such as bulk billing rates, fees charged and aggregate item use.</PARA>

The New South Wales Department of Industrial Relations has consulted with the Workcover Authority with a view to achieving compliance with the Convention. A submission is currently being prepared for consideration by the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations in order to further progress the matter. Tasmania has identified two relatively minor compliance problems, which are expected to be overcome when the Workplace Health and Safety Bill 1995 is passed into legislation.</PARA>
