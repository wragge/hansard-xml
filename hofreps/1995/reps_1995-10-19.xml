<PARA>I indicate that the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Bill is designed to prevent double dipping by people who receive Medicare or nursing home benefits which are subsequently covered by a compensation payment. The government's amendments aim to simplify the administrative obligations of insurers and other compensation payers. They deal with concerns raised by organisations such as the Insurance Council of Australia and the Law Society of New South Wales about the bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's amendments introduce bulk payment arrangements which will come into effect 18 months after the legislation commences. This will allow compensation payers to avoid the need to report on individual claims as they arise by providing bulk payments on an agreed basis with the Health Insurance Commission. The 18-month delay is crucial to enable the Health Insurance Commission to collect sufficient data upon which to base an agreement price for individual insurers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also simplify the administrative requirements and reduce delays by removing the obligation for insurers to provide a full copy of the judgment or settlement; by removing the requirement to notify of a forthcoming hearing; by deeming that, in most cases, a current notice of past benefits can also be regarded as a notice of charge; and by allowing parties to settle claims provided the compensable person has been informed that he or she may have a debt to the Commonwealth for Medicare or nursing home benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government amendments address all of the concerns identified by the insurance industry and the legal profession.

<PARA>Commonwealth funding for the vocational education and training sector for the years 1995 and 1996 has already been appropriated under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. This bill would provide for the supplementation to these amounts in line with price movements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1996 the Commonwealth's funding would enable further growth in the number of student places, continue the level of infrastructure support in real terms and enable an expansion in funding for national projects in areas of strategic national importance. The bill would also appropriate funding for 1997, in accordance with the Commonwealth's undertaking in the heads of government agreement that established the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA, to provide triennial funding for the vocational education and training sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1997 also sees further evidence of the government's commitment to expansion of the vocational education and training sector through the provision of a further $70 million in growth funds. This would bring the total growth funding provided by the Commonwealth government over the period 1993 to 1997 to $1.55 billion. The Commonwealth, in turn, expects states and territories to honour their undertakings in the ANTA agreement, including maintaining their own effort in vocational education and training. The additional growth funding is expected to result in an additional 35,000 student places being made available in 1997. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, very much so. I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1995. This bill provides the House with an opportunity to allocate resources to vocational education and training, while the debate provides us with the opportunity to reflect on the government's record in this area. I will not spend too much time on the detail of the bill, given that the minister has already done so in his second reading speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important to understand that the bill provides increases of $9.469 million in 1995 and $9.192 million in 1996 to the current legislated amounts. The bill also provides a total of $949.88 million in general funding, which includes $22.7 million for the off-the-job training to ANTA in 1997 under Working Nation. The coalition is strongly committed to the vocational education and training sector, we fully support the allocation of resources to the sector and, as such, we support the bill before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With substantial sums invested in the vocational education and training area, it is appropriate to look at what results this expenditure is achieving. Simply, the government's training initiatives are failing. They are failing because they are not leading to full-time long-term jobs. They are failing because they are not adequately meeting the needs of business and industry. More importantly, they are failing because they have not provided Australia's young people and all who undertake training with a sense of hope for the future. These are the underlying themes of recent speeches, reports and articles about the government's vocational education and training agenda. The common theme running through all of these is that the government's training program is not delivering the jobs or the expertise promised, nor is it directed to any specific aims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that all of us in this House would agree that only through a world-class training system will Australia be able to have a world-class work force which would not only lead our nation but also the region to the next century. Regrettably, Australia in 1995 is not well placed to take this lead. This view was confirmed by the release early this year of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enterprising Nation</EMPHASIS>, or the Karpin report as it has become known. What this report showed was that all the rhetoric and chest beating of the last 12 years about opening up Australian markets and making us internationally competitive was just that&mdash;rhetoric and hot air. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although Australians still have a relatively high standard of living, commentators and policy makers have become increasingly concerned that the nation's economy is not growing as fast as those of many of our neighbours. As a result, Australia is sliding down the league table of economic performance, most recently being overtaken by Singapore and Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a disturbing conclusion, given that the future of Australian business does or rather should lie in the Asian region. The reason our businesses cannot be competitive is that under the policies of this government our training system is not competitive. Again, Karpin states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it appears incontrovertible that Australian enterprises, training providers and educational institutions are not moving quickly enough to address the new paradigm of management. Many of their counterparts overseas, and especially the leaders in the various fields of industry and education, are changing more rapidly and more extensively, and will be better prepared for the next century.</PARA>
<PARA>Research undertaken by the Australian National Training Authority quite clearly shows that Australia's international competitiveness is related to work skills. The warning bells are well and truly ringing. If we do not make our training system and institutions world's best, then Australia will fall further behind the Asian region. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in his address to the ANTA conference on 10 February this year, announced:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we need to ensure that training reform keeps up with the astonishing rate of industrial change. We therefore need to ensure that training reform is industry driven.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's comments are an admission that this is not happening. Yet on May 3 last year, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training told the House, `TAFE places are meeting business needs.' This is not what the Karpin report found nor apparently does it accord with the Prime Minister's view of things. The Karpin report concluded that there was a demonstrable need for `aims to make TAFE more responsive to enterprise needs'. The views expressed by Professor Karpin about the state of the vocational system in Australia have since been seconded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August of this year, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia released the outcomes of its review of the national training reform agenda. The review made it clear that the government's training reform failures far outweigh its successes. The only person in reality assuming escape is the minister who, in an extraordinary answer to a dorothy dixer to the House on 30 August 1995, said, `CEDA is overwhelmingly supportive of the directions of the reforms.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what did the review really find? What, for example, did it say about the national training reform agenda? The report found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Progress has been slow and the new training structures are too bureaucratic, overly complex and irrelevant&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat, irrelevant&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to the needs of many enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA>Does the minister seriously expect us to believe that this conclusion is again, to repeat his words, `overwhelmingly supportive of the government's initiatives'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the report's conclusion that the national training reform agenda suffers from a lack of industry involvement&mdash;another overwhelmingly supportive comment. Perhaps the minister thinks the report's finding of a lack of emphasis on quality in assessment issues is yet another overwhelmingly supportive comment. How overwhelmingly supportive, you may ask, Mr Speaker, is the report's call for a need to improve links between vocational education and general training? Far from being overwhelmingly supportive of the government's reforms, the report is overwhelmingly critical of the increasingly bureaucratic way the reforms have been dealt with, the reforms' complexity and their irrelevancy. The fact that the minister thinks such blatant criticism is supportive shows just how out of touch he and his government have become. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the ANTA address I quoted from previously, the Prime Minister unhesitatingly stated that `We are doing well'&mdash;we are doing well, he said. So, at the same time as the reports of Karpin and CEDA were finding that the training system in Australia was becoming increasingly complex, bureaucratic and irrelevant to the needs of industry, the Prime Minister believed that `We are doing well.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Prime Minister did not stop there. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No-one should doubt our resolve or our belief that the direction we are taking is the right one.</PARA>
<PARA>`Our belief that the direction we are taking is the right one', the Prime Minister said. This sits uncomfortably with his previous comments that to date the training reform was not industry driven. What is quite clear is that, in fact, the government's direction is increasingly becoming the wrong one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is tragic that the conclusions reached by Professor Karpin and the CEDA report are nothing new. If anything, they are only an update on what was found a year earlier. In June 1994 a report was released by Dr Vince FitzGerald of the Allen Consulting Group, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Successful reform</EMPHASIS>. The FitzGerald report, as it became known, was a review of the implementation of the training reforms and was commissioned by ANTA. The report's conclusions were just as damning as those previously stated. Not only did the report find that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is unclear, under the reforms, what the objectives of public funding of training are . . . </PARA>
<PARA>but it also went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the National Training Reform Agenda is seen as for the benefit of government and unions.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: not for the benefit of Australia's young people, nor business, nor industry, nor any other forms of production&mdash;but rather for `the benefit of government and unions'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report further found that there is no overall national strategy; training objectives are imprecise or obscure; reforms are driven from the top down; it is a high cost system with a lack of attention to the demand side; information is lacking about what clients actually want; there is an inadequate knowledge about the small business market; there are administrative and organisational weaknesses at government level producing conceptual confusion; and there is a failure to integrate services, and a focus on inputs instead of outputs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the report found the system is overly bureaucratic, has no national mechanism for implementation and has no assessment process. These conclusions were reached eight months after the Prime Minister arrogantly declared that our belief in the direction we are taking `is the right one'. If the Prime Minister and the minister seriously believe that the findings of FitzGerald, Karpin and CEDA, just to name a few, show that we are doing well, then Australia is in serious trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps, however, on the Prime Minister's benchmarks, he may be right, because let us remember that this is the Prime Minister who believes that this is as good as it gets. He is right&mdash;this is as good as it gets under the present government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government would very much like to be measured on their outcomes and the results of their 12 years in office. Despite Working Nation, ANTA, the national training reform agenda and the billions of dollars poured into vocational eduction and training, the result is disappointing to say the least. The CEDA report&mdash;the same report Minister Free said was overwhelmingly supportive&mdash;concluded, `As a proportion of the labour force, the number of apprentices and trainees is now at its lowest point in a quarter of a century.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard a huff and puff from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training then. The minister, in an answer to another dorothy dixer in this House yesterday, repeated claims that the government's ongoing apprenticeship program has been a success and, relative to other times, a great success. The reality is&mdash;I will not go into this today, but I will do so at a later stage&mdash;that the minister is quite clearly unaware of the CEDA report and the significant implications for Australia's apprentices and trainees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will repeat the conclusion found in the CEDA report: `As a proportion of the labour force, the number of apprentices and trainees is now at its lowest point in a quarter of a century.' That is adequate proof, I would have thought, that the direction the Prime Minister is so proud of is not, to use his words, `the right one', nor, again to use his words, `doing well'. This apparently is the pinnacle of 12 years of Labor's policies and the legacy our children and young people have been left with by a totally out of touch government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crux of the problem is that the government are so deluded by their own rhetoric that ministers do not want to listen to any views other than their own. They do not want to listen to the industry, the opposition, those in the training sector or, it appears, even their own members. It is totally unacceptable that, in a time of record youth unemployment, there is a real chance that Australia is facing a skills shortage. The member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), who is the chair of the caucus social justice committee, alluded to this in an interview on radio station 2CN on 5 May 1994 when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two-thirds of Australians work in the services sector and many of those work in human services like education and health, and care for the aged, the young, the environment and the arts. And all of those areas desperately need additional people working in them because there are lots of unmet needs. They're not being enabled do so because there isn't adequate funding for TAFEs. And that's because, in large part, the Commonwealth has cut funds available to the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA>Before the minister goes feral on that statement by one of his own people, I admit that the government may challenge the validity of the latter part of that claim. Here is a prominent government member disillusioned with his own party and obviously disillusioned with the direction the government is taking in this area&mdash;and that member is not alone in his views. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 28 April last year entitled `Here it comes again&mdash;a skills shortage', Philip Cornford warned that there was a very real chance Australian employers would start to import labour. Cornford wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . because of a dismal training record, employers have had no difficulty doing this in the past. The future looks like being no different.</PARA>
<PARA>Basically, Cornford was warning us that unless our training system was at a higher standard Australia would continue to have high levels of unemployment, as other workers were brought in to do the jobs which could and should be carried out by Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cornford is not alone in his assessment of a potential skills shortage. In March this year, the Institution of Engineers Australia, warned that the number of new engineering positions available threatens to outstrip supply. Dr Michael Dack, from the institution, has warned:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia will probably go back to the position of not being able to graduate enough engineers to meet the need.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely our priorities should be filling Australian jobs with  Australians who are fully qualified through a vibrant and industry relevant training system. What we need to do is widen the field in which vocational education and training can take place. Perhaps if we had greater opportunities to provide this training we would not have young people feeling that the situation for them is hopeless. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has lost sight of the fact that training programs should be designed not only to make people more employable but, more importantly, to make them employed. This cannot occur if vocational education and training does not prepare participants for the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That theme has been reiterated by the Business Council of Australia in its `Achieving Australia 2010' 1994 scorecard. The findings are just as damning as those in the reports I previously mentioned. The BCA found that `training reform is yet to make a major contribution to improved training performance'. The report by the BCA reiterated other all too familiar messages, such as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . outcomes from education are not well matched to the future cultural, intellectual and skills challenges facing Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The report acknowledges that the government has attempted to make some progress in this area. Although acknowledging that a major effort is planned in vocational education and training to achieve world-class education and training targets by the year 2001, the report is quick to note that `the quality of the implementation of the reforms has been a negative factor'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the achievements in vocational education and training are not at the level Australia needs, and there is very little evidence that the government will make the changes necessary to bring about a world-class training system. It seems that every time you pick up a publication regarding the training portfolio, the same concerns are repeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Training Authority's economic newsletter for the September quarter 1995 detailed the outcomes of a series of industry workshops in agriculture, food processing, manufacturing, finance, property and business services. In a frank assessment of its own performance, the ANTA newsletter showed how inadequate training is for industry's actual needs. The newsletter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia needs to deliver work skills more strategically than in the past to meet industry needs.</PARA>
<PARA>It also stated that we need to `bridge the gaps between industry priorities and the education and training system more cost effectively than in the past'&mdash;and this is not something that was said two or three years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that, in answer to a dorothy dixer in the House on 30 August, the minister was trying to paint the best picture of the CEDA report. He talked about seminars&mdash;when they were held, et cetera&mdash;but, despite his apologies for the CEDA report, here we have ANTA, in its newsletter of September this year, repeating the same thing, that the training agenda is simply not meeting industry needs. And this comes from industry workshops held in the last three to six months, ascertaining the needs of industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The newsletter said that Australia needs to deliver work skills more strategically, but it was really saying that we are still not doing it. The newsletter had further startling revelations. We learn that approximately three years after it was established, it is apparently only now&mdash;you have to take it at face value in its own newsletter&mdash;that the authority has tried to identify industry training needs by a series of workshops. The newsletter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The authority has attempted&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I repeat `attempted'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to develop a better understanding of industry training needs.</PARA>
<PARA>The authority is constantly talking about the need to ascertain industry needs. But, if you believe the rhetoric, read what has been written in the past and listen to what the minister and the senior minister, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), are saying about it, you would think it has all been done and that we are on the road to recovery. But it is simply not being delivered at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comment begs the question as to whether such work has ever been carried out previously. One of ANTA's key roles surely is to provide this link with industry and to give industry a greater role in training, but only now is the authority, to use its words, attempting to identify what industry training needs are. I would have thought it a bit late for the school leavers of 1993 and 1994 and, in all likelihood, 1995, and regrettably even beyond. To make matters worse, it appears this process has only been completed for some sectors. According to the newsletter, the workshops are still to take place in the wholesale and retail trade&mdash;an area of enormous employment in this country&mdash;and in the communications and community services sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the view of the member for Fraser that there are unmet needs in these areas, surely work regarding industry training needs should have been carried out well before now. The major theme common to every training commentary over recent times is that a gap exists. Again, the newsletter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . between industry needs and education and training systems.</PARA>
<PARA>In September 1995 ANTA admits that one of the main problems faced by industry is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .  the main gaps identified were between industry needs and education and training systems.</PARA>
<PARA>When it is all said and done, all the assurances and all the fuzzy language have meant nothing. Some in the government would have us believe that this is the right direction for Australia. If we are to accept that Australia's international competitiveness is related to work skills, clearly this present approach is not good enough for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without a successful training system we will not have a successful work force, and we will hinder the successful transition to adulthood of many young Australians. A recent speech by senior university lecturer Mr John Freeland to a conference on the future of work outlined that approximately one in seven 15- to 19-year-olds is at grave risk of failing to become a successful adult. He found that the collapse in the job market for teenagers meant that this group were more disadvantaged than in 1983. Mr Freeland said that those at grave risk in the transition to adulthood were teenagers who were not full-time students and who were unemployed or permanently outside the labour force. Mr Freeland states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is reasonable to assume that approximately 15 per cent of teenagers are at grave risk of not making an effective transition to adulthood and active citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA>Fifteen per cent! A country we are all proud of will have 15 per cent of these kids not making that transition. Mr Freeland went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .  increased schooling can defer the manifestation of the transitional problem, but it has not, and will not, provide a solution to the collapse in employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA>The government can boast about its record on retention rates all it wants&mdash;and I notice that it is quoting 1993 figures; it is not quite so keen to quote more recent ones&mdash;but this will not take away from the fact that it has been unable to provide young Australians with proper full-time, long-term employment. It has only been in recent weeks that again questions have been raised as to whether the government's $1.55 billion, five-year plan to boost the country's TAFE system is achieving its aims. There have also been questions raised as to whether this funding has led to the promised dramatic increase in TAFE places. The honourable member might not be quite as fussed about this comment as he was about his previous one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Richard Sweet, a member of the ANTA research advisory council, has predicted that the soon-to-be-released TAFE statistics for 1994 will only show an increase in enrolments of one or two per cent during the previous year. I challenge the minister to assure the parents and students of Australia that this will not be the case. Mr Sweet has gone so far as to query whether all the money that has been put into TAFE has been well spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no doubt that Richard Sweet is a highly respected participant in and commentator on the training agenda in this country. That he has been driven to make such a comment should be a cause of deep concern. The TAFE system desperately needs leadership&mdash;the type of leadership that a government which is serious about training in this country should be providing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many in the TAFE sector are looking for direction and many teachers within the sector are feeling confused and, in some cases, threatened by the training reform agenda. As the largest non-industry training provider in this country, the TAFE sector is in need of an urgent restatement of the pivotal role it plays in the provision of the nation's training and the vital role it plays in equipping our work force with the skills we need to make our country competitive and to make our young people able to participate in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the TAFE teachers who are at the forefront of both the technological and administrative changes which have been made to the sector. All of us in this House should commend them on the dedication and commitment they have displayed during these changes. The system will only be as good as the people who teach in it. The best equipment and the best facilities will mean nothing if we do not have teachers who feel part of the reform process and who feel confident about meeting the challenges which lie ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also remember that training for training's sake is not an alternative to employment. It never has been and it never will be. What the government's reforms and training have done is keep many young Australians in the limbo land of training but with no job at the end of it. Surely it is not too much to expect, in a country with the resources and potential of Australia, that our young people can look forward to full-time employment. On any measure, the government has failed in its commitment to these young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, Australia needs a vocational education and training system that is flexible and offers choice and quality in post-secondary training programs and post-compulsory education. This can be achieved by gaining relevant skills based training and ensure a competitive training sector through an open and flexible training market. We also need to maintain the integrity of the TAFE system and allow TAFE to maintain its strength and its rightful role as the central training body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that when it comes to training we are not doing well&mdash;far from it&mdash;nor are we on the right track. Indeed, if anything, we are on the wrong track. It is too late for soothing words and false assurances. Even on the best case test, the training sector in Australia is at the crossroads and the challenge is clearly there. How we answer this challenge will determine how we stand as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the couple of minutes I have left, I will go through a couple of further points. If you look at Working Nation, which the Prime Minister is so proud of talking about, you will see that it actually makes some fairly disturbing commentaries. Page 90 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have one of the lowest rates of participation in apprenticeships in the OECD.</PARA>
<PARA>It is simply not good enough for the minister to come in here and talk about levels of apprenticeships and attack those making comments about the level of apprenticeships in this country. The CEDA report has quite clearly shown, despite what the minister says about this, that as a percentage of the labour force we are doing very badly. Indeed, that percentage is at its lowest in the last three decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the minister attacking the authors of that report? He said yesterday that anyone who dared take him on about his comments on the level of apprenticeships and traineeships in this country is lying and telling porkies, but the CEDA report quite rightly shows that this has been a failure. The minister is making comments about the size of the labour force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I go to the substance of the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill, I would like to refer to the comment made by the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) about the low proportion of apprentices in the labour force. He forgot a couple of crucial points. He never mentioned anything about traineeships. He never mentioned anything about the labour force increasing from six million to eight million. If his comment were serious, I would have thought he would have mentioned those integral figures and that he would have mentioned something about traineeships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has an appalling record on education in this country. As I have pointed out in this House many times, issues relating to education and training are usually met with a derisive yawn from those on the opposition benches. However, you can tell an election is in the air. During the previous debate on higher education and this debate on vocational education and training, we see a belated attempt by marginal Liberal and National Party members to become aware of educational issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they think for one minute that belated contributions will fool the Australian electorate, they will be sadly mistaken. The Australian electorate are calling out to their federal members to exercise consistency, commonsense and loyalty to their beliefs. They assume that they have some. The Australian electorate are rejecting the stunt manufacturers, the penchant for the one-line grabs, the image makers in which any substance or genuineness and long-term commitment are totally absent. The Australian electorate also reject the media reporting in print and television in particular in which consistent critical analysis and objective reporting are totally absent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has created a decade of expansion of opportunity in education and training. This bill, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill, provides additional funding to the vocational education and training sector in order to upgrade the nation's skills. The increased funds will enable further growth in the number of student places, maintain infrastructure spending in real terms and enable the key objectives of the Australian National Training Authority agreement to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, was established to develop and administer a national vocational education system. Its objectives are to create a national vocational education and training system to foster close interaction between industry and vocational education and training providers, to create an effective training market and an efficient and very productive network of publicly funded providers, to provide increased opportunities and improved outcomes for individuals and target groups, and to improve links between schools, higher education and vocational education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, its objectives seek to guarantee that young people have the opportunity to get the skills they need to get the jobs they want. Since Working Nation commenced, the results prove its success. Unemployment is unacceptably high at 8.5 per cent nationally compared to 11.1 per cent in 1993&mdash;a significant decline of around nine per cent. The number of long-term unemployed people has fallen by over 20 per cent. The government's promise to create more than 500,000 new jobs has already been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions in this bill are designed to build on these successes. The government's commitment to the expansion of the vocational education and training sector is proven. The further $70 million in growth funds committed here brings the total growth funding provided by the federal government over the period 1993 to 1997 to $1.5 billion. I would have thought that figure showed a government that cares about vocational education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is providing a total of $940 million in direct funding for vocational education and training this year. That is a 7 1/2 per cent increase over 1994-95, and that does mean more student places. You would think that the opposition would welcome that increase instead of being mean spirited about government initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government's recurrent funding in 1996 will provide 300,000 student places over and above what the states and territories are providing. The growth funds will provide a further 35,000 places per year. Does the opposition welcome that? Of course not. This commitment contrasts starkly with the opposition, which has demonstrated no such commitment to vocational education and training, nor to higher education, nor to schools, nor to child care, nor to anything of consequence to this nation's young people and to this nation's collective future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Liberals were last in government, federally seven out of 10 young Australians left the education system without completing high school. It was criminal neglect which left too many people, particularly young people, very vulnerable to the changing needs of the economy as it modernised. Now their colleagues in the state governments are turning the clock back. They are denying opportunity rather than enhancing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Mr Dean Brown became Premier of South Australia two years ago he promised more money for education and training. The facts, of course, are very different. The truth is very different. By 1996 he will have chopped $100 million out of the education budget, and the TAFE system is being similarly gutted. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TAFE system&mdash;the vocational education and training system&mdash;has been similarly gutted in South Australia, despite the desperate need for education and training opportunities in the most depressed state in the country. It is the state with the highest unemployment in the nation. That is Premier Brown's legacy after two years. Mr Brown talks about creating high-tech industries and a skilled economy&mdash;a leading edge economy. That is very important and I acknowledge its importance, yet he fails to grasp the simple fact that the foundation of a successful world-class economy is a successful world-class education system, including higher education, vocational education and training and schools to provide the economy with the skills base it needs, especially in these times of rapid technological change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Brown returned recently from his tour of America and various other places. He said that he was told by leading industry figures in America that they had heard that South Australia was a world leader. Mr Brown smugly paraded that piece of nonsense; after all, he had nothing else to show for the trip. There are no prizes for guessing that this bit of nonsense was peddled by someone hoping to pick up a valuable state-owned asset&mdash;maybe the waterworks. It is nonsense because South Australia is not leading the world; I wish it were. In fact, it is coming last in this nation. The Liberals have virtually closed the state down. A couple of days ago the Court government closed Western Australia down. Brown is doing the same thing in South Australia in slow motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, South Australia now has the worst unemployment figures and the weakest economic growth figures in the nation. Between the December 1993 election and June 1995 the rate of job growth was one-third that achieved nationally. In June there were 3,000 fewer South Australians in work compared to a rise of 52,000 nationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The habitual deceit and secrecy of the Brown government has been recently exposed. That is important because it is the state government that manages and administers TAFE in South Australia.

In June there were 3,000 fewer South Australians in work compared with a rise of 52,000 nationally. Yet, despite this miserable record, the Brown government has abandoned the youth strategy project. Youth programs delivered by TAFE have been savaged. Those in the most disadvantaged groups, including Aborigines, have been the most severely hit.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is not only Mr Brown who has been caught out performing some ex post facto reasoning. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has also been caught out attempting to deceive the electorate.

The Liberals do not have any commitment to vocational education and training and they have no commitment to higher education. They still fail to grasp the critical link between a strong education and training system and the building of a modern, efficient economy which this nation demands. In contrast, the federal Labor government's record is proven. Labor has created a decade of expansion of education opportunity. It has increased opportunity for individuals, lifted our economic performance and provided the skills and flexibility needed in our emerging modern economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the opposition were last in government, seven out of 10 young Australians left the education system without completing high school. Now their colleagues in the state governments are repeating the same policies. They are quashing opportunities for our young rather than enhancing opportunity. The opposition are promising nothing to the future students of this country. They do not support equitable access to education and training. They do not support growth in the higher education and vocational education and training sectors. Judging by the record of the Liberal governments in the states, they still fail to grasp the link between education and training and the nation's economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Australian public, particularly Australian youth, could be so unlucky as to have the opposition win government at the next federal poll, students, schools and others involved in higher education and vocational education and training can expect, as has happened in the states, a dismantling of educational values. The federal opposition would make the same savage cuts as have been made by their counterparts in the states. They would contract opportunity rather than expand it. They would turn students out of the education and training system rather than fund their futures. </PARA>

The opposition of course will deny this, but the facts prove they are prepared to tell untruths to the Australian people in order to get elected. I believe Australians deserve better; South Australians deserve better; the people in my electorate of Port Adelaide deserve better. This bill funds the future for young Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use this opportunity to pay tribute to the people of the Hills and Hawkesbury districts in Sydney for the efforts they are making in providing education and training opportunities for business, for employers and employees, for educational and training programs that have been developed for people seeking to improve their opportunities and status, and also for their support for those in need and those who are without jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program in the north-west section of Sydney has come under an organisation called the Hills Hawkesbury Initiative for Excellence. It has received some funding for job clubs from the Commonwealth government, attached to this legislation. However, the funding program has been minimal because there is a mind-set within the government that, because it is considered to be a high income area, there is no need for support. That is far from the truth because, as the House would be aware, during the recession the last group in our community to suffer retrenchment was those in middle management. As organisations flattened their management structures, people pushed onto the unemployment queues were those in middle management&mdash;often middle aged males with teenage families and heavy mortgage commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the government appeared to lack interest in this problem, the community took charge of the process and established the group. Within that group, all the Rotary and Lions clubs, the churches, the chambers of commerce and the educational institutions&mdash;50-odd organisations&mdash;joined together to see what could be done to improve the capacity of the community both to create jobs and to place people in work. The process has been very successful and is moving ahead. There is now increased interest from some excellent officers in the Department of Employment, Education and Training to see whether, in that district of Sydney, innovative programs can be introduced to allow training for the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has not been easy to devise programs that meet the government's goals because, in part, they appear to be unrelated to the workplace, the bureaucratic necessities for accountability&mdash;all of those things which are hardly objectionable but which are difficult for a community group to assess if they are unsupported, as we have been, by professionals. However, things are moving ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pay tribute to the community that I represent. They have been superb. They have been generous in their provision of money to help those who are unemployed. They have been generous with their time in seeking to expand opportunities. In particular, I pay tribute to the board of the Hills Initiative for Excellence and to the chairmen of the various councils of the board&mdash;Jeff Strong, who is the chairman of the business council, David Adam, who is chairman of the welfare and support council, the education council and its various chairmen over a period of time&mdash;for the results that have been achieved. </PARA>

Much of this remedial funding should have been put into the system two years ago. You are too slow with your response.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer in particular to an area of education research that relates in part to vocational education and to higher education. We have had two educational bills in a row, so it is difficult to completely fit my remarks into the total ambit of this bill. But the link between higher education and vocational education is something that many speakers have referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the House to the growing concern in Australia of the capacity for us to conduct agricultural research, education and outreach in Australia at all levels of education in a way that is appropriate to Australia's status in education and as a major exporter of agricultural products and value added products from an agricultural base. We have not been successful in having governments focus on this area of agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have, however, looked at new technology, waste disposal, environmental sciences and a number of very worthy areas. But I believe the agricultural industries of Australia need to be, as one of our major exporters, better served by a new emphasis and a new focus on world best practice in both education and export effort. We will lose much of the impetus that we have gained by excellent research, by excellent education and by outstanding outreach over the last 20 or 30 years unless we apply a fresh and dynamic initiative to these areas of agricultural production and science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that in Victoria and Queensland there is beginning to be a focus on these areas, but there is no initiative from the Commonwealth. I would like to see the Commonwealth take an initiative to integrate, to draw together and to provide visions and goals for agricultural research, education and outreach at a national level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my state of New South Wales, despite numerous reports for the need for there to be change, successive governments have been reluctant to apply any direction whatsoever. The problem with agricultural research, and particularly agricultural education, is that it is an expensive part of the educational cycle and it is very tempting for governments to cut and cut, thereby reducing the quality and increasing the diversity and the lack of cohesion in agricultural education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 27 institutions in Australia teaching agriculture at a higher level. Then we have a further diversity in the vocational areas, through TAFE and other instrumentalities mainly administered by the state. It seems to me that with greater focus it would be possible to pick up and apply at a national level some of the processes the integrated system in Victoria has identified. In South Australia there has been a move to closer unity so that we are focusing on agricultural industries and we are giving opportunity for and drive to employment and research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble I see confronting Australia is that, if we drop off in our application to agricultural education and research, we will find in 20 years time that, instead of leading the world in what we are doing, we will be overtaken by emerging countries or maybe by the existing high quality practice countries of Europe and the United States. I think that would be dreadful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is at the forefront in agricultural production and processing. Our food processing industries are some of the best in the world and are growing at the fastest rate of any industry within Australia. So I believe we should be capitalising on this process rather than saying, `We have performed well in agriculture. There is no need to give it our attention. There is no need to focus on agricultural education at a vocational or higher education level because we have done well in the past.' There is no real impetus there. There is no new thought. There is no new application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have letters from state and federal ministers, including the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Simon Crean. He said that he did not want to touch anything in this area, that it was just all too hard and that it had to be left to the states and the institutions. There was not even the willingness to have a working party or task force examine these issues. If something of that nature were done, I think it would create discussion and interest right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this vein, a number of interesting papers have come to my attention. One is a paper by Lindsay Falvey and Barrie Bardsley addressing the integrated system for Victoria which I understand is going into place. South Australia has been successful with an integrated system. I understand that, as recently as in the last three months, that process has been put into place in Queensland. But there is no national direction or incentive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the House's attention to an article by David Smiles in the January edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Agricultural Science</EMPHASIS>. The article is entitled `A vision and challenge for agricultural science'. Much of it relates to the educational processes and to the fact that we need to have an open educational process. Agriculture is one of Australia's major export earners and new opportunities exist for our agricultural exports to grow significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These opportunities will tend to be specialist. They will not be quite as they were in the past. They will require greater skill of production, processing, packaging, marketing, financing and transportation. We must be able to realise these opportunities. We need a national impetus. I know, from talking to a diverse range of people on all sides of the parliament, there is a view held that that should happen. But there appears to be just complete inertia on the part of the educational establishment and the bureaucratic establishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The caucus chairman in the Labor Party, for instance, endorses the views that I am expressing today. John Kerin endorses those views. Senator David Brownhill endorses those views. Many people across Australia endorse the view that we need a new impetus, a new vision and a new challenge for agricultural education and research. Yet nothing appears to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am just making a plea, putting down what I hope will be only for the first time my concerns in this regard. I intend to pursue this matter. I believe that, without first-class education and research to teach future generations of highly motivated students, the potential for Australian agriculture will not be achieved, and we will all suffer by that&mdash;there will be fewer jobs in the cities as well as in the bush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That change has been, I believe, greatly and very clearly enunciated by one of the doyens of Australian agriculture, a brilliant plant breeder, recognised by the Queen and his fellow Australians, Mr Nick Derera. He has contributed so much to the production of wheat and cotton in Australia. He is a superb man. Nick Derera has outlined the need for better agricultural education needs and restructuring in an article entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reform of university education in agriculture</EMPHASIS>, which was published recently in an Australian Institute of Agricultural Science publication. Nick Derera basically has dealt with university education, higher education, but he averts to the need for the integrated approach to flow right into the vocational area as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the House also to articles from the Crawford Fund for International Agricultural Research. That group also gives emphasis to the need for Australia to be dynamic in its relationship with our neighbours and the international production of food, by drawing on the skills that are within our community and extending them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a recent letter to me from the Crawford Fund for International Agricultural Research, it was pointed out that the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) and John Kerin had all agreed on the significance for Australia's outreach into international circles at all levels. That will mean a completely integrated approach in this area of agricultural science and education vocational levels at TAFE&mdash;even at a high school level TAFE&mdash;at college, at university higher education and above. </PARA>

The bill gives further expression to the government's strong commitment to expand vocational education and training in Australia.

It is very much in line with the philosophical approach that we have always pursued to education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will provide for supplementary appropriations for 1995 and 1996 to take account of price movements, as well as appropriating some $950 million in 1997. This represents a dramatic increase in funding to the sector since 1983. I am not quite sure where members of the opposition are coming from or where they are gaining their information as far as the government's allocation of resources to the TAFE sector is concerned, but I would point out to the House that in 1983 around $232 million was allocated to the TAFE sector. In 1995, after some 12 years of Labor government, that has been increased to $778 million, with a commitment in 1997 to around $950 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mark of the Commonwealth's commitment in this area can be appreciated from the following: Commonwealth recurrent funding in 1996 will provide around 300,000 student places over what the states and territories are currently providing. We are also providing $70 million in growth funds for 1996 and 1997 which will provide an extra 35,000 places per year. Part of that is capital expenditure. In 1995, some $227 million will be spent on upgrading and expanding colleges of technical and further education. Later on in this address to the parliament I will reflect on the contribution of the Gordon Technical College to vocational education in the Geelong region in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there would be too much disagreement on both sides of the House on the necessity for the nation to put resources into vocational education and training&mdash;indeed, education generally.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as society is concerned, a society which has its people engaged in the quest for the acquisition of new skills and new education and training is a society which is internally dynamic.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Listening to members of the opposition in the debate on this bill, and to their comments on education and training, there does not seem to be a real appreciation among them of the enormous structural changes that have been visited upon the Australian economy in the last two decades. We have seen the emergence of new markets, new consumer tastes and the exponential proliferation of new technologies. We are in the midst of a revolution which many of us do not fully understand. I do not think that understanding is there on the benches on the other side of this House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just speculate for a moment on the characteristics that modern enterprises will require to hack it in the new global marketplace. Those enterprises must have a capacity to adapt to changing economic environments, which, as I mentioned before, are the changing taste of consumers, the various market pressures that are brought to bear on enterprises and the legal and economic structures in which they operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The modern enterprise needs to be inherently innovative in the products that it develops for the marketplace, in the ways it has to do things and, of course, in the management of the work tasks within the enterprise. Another important characteristic of the modern enterprise that will survive in this global economy is the need to decentralise its decision making and to flatten its structures of management. It has to display a capacity to adapt to new technologies and the capacity to create a more humane working environment. Profit comes from cooperation rather than from exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention these things because the key to the innovative, modern enterprise is the resources that it allocates within the enterprise to the training of its employees and the manner in which it avails itself of the education and training that is provided to it by government through the vocational training and educational structures. I think here in Australia we have made some giant strides in this area. We have made enormous gains in the vocational education and training area. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Overall, in society, I think there is a greater awareness of the need for individuals in the work force to acquire and expand their skills. As far as the system is concerned, this government has dramatically expanded the access of Australians to skill acquisition by expanding the institutional places. The delivery institutions themselves have been revolutionised in their structures and their outlooks and, of course, the obvious linkages between those institutions and industry have been further developed, expanded and strengthened. These are the real achievements of Labor in power in the last 12 to 13 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has given expression to its belief in the need for better vocational education training resources through its Working Nation program, which has been discussed already here in this debate. That particular program had two primary aims&mdash;to increase economic growth and to expand the job opportunities that were available to Australians. The statistics speak for themselves. Some 655,000 new jobs have been created in the Australian economy since this government was returned to power in 1993&mdash;655,000 jobs that the opposition said could never be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us in this House not forget that the opposition said that Working Nation was a waste of money, that it should not be spent and that the government would never achieve its target of creating 500,000 jobs in its term of office. Here we are, 2 1/2 years in, and we have exceeded that expectation by 155,000 jobs with the creation of 655,000 jobs in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major objective of Working Nation was to reduce unemployment, especially among the long-term unemployed, and we have been spectacularly successful in doing that. A major element of Working Nation was the reforms that it made to labour market programs. It represented a massive attempt to lift the skills of the nation, and it represented a comprehensive attempt to introduce greater flexibility into those programs to meet industry requirements. Those labour market programs are now delivered in close partnership with industry. The achievements in the employment area, as I have mentioned, have been spectacular. We have seen long-term unemployment rates go down by 23 per cent, and of course the unemployment rate has been reduced from its peak of 11.2 per cent down to 8.3 per cent in August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as vocational education and training are concerned, more people are participating in entry level training now than at any time in the previous three decades. Apprentice and trainee commencements as a proportion of the 15- to 19-year-old age group are now at the record levels that were reached in the late 1980s. There have been spectacular improvements in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the return to the House of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), who led the debate for the opposition here today on this particular bill. I do not agree with his proposition that the training that is being undertaken by young Australians is far removed from industry experience. The Gordon Technical College in my electorate is one of the major institutions for delivery of vocational education and training. That institution has very extensive links with industry. I would suggest to the honourable member for Ballarat that he read the August-September edition of the college's publication, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Gordon</EMPHASIS>, to see what it is doing. That edition describes the degree to which the institution is making a very real and practical effort to meet the training needs of local industry in Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the honourable member for Ballarat and other members who sit opposite really do not have any real claims in this particular debate. The honourable member for Ballarat, as we know, hangs on to his seat by a hair's-breadth. I guess at the next election the young people in Ballarat will not forget his support for the $3 per hour youth wage. What a solution! I would have thought the honourable member for Ballarat would have been highly embarrassed at having supported that particular proposition. Yet honourable members opposite went along like lemmings and fell over the cliff with `Honest John' Hewson and `Honest John' Howard. They fell over the cliff like lemmings. We are sneaking up to that cliff in 1996. Over they will go. The lemmings will all go over again. Last time it was Fightback; this time it will be industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The young people in Ballarat will not forget their member's support for the massive cutback to the jobskills program and the LEAP program, which was suggested in Fightback. I guess they will not forget either his support for zero tariffs and how that would have thrown out of work a lot of people in Ballarat in the automotive industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went to school in the same town as the honourable member for Ballarat. I know, as he knows, that Ballarat has a very good educational infrastructure, in both the private and public sectors. But I have not read anywhere in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ballarat Courier</EMPHASIS> the honourable member for Ballarat sinking the slipper into the Kennett government over its deliberate run-down of the educational infrastructure in Ballarat, Geelong and other regional communities. If you are fair dinkum about the points you are making in these debates&mdash;I speak about not just the honourable member for Ballarat but also all members opposite&mdash;you have to display a bit of credibility. When somebody like Jeff Kennett hoes into the education system in Victoria, you have got to stand up and be counted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as vocational education in Geelong is concerned, I mentioned the Gordon Technical College, which is one of Victoria's oldest technical institutions and it has a long and proud history in that state of delivering vocational education. The federal government's commitment to Geelong has been some $30 million to refurbish that institution and to build a manufacturing industry training centre to service the needs of Geelong manufacturing enterprises. I reject the charge by honourable members opposite that this government is not addressing the training needs of industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say this about the comments that have been made in this debate thus far by members of the opposition. Listening to you, you would think that training was only the responsibility of government. You know and I know that Australian industry has one of the most pathetic training records of any Western country. It was only when the Labor government held the gun at Australian industry's head that it woke up to the fact that its survival in the long term depended very much on putting resources into training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Gordon Technical College on the initiatives it has taken in China and Indonesia to expand the export of its educational services. It is doing some excellent work in that field. Time does not permit me to reflect on the Alcoa experiment. I will do this at a later date. But it really puts paid to the lie that is being put by the opposition that the training programs that are sponsored by this government do not relate to Australian industry. </PARA>

Japan and Germany place heavy emphasis in their education investment dollars on vocational training. The United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and other debt ridden economies slant more of their education investment dollars at the tertiary and higher education sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the period 1972 to 1995, we have seen the traditional concept of the university in Australia change to include all colleges of advanced education, TAFE colleges and other educational institutions following on from secondary school. To enter a higher educational institution in Australia, young Australians need to achieve a tertiary entrance standard. What do these tertiary entrance standards tell us?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They tell us this: our youth need to attain 12 or 13 years of general education and an age of 17 to 18 years before being offered specialist vocational training. The government is deliberately delaying the education of their youth and their preparation for the work force. Educational policies of the Labor government act to keep official unemployment figures down. Non-academic students over 15 years of age are prevented from leaving school because of lack of jobs, lack of preparedness to enter the work force, as a direct result of inadequate policies on vocational education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The courses of higher education offered to and accepted by most Australian youth are determined by their ranked performance in a general academic education and not their specific abilities and talents. The delay in preparing young Australians for the work force and their independence with adequate financial means is totally out of step with the social, psychological and material ways in which we prepare them to enter society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Modern Australian youth are just as ready, if not more ready, to enter the work force as their counterparts of 20 to 30 years ago. We, the parents and grandparents of the postwar era, have successfully raised the aspirations of our children to achieve a higher social and educational standing and awareness. Today's youth have the following improved attributes: a greater knowledge and information at their fingertips, a greater social and democratic consciousness of their rights and entitlements in an affluent society, and a greater initiative and desire to achieve the aspirations drummed into them from birth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has failed them. Labor has, for the last 20 years, overseen a decline in the real living standards of the average Australian family, a massive increase in the gap between the rich and poor, the erosion of our industrial base, the disintegration of our international competitiveness and the total disregard by the Hawke and Keating Labor governments of the health and future of our youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's legacy to Australian youth is no jobs, delayed and often irrelevant education during years of secondary schooling, poor social mobility and, above all, poor vocational mobility. In the industrial suburbs of Australia Labor's legacy has manifested itself into serious cultural problems that are quickly spreading out to all elements of Australian society. These cultural problems have now been a norm for as many as two or more generations of the one family in the industrial dormitories of Australia. It is these traditional areas that Labor has relied upon for rank and file membership and votes, but no more. The youth of Australia and their parents and grandparents have had enough of Prime Minister Keating and Labor's appalling legacy, which can be detailed as follows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's youth suicide rate is amongst the highest in the Western world. The social problems facing Australian youth include serious alcohol and drug abuse, morals breakdown and permissiveness. There are significant mental health problems among our youth&mdash;youth are very much our future&mdash;including lack of self-confidence, anger at continual failure and rejection, desperation at scholastic irrelevance and failure, lack of positive self-concept, poor self-discipline and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Domestic violence is a further concern. Domestic violence is due very much to the policies of this Labor government. It appears that our society now accepts husband-wife and parent-child abuse as a norm for domestic violence in Australia. But Labor, through its deliberate lack of relevant and appropriate vocational education and training policies and its forced delayed specialisation of youth education has forced the average age of adult children staying at home due to economic circumstances to be 23 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the latest and most disturbing statistics in domestic violence in Australia is that of frustrated, desperate youth, with no future, bashing their parents. This is Labor's shame&mdash;Prime Minister Keating's shame. It is his reward to ordinary Australians and their families for supporting his level playing field economic rationalism which has dispossessed their children. This dispossession is tearing the fabric of Australian society away from our youth during their adolescent years of 13 to 17 when the professionalism of teachers throughout the country is prevented from assessing their suitability for academic studies in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the years 13 to 17 approximately 60 to 80 per cent of our youth fail to make the grades for higher academic learning. Labor has created a system in which vocational education is not available to meet the needs and abilities of our youth until the age of 17 to 18 years after they have generally experienced total personal failure and persecution for two, three, four or even five years of their high school education. This is the majority of the population that Japan and Germany spend much of their education investment dollars on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standard of professionalism of the Australian teaching profession is so high that the academic abilities of students can be accurately assessed at ages as low as years 1, 2 and 3 in primary schools. The trend in our schooling system under Labor is to totally suppress such progressive assessments and to have students wallow in failure and low self-esteem for years until vocational education comes their way, generally more by good luck than by good educational management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a matter of fact, the massive problems facing youth today in our education system are a direct result of state education systems following a line of Labor Party direction to retard educational opportunity in order to suppress the facts about true unemployment and economic decline in Australia. The health of the nation's education system is a direct indictment of the health of its economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best example of Labor's failure to provide the truth to parents about a lack of vocational educational opportunities to our youth, the retention of 15- to 17-year-olds at secondary schools to keep the real unemployment figures from blowing out and the victimisation of any teacher who speaks out on behalf of the real educational needs of youth is the Queensland state Department of Education. The Goss and Keating Labor governments will fall on their record of a lack of vocational education and lack of preparedness of Queensland youth for the work force at their next respective state and federal elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is a true and extraordinary account of a teacher's experience in the Queensland education system who has been speaking out about the lack of vocational education programs in Queensland secondary schools for 22 years. Since 1973, as a young teacher during the Whitlam Labor government, he saw tens of millions of dollars thrown at education with little or no direction or accountability towards the real needs of the youth of Australia. In 1991 Bob Wilson ended up at Ferny Grove State High School in the safe state Labor seat of Ferny Grove and the marginal federal seat of Dickson, held by the present Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). Labor will lose both of these seats at the next respective elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ferny Grove State High School was a large school with approximately 1,500 students which was totally preoccupied with its perceived public reputation for academic excellence rather than the individual needs of all of its students. In April 1992, Bob Wilson asked the principal, Ralph Took, to consider looking at the topics of `unemployment' and `the real needs of non-academic students' for in-service training of staff. The principal ruled that unemployment had nothing to do with the school's education programs. In 1993, the principal admitted that it was beyond his abilities `to link the educational needs of the individual students to courses that reflected the realities of the work force beyond school'. Surely, this type of attitude, as expressed by educational leaders in our society, has contributed to the downfall of standards and opportunities for our youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It follows that during 1991, 1992 and 1993 Bob Wilson expressed the need for vocational education for students&mdash;some as young as 13 years&mdash;to Principal Took. He also complained that the academic reputation of the school was fudged by some teachers who issued revision sheets that were mirror images of the test papers in classes before exams. This practice has been reported as widespread in many schools in Queensland and is a major failing and unfairness of the internal examination system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Wilson, who is reputed to be an excellent teacher with an exceptional ability to interact with and manage adolescent students, was seen as a threat to the Principal of Ferny Grove State High School and its policies of conservative academic education. The principal, Mr Ralph Took, put Mr Wilson on a diminished work performance procedure and threatened that he could lose his job if he continued to contest it. The concerns of Mr Wilson were twofold: firstly, he was concerned for his own career and financial security, which is understandable, and, secondly, he was concerned for those students who were disadvantaged at Ferny Grove State High School simply because they were not academically oriented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Wilson recalls going to supervise a grade 8 class whose teacher was absent. When he arrived the students said to him, `What are you doing here, sir?' He replied, `Your teacher is away and I've come to teach your class.' The students then replied, `But sir, you teach only good grade 8 classes; we're vegies, sir.' Those students were 12 and 13 year olds streamed into a lower ability class. Physically, socially and mentally&mdash;in every way&mdash;they were normal sons and daughters of everyday Australians, except they were not academically bright. Their true strengths and abilities were unknown because the education system does not assess them. In an academically oriented system, students such as those already failing in year 8 will experience total failure in all years until leaving or year 12. They will progress even with failures. I point out that four classes out of the 12 grade 8 classes at Ferny Grove State High School in that year were in that category. It was for those students that Bob Wilson had been fighting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Wilson took stress leave in March 1994 to fight his case through the Goss government's Public Sector Management Commission's accountability legislation. He went to a level 3 grievance. Principal Took was ordered to withdraw the diminished work performance unconditionally among other directions of the report. Mr Wilson's sin was to speak out about the need for vocational education and training for most students during their high school years and the need to assess students again at 13 to 14 years. It was not the policy of Ferny Grove State High School to meet the real educational needs of the students. Obviously, Mr Wilson was making valid points and pointed out the resultant discipline problems in the school due to the existing academic educational programs for all students. He was seen by Principal Took as a threat to the reputation of the school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the level 3 grievance process, senior education department officers closed ranks to protect Principal Took from charges of professional misconduct. As a result of serious breaches of statutory duty by officers of the government superannuation office and the education department, Wilson was unlawfully retired by the education department so that Principal Took and others did not have to face an investigation of their breaches of statutory duty under public sector management standards. Wilson was retired because all investigations concerning an officer of the Public Service lapsed when he exited the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wilson then reported over 55 breaches of statutory duty by 14 departmental officers and two cases of official misconduct by Principal Took in his duties at Ferny Grove State High School to the Criminal Justice Commission to keep the system honest. The CJC merely rubber-stamped the actions of the education department until Wilson, with fully substantiated evidence, forced them to reopen the case. The CJC and the Crown Law Office advised the Director-General of Education, Mr Frank Peach, that Wilson's retirement was unlawful. Director-General Peach then changed the retirement of July 1994 to dismissal in July 1995 in case Wilson was reinstated. The Commissioner for Public Sector Equity does not hear dismissals and the time limit for an industrial court hearing had lapsed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July 1995, Director-General Peach sought crown law advice and options from the Government Superannuation Office, if he were to approve the re-employment of Wilson.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conference on 11 July this year, the delegates of the director-general rejected Wilson's offers for reinstatement. Wilson's offers fell within the parameters of the crown law sanctioned options of the Government Superannuation Office given to Director-General Peach.

Wilson signed a deed of settlement based on information misrepresented by the delegates of the director-general. Wilson vitiated the deed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Documents obtained since have shown that senior executive officers, including Director-General Peach, have deliberately lied to the Minister for Education and the Criminal Justice Commission about the Wilson case in order to prevent his reinstatement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What chance do the youth of Australia have to gain relevant assessment of their abilities and access to vocational education at an appropriate age if teachers like Bob Wilson are banished from the teaching profession for simply advocating vocational education for non-academic students? The Director-General of Education in Queensland, Mr Frank Peach, along with the Principal of Ferny Grove State High School, Mr Ralph Took, should be condemned for their breaches of statutory duty in this sordid affair. Mr Peach, it seems, was little more than a political appointee of the Goss Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Criminal Justice Commission must also be condemned for its breach of statutory independence and fairness in the public interest for its role in rubber-stamping the unlawful action of the Department of Education.

<PARA>The purpose of this package of bills is to rationalise into a single framework the 59 separate levies and charges acts currently imposing levies on primary industry products. It complements the significant rationalisation of the levies and charges collection legislation that took place in 1991 and is consistent with the Blewett report that sought to reduce the parliamentary legislative program. It is designed to overcome past problems caused by the volume of primary industries and energy portfolio legislation and the logjam the levies and charges legislation created by requiring constant amendment in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have analysed the problem, consulted extensively with industry and concluded that amalgamating all the levies and charges into two framework acts will make more effective use of parliamentary time dealing with levy legislation. It will also assist industry to have changes to levies put in place more rapidly than on some occasions in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levies and charges in question are not unilaterally imposed by the government, but rather are sought by representative industry bodies, on behalf of the industry. Their purpose is to fund activities such as marketing and research and development that would be beyond the scope of individual farmers on their own. I would expect that more levies will be requested by industry in the future, particularly in new and emerging industries and most probably for R&amp;D. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levies bill and the charges bill set up a framework for imposing levies on primary industry products by regulation. They will allow new industries or new products to be included quickly on the request of the industry concerned, while at the same time protecting parliament's powers to decide on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that this streamlining process will not change the practical impact of the current legislation but only the way levies are established or amended. There will be no discernible difference from the industry point of view in the way that the levies and charges processes operate, other than that any changes they wish to make to maximum levy or charge rates will be able to be completed in a much shorter time frame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously, maximum rates for levies and charges were included in each individual levy or charge act to give parliament control over any arbitrary imposition of taxation. Because of the wide variety of bases for the calculation of the levy and charge rates it was not possible to find a suitable formula covering all industries to include in the framework legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills therefore require the maximum rates of each levy or charge to be set out in special regulations. Normal regulations come into effect on gazettal before they are tabled in parliament. These special regulations will not come into effect until after the parliamentary disallowance period is completed. This still gives the parliament the ultimate role in determining maximum rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Impositions of levy or changes to levy matters such as maximum and operative rates can only be made on the recommendation of the designated body and after the required consultation with the relevant industry. The bills also require any increases in maximum rates to be published in a daily newspaper in the states and territories to ensure that individuals in an industry are aware of them. Initially, the maximum rates to be included in the special regulations are likely to be the same as those currently applying in each industry, unless the industry has specifically sought a different rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills allow the minister to declare a designated body or bodies for each industry to make recommendations regarding the setting of levy or charge rates. Where there is more than one designated body for a particular industry, these bodies will be required to agree on any recommendations they make to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Designated bodies are also required to consult with other representative bodies. For example, if the designated body for a particular industry is a peak grower body, it is required by reference to section 22 of the Primary Industries Levies Bill 1995 to consult with any other eligible industry bodies set out in the relevant statutory marketing authority act before making recommendations to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevant industry or product regulations will contain the detail of the particular levies or charges; who is liable to pay them; how and when they will be collected; and what they will be used for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations for each industry will be very similar to the regulations currently in force, but will include some provisions from the old levy or charge acts that do not appear in the new bills because they were too specific for the framework nature of the new bills. We will be circulating draft copies of the regulations to industry organisations for comment when they are drafted. This continues the consultative approach we have adopted with industry through the development of this streamlined levy package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third bill is included in this package&mdash;the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995. This bill includes the repeal of the old levies and charges acts and a number of amendments to other acts that make reference to the old levy and charges acts. These amendments are necessary to ensure that levies and charges can still be collected and the correct amounts can be paid to the correct organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commencement date for this legislative package is 1 July 1996 to allow time for the regulations for all the relevant industries to be made and tabled in the parliament. However, certain sections of the legislation will commence on royal assent to allow designated bodies to be declared and maximum rates to be set in time for the commencement of operation of the levies and charges acts. Regulations relating to operative rates of levies and charges will also be able to be made and tabled for disallowance following royal assent, but these regulations will not come into force until the remainder of the act commences on 1 July 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A wide range of representative bodies in all the primary industries covered by the current levy and charge arrangements have given broad support to the approach being taken. Draft copies of these bills have been made available to these bodies for comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind honourable members that this legislation was inspired by two things: industry's need for a streamlined and more responsive process; and a need to make better use of parliamentary time. There are advantages on both sides by making this process work. I commend the bills to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition will not be supporting this package of primary industries bills. We will in fact be opposing them. While we understand the intention of these three bills is to streamline the process by which levies and charges are imposed on primary products principally for research and development, we have serious reservations about what is proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nub of our concern is that these bills would allow levies and charges to be imposed by regulation instead of having the present system, which requires legislation to establish levies and then to vary them. We know that the levies and charges in question are not imposed by the government but are sought by industry in order to undertake research and development and other activities beyond the scope of small scattered enterprises to organise and to put in place on their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's rationale in changing the process is to reduce the amount of time parliament spends amending levy and charge acts by introducing a standard framework that streamlines the process. But, so far as the coalition is concerned, this allows the government to fulfil an objective: it seems to want to remove one of the few opportunities afforded this parliament to debate the circumstances of industries whose efforts are fundamental to the economic health and prosperity of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not our principal reason for opposing the legislation, important as it is. Our primary objection is to be found in the problems identified by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which has clearly identified the problems that primarily concern the coalition. The committee found that both the Primary Industries Charges Bill 1995 and the Primary Industries Levies Bill 1995 effectively delegate power to the minister to impose a tax. Quite simply, they remove from the primary legislation the power to establish a tax. The coalition believes that this is inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standing committee suggested that, if the actual level of the charge could not be set for practical reasons in the primary act, it should at least prescribe a maximum rate or a means of calculating it. But in legislation before the House the maximum levy is set by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee recommended several options for dealing with this undesirable proposal of allowing ministers to effectively become responsible for setting the level of taxes. It suggested that the bills could be amended to provide that a regulation is adopted only after an affirmative resolution of both houses of parliament within a similar time frame to the proposed disallowable instrument. But, unfortunately, the government has chosen to ignore these serious concerns, hiding behind assurances in the explanatory memorandum that levies and charges will be set only at the request of industry bodies but failing to enshrine this principle in this legislation. We regard that as unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is also concerned that switching from legislation to regulation will significantly reduce the amount of time available for the parliament to consider the impositions of levies and charges. I note the second reading speech says that we need to make a better use of parliamentary time. Perhaps that reflects one of the problems in this place: there is an unfortunate lack of awareness, in general terms, of the very important nature of primary industry to the national economy and, in specific terms, of the critical role of research and development and promotion in securing our future in economic terms, given that that future is very heavily dependent upon our primary industries and their export performance. I suggest that we will be more dependent, rather than less dependent, in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it needs to be acknowledged that not only are these industries and their research and development and promotion efforts very important, but also it is extremely important that they can be fully and properly explored in this place. Often there is disagreement within an industry and disagreement between different states&mdash;as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) should well know&mdash;as to the desirability of introducing such levies and charges or altering levies and charges once they are there, irrespective of the merits of the program that they are to fund. No better mechanism exists than allowing for these very important matters&mdash;and in some cases you are imposing very real obligations on people who may not want to wear them against the majority wishes of their industry&mdash;to be properly debated in this place by the representatives of the various parts of the country, of those very industries and of the sections of those industries that are likely to be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am aware, in terms of the amount of parliamentary time involved, to date all matters we have seen since the introduction of the second chamber as a mechanism for dealing with legislation have ended up in the Main Committee and not here. So we believe that ensuring debate takes place is a very healthy thing to. We believe it does not unduly hold up procedures. We think it is an important part of accountability&mdash;something that, so far as this parliament is concerned, seems to be often overlooked by those opposite. In a very important way, it is a mechanism for ensuring that this House is safe from the charge of having imposed arrangements unreasonably or without adequate consultation on industries. It is a protective mechanism, if you like, for the parliament. For those reasons I have outlined, we will be opposing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the wool industry, which knows a great deal about levies and charges. Wool growers are still paying heavy taxes to cover the stockpile debt, as well as to contribute to research and development and promotion. I hope that tax burden can be relieved, despite the current problems of the industry, inasmuch as the debt servicing proportion of the tax&mdash;that 4.5 per cent&mdash;can be either significantly reduced or abolished altogether in the near future. That is going to depend very much on what happens in the industry over the next few months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, we find that the wool industry is facing a new crisis, which is causing quite a few of us to lose quite a bit of sleep at the moment. The indicated price has crashed from a high of 830c a kilo in May to 582c at sales today. Prices are now well below the cost of production for many, if not most, wool growers; yet, ironically, the underlying market fundamentals are, in the view of most of the industry, sound and the International Wool Secretariat believes that the situation will turn around early next year. I know that all of us in this House sincerely hope that, for the sake of wool growers, that recovery comes sooner than next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growers have done it tougher than almost any other primary producer, perhaps tougher than any other primary producer in recent times, and they really are in an extraordinarily difficult situation. In talking yesterday with those involved in the south-west Queensland farm build-up strategy, it was heart wrenching&mdash;and that is the only way to describe it&mdash;to hear of the plight that many grower families are finding themselves locked into at the moment. Some of them are really in absolutely impossible circumstances, owing vastly more than their leases are currently worth and in situations where one wonders how they are able to make any rational management decisions let alone personal decisions in an attempt to keep their personal lives together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you will forgive me for making that observation about the extraordinary personal pain that many of those people are feeling. Indeed, it has been an incredibly rough few years for the wool industry. Firstly, of course, they copped Labor's deliberately engineered, debilitating record high interest rates and the wider rural depression, which still has not ended despite some of the extraordinarily beat-up rhetoric that we hear from those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we saw wool growers suffering a situation where their own industry collapsed and prices collapsed, tumbled, to record low levels, magnifying the hardship that most were already experiencing. Then, just as things were beginning to turn around, the worst drought in living memory has struck eastern Australia, again denying those who have been left with the opportunity to consolidate and secure their futures in the industry a reasonable chance of securing their own best interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now those growers face a new chapter in the crisis, this one triggered by the continuing absence of key buyers from the market despite, as I have already said, the industry broadly agreeing that the market fundamentals are sound. There is good evidence for believing that the fundamentals are set to provide good hope of a reasonable recovery; we just hope it comes quickly enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supply of wool is significantly below historical demand and on a par with total sales in 1994-5 of about 770 million kilograms, including stockpiled wool. There has been a lot of focus on the activities of Wool International in handling the stockpile, the fixed release schedule. That was put in place at a time of enormous uncertainty&mdash;when the price of wool was below 400c a kilo, when the industry was just going backwards out the door so fast that you could not see it for dust. It removed the uncertainty of that dark cloud of the stockpile and the suggestion that no-one knew when or how it might be dumped onto the market at a critical time in the industry's future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That approach undergirded a resurgence of confidence in the industry. The industry purchasers of wool, in particular, came to see that there really was an intention this time to provide confidence, security and a definite way forward to end the chopping, the changing and the uncertainty that had occurred in the period surrounding the collapse of the reserve price scheme. I think that confidence played a major part in the substantial recovery that the industry made and which we had all hoped to see continue unabated from the time of around two years-plus ago that it was introduced. Of course, we saw the price rise, as I said a moment ago, from those sub-400c levels up to its peak in May of this year of a reasonably respectable 800c a kilo-plus sort of level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, as I have already mentioned, in terms of Wool International's activities there have been some concerns. There is no doubt that&mdash;just as any stockpile sales will depress the market, even in a rising market&mdash;restricting the amount of wool coming onto the market helped to secure confidence and did not see the market dampened by the flooding of wool onto it out of the stockpile. Unfortunately, in a falling market, it continues to have that depressing effect but it becomes much more marked, and the issue of the actual mechanisms involved in the sale of wool becomes much more controversial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we find that, indeed, there has been an unfortunate amount of speculation about the activities of Wool International in the sense that, whilst I understand there have been some concerns&mdash;and I have shared some of those concerns and have talked to Wool International about them and will continue to talk to Wool International about them&mdash;the idea of public speculation, public disagreement, I suspect, has been very unhelpful in some of its more extreme forms. I think the industry needs to think long and hard about that particular aspect of the industry as it exists in 1999. I suspect that other industries with similar difficulties would be much more careful about their public airing of those difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to make is this: it needs to be remembered that it is not as though Wool International is putting vast amounts of wool onto the market. In fact, if you looked at the declining fresh wool supply, you would see that we are actually well below what the marketplace might reasonably have been expected to absorb. That, in itself, is quite concerning&mdash;although it does highlight one point: the relatively modest amount of wool being placed on the market by Wool International is far from the problem and, even if it were not there, one suspects that the market would be facing problems of an almost similar magnitude to those we are now facing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade is now speculating that the 1995-96 clip&mdash;forecast to be just 640 million kilograms&mdash;may now be even lower, at around 580 million kilograms, while another 130 million kilograms will be sold from the stockpile under the fixed reduction schedule managed by Wool International. That underlines my point that the total volume of wool coming onto the market is well below what any of us might reasonably have assumed the market would have been prepared to purchase at reasonable prices. To put it another way, the market might have been at a level where supply and demand factors would have been such as to guarantee reasonably firm and acceptable values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking obviously at some broader problems. Just briefly, the generally weak demand for wool in the key markets of Europe and Japan and the continuing absence of Australia's biggest customer of recent years&mdash;that is, China&mdash;from the auction room are the key factors behind the price collapse. However, the market is expected to turn around as the trade begins to look seriously at the supply outlook and realise that there simply will not be as much wool around next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this serves to highlight one problem that I want to look at for a moment&mdash;that is, the inadequate development of selling options available to wool growers. I have to say that, to date, the industry has developed these alternative mechanisms at a very slow pace, despite the obvious need for them. In virtually any other industry, growers would have locked at least a proportion of their production into forward contracts. I think, by any agreement, that would have offered growers the option of significantly reducing their exposure to the current downturn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know it is often said that there are differences between the industries and so forth. Nonetheless, the fact is that cotton growers do it and grain growers do it. I am a grain grower. I have locked in a considerable amount of my production this year. There is always an element of risk in that but, in my assessment, there is an even greater risk in not going down that road. I have forward sold a reasonable amount of my grain, which we started doing as early as June this year. We do this because it makes, on balance, good sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem for wool growers is that their options are not as freely available or as well understood and developed as they might be. A bit of prodding is needed, a fact that was widely acknowledged when Wool International was created two years ago. Perhaps this unfortunate reminder of the vulnerability of being substantially locked into one selling system might kick the progress along a bit further. The availability of forward contracting is widespread at every level of the wool industry, except at the farm gate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a responsibility incumbent upon those in the trade, in very blunt and simple terms, to fix the problems. Therefore, I issue a challenge to the players&mdash;the brokers, the buyers and the exporters&mdash;to get in there, have a go at this and make things happen. Growers need better access to forward selling mechanisms. It is not in the interests of anyone in the wool industry for growers to be left to the wolves&mdash;to the vagaries of the spot market&mdash;on the salesroom floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be realistic about this&mdash;in the absence of any statutory arrangements for price stabilisation, it is up to the industry and the private sector to develop mechanisms that allow growers to plan ahead, budget and rule out that extraordinary volatility. I suppose you could say that that volatility is usually the vehicle that drives the development of marketplace mechanisms to hedge and smooth out price volatility. Let us hope in this case that these mechanisms start to develop a bit quicker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also has to be said, in fairness to the rest of the industry, that if there is no certainty for growers there is no certainty for anybody else in the wool trade. The industry's middle men may like a system in which growers take all the risk but in a free market that is unsustainable. There is a clear message for all players&mdash;change or perish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the present crisis, I want to stress a point made very succinctly and very importantly last week by Charles Armstrong, the President of the Wool Council of Australia, when he said that the trade had to recognise that the wool supply is dwindling. It is, of course, ultimately responsive to market supply and demand signals. Mr Armstrong&mdash;I do not think I can overemphasise the importance of this&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sooner or later processors have got to realise that if they want to keep machinery running they are going to have to start sending some signals to growers to start producing some more wool.</PARA>
<PARA>An end to industry infighting and a return to the market by buyers waiting to see how far the price will slump would be a very good start to restoring the industry and its confidence. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the House and emphasise that the coalition will be opposing the bills before us this morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Primary industry in Australia has moved in a very interesting way over the last century. The first member for Eden-Monaro&mdash;Sir Austin Chapman, a racehorse breeder and hotel owner who lived in Braidwood, which is still in the electorate&mdash;was a member of the protectionist party. It is hard to imagine a member of the protectionist party being elected, but, as I recall, he was a member for 21 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a very strong attitude of protectionism there was a move to what was called orderly marketing. That was a very good way of government trying to get some order into some very big problems that existed in primary industry. Nevertheless, orderly marketing was not the end to advancement in primary industry. I can recall wheat being raffled by the local branch of the Labor Party in Nhill, where I once lived. The wheat was being sold over the state border so that it could avoid the orderly marketing procedures at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then many farmers and farming industries&mdash;the farming organisations well before many of the farmers&mdash;moved to a free trade attitude. I can recall only a couple of years ago an old farmer coming to see me, suggesting that Australia should forget about worrying about overseas markets and should try to sell its produce in Australia. He was a wool grower. I pointed out that Australia uses no more than two per cent of the total wool clip so we cannot avoid taking into full account our overseas markets. We have a very strong relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present time we sell to Asia a total of $14 billion more in goods than it sells to us, but we still have a long way to go. We can add value to our primary products. As our colleague the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) often suggests, we should talk about import replacement. There is plenty that we could be doing here that we are not doing. There is a long way to go. None of the previous answers&mdash;protectionism, orderly marketing or free trade&mdash;are the complete picture if we want to do our best and maximise job opportunities and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our primary industries have a pretty good record of productivity and for that reason I can understand why governments are often exhorted to reduce government interference and to have a policy whereby government can leave as much as possible to industry. But when we look at the items we are dealing with&mdash;levies and charges&mdash;we can understand why there is government involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that government has said to industry, `Look, you raise your own funds. If you want to levy people, do it yourselves and leave us out of it.' Of course, industry has said, `Well, there are some people in our industry who will not cooperate unless you actually pass legislation that will put these levies and charges in place.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has said, `All right, we will do that, but we will appoint a body to administer these levies and charges.' So we have the various industry bodies that have been appointed to do just that. But still there are problems; there are people for whom levies are not suitable and there are people who do not want to be involved with them. There are others that it does suit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, in the meat industry, people have gone so far as to take legal action to try to avoid levies, even though their industry has promoted the idea. There is much we can do in individual production areas in primary industry, and I will refer to four or five of those areas in the electorate of Eden-Monaro where there is government involvement but where we can still do more, and also where we can do less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of beef production and beef exports, we have a potential to develop markets, particularly in Korea and Japan. We also have the potential to improve productivity in Australia by having more efficiency in our meat inspection system. I believe this is the way we ought to move to develop our beef policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson) has talked about the need to keep up our production of wool. That is a very important point because, as we found in the mohair industry, once the mills stop producing a particular product and divert to something else&mdash;whether it is man-made or animal fibre&mdash;it takes a while for the producer to get back to producing the fibre that they were originally producing. So it is very important that we look at that delicate matter of getting wool production right so that we can keep mills around the world wanting this still outstanding fibre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must also make sure that, as the government gets out of the activity, there is a proper say for farmers. For instance, we need to ensure that, if Wool International is privatised, farmers will have a say in what happens. I welcome the actions of the farm organisations. In the electorate of Eden-Monaro the New South Wales Farmers Association has been moving around talking to farmers about the alternatives available to them with a privatised Wool International, and people have been able to have their say. Unfortunately, for some years the New South Wales Farmers Association was seen as a politically biased organisation; farmers started to fall away from it as they lacked faith in the organisation. Now I can say that the New South Wales Farmers Association is genuinely getting around to get the views of all farmers. It will increase its membership if it gives farmers and other people a say and takes an attitude which is perhaps less partisan politically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry is another industry which has supported the idea of levies and charges, which is what this legislation is about. They also need to be given a say, as they are regularly given a say through Ausdairy. Pat Riley, the head of the dairy industry, was on television just this week saying that the dairy industry was very dependent on the success of the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude, there are other commodities produced in the electorate which I ought to mention briefly. In the fishing industry we have the old-fashioned system of people carrying on common farming and going out, almost in a nomadic fashion, hunting and gathering, one could say, in the different sectors of the fishing industry. We have quotas, government involvement and interference. There needs to be more flexibility here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to that quota distribution, for instance, I know that the government is giving sympathetic consideration this year to representations from the tuna industry, which is saying that it has not been able to catch fish and yet it has a deadline of the end of October to catch its quota for the end of this year. I am pleased that the government are considering extending that deadline. I have made representations that they extend the deadline to the end of November and that the new year start on 1 December. I hope that happens. I am urging the minister to allow that to happen so that the tuna industry can take advantage of the stocks that are moving around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also welcome the fact that the United Nations has now come to some agreement with a whole range of countries. I believe that about 37 countries will probably, by the end of the year, have ratified an agreement on southern bluefin tuna conservation. It is true that the tuna industry has been harmed by some countries&mdash;Indonesia, Taiwan, Korea&mdash;that have not been involved in any agreement in fishing stock, and overfishing stock in some cases. Then those countries are involved with another country which is involved in the agreement and which appears to be taking some of their fish; that is, Japan. So there is now agreement through the United Nations which I hope will bind all those countries, although Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations at this stage, unfortunately. I hope those countries will come to agreement so that the tuna industry is approached with that very important condition that there be a quota set by the various countries involved in fishing southern bluefin tuna. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay full credit to the commercial fisheries and, in particular in the electorate of Eden-Monaro, to Ron Snape, who has spearheaded a claim on government that we ought to be taking action against other countries when we are putting restrictions on our own people in the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I briefly mention the timber industry. It is extremely important that reserve forest agreements come as soon as possible. It is extremely important that we abide by the national forest policy. It is extremely important that we say to the environmental groups where we draw the line, even though they continually say, `No. We will not come to any conclusive agreement with anyone because we never know what new agenda might come up.' With all these industries we can have a prosperous region, which includes the ACT and south-western New South Wales, if we get it right. I believe that efficiency in each of these industries is high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just learned at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference that recent satellite pictures taken of the world show that Australia looks more green than any other country. This is astonishing when you consider what the countries of the world were like when satellites started going around not so very many years ago. It was about 35 years ago that satellites started taking pictures of the world and it was a much greener world then. But Australia is holding its own. We need to remind people about this when they are talking about our timber industry. We need to remind people that we are importing a huge amount of timber and will import even more as we restrict production here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that the farm organisations, particularly the National Farmers Federation, pursue a multipartisan approach within this parliament. I believe part of the reason they have been able to get agreement with government is that the government has a lot of rural members within it&mdash;many of them with a fairly independent streak who are prepared to speak out for primary industries, and many of them who are prepared to listen to the people in their electorates and bring the view here to government. I believe we ought to support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This primary industries legislation is legislation which, as our shadow minister for primary industries, the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson), has clearly indicated, the coalition opposes. One of the reasons we oppose it was just demonstrated by the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). Legislation of this nature has frequently created the opportunity for the sort of wide ranging debate the member for Eden-Monaro was able to indulge in with no objection. I think it is one of the few opportunities that people who represent electorates with rural interests have to make contributions of this nature which, hopefully, will be helpful to the people of their electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that we are gradually streamlining this parliament out of existence. Clearly, legislation that imposes what is technically at least a tax should have exposure in this parliament and should give opportunities to members to discuss the issues and possibly represent the arguments of their constituents which might be in conflict&mdash;and I want to go further on this subject&mdash;with those of their so-called farmer representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a very peculiar view of the word `industry' in this parliament. We think it is the Wool Council or the Grains Council or one of the major farmer organisations. It is my own understanding&mdash;and the evidence that comes to me is legion&mdash;that quite frequently the people out there who produce the grain and produce the wool and produce these other commodities do not necessarily support the views that are expounded by the half a dozen or so who claim to be the `industry' in those terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that some commodity group secretary cannot just pick up the phone and say to the minister for agriculture or primary industry or whatever, `Listen, we want you to put another couple of cents or one or two per cent on this particular commodity.' It is appropriate that those matters come to the parliament for debate. You might say to me, `There is always the disallowance power in regulations.' That is a negative approach, not a positive approach. For instance, someone might want to stand up in this place and say the levy is not enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, and notwithstanding there are about 59 separate pieces of legislation associated with this so-called streamlining, the facts are that when the legislation is brought in, as we all know, the levy&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;is usually set substantially higher than what is required immediately. Regulations are then provided for in that legislation to crank it up to that top figure, but at least the parliament has approved that top figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see no need for this legislation. In fact, I have concerns that it is a mechanism to allow a very limited number of people to come forward and start taxing their fellow producers. Many of them, as we know in this day and age of the Canberra lobby, are not producers at all&mdash;the ones who pick up the phone and ask for the levy to be increased. They might be the recipient of some of that levy by way of their salary. They are frequently people with academic backgrounds, et cetera, who are hired to run the various lobby groups, or whatever their label might be here in Canberra. They are not primary producers. They seldom consult the wider industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Primary Industries Charges Bill 1995 and the Primary Industries Levies Bill 1995 tend to replace 59 separate levy and charge acts for a variety of primary industry products and allow the operative rates of those charges to be set by regulation specific to each industry or product, as is the case at present. My first point is that there is nothing wrong with that process. My second point is that we created the Main Committee. I can see myself standing up in this parliament supporting the government initiative of the Main Committee on the grounds that it was to be used for classic bills which frequently had quite long speakers lists but which were nevertheless not opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But people wanted to speak because it was the pig levy bill or the wheat levy bill or something and they wanted the opportunity to represent the interests of their constituents on that issue. As was the case with the member for Eden-Monaro, nobody jumped up and took a point of order and said he was not relevant to the legislation. It has been a convention of this place that on those pieces of legislation there can be a wide ranging debate and the participants are usually from both sides of the House. Why knock that opportunity out? It is silly. In a disallowance you cannot do that; you cannot make those positive contributions. You could not certainly, in trying to disallow some levy on wheat, make some references to the tuna industry, as the member for Eden-Monaro just did and to which I have no objection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Farm Journal </EMPHASIS>of October 1994 ran this headline on its cover&mdash;`Farm levies: The 750m tax `grab'.' That particular grab extends somewhat past the particular issues of promotion and research that we are dealing with today. What did it say in that article? It said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian farmers were taxed $750 million&mdash;an average of $5,000 each&mdash;last financial year to fund the multitude of statutory bodies that control rural marketing, promotion, research and export inspection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it's little wonder that some farmers are trying to hack away this costly Federal Government bureaucracy that has flourished despite the decline in farm profits. Major rural commodities such as wool, beef and wheat are knee-deep in statutory bodies, each sucking tax from farming incomes. Woolgrowers, most with the backsides out of their trousers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and those who got them stitched up a year or so ago are now seeing them being torn apart again&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">paid $216 million in 1993-94 to fund a wool bureaucracy even though wool marketing is now completely deregulated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FARMERS TO BLAME: But farmers largely have themselves to blame for this large-scale bureaucratic intrusion into their lives and bottom lines.</PARA>
<PARA>I have just made the point and I would like to repeat it. I am not sure that individual farmers are the ones who have been asking for many of these levies, nor are they too keen to pay them. They are simply not consulted. I will give a classic example relating to these commodity groups&mdash;these so-called farmers' representatives. I noticed in correspondence I received from Victoria the other day that they call themselves the voice of the wheat and meat industry. I will tell you about their voice. These various farmer groups went off to get a briefing from Wool International. They are the people who would be demanding these increases by adding these increases by regulation. Before they were allowed in the front door they voluntarily signed confidentiality agreements stating that they would not come out and tell their constituents what they were told in there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who is Wool International? It is a statutory body created by legislation of this place. It could be considered a government institution, but it is conducting the affairs of wool growers. It has the temerity to try to ambush its own constituency and sit down and make plans behind closed doors, which it knows very well the general wool growing community does not want to have a bar of. I am talking of some private company arbitrarily funded by wool growers' money that is to be used to give some very cushy jobs and possibly substantial financial profit to a few people who currently have the job of disposing of the wool stockpile. Why would these people believe that anything they are doing or thinking about should be held under a confidentiality agreement? Any information emanating from that place is the property of the wool growers of Australia. We should not see this sort of performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I received a letter from Rod Thirkell-Johnston, President of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, who reckons it is a great idea to keep his members in the dark. I got a similar letter from Victoria. If I had it with me, I would quote that name too. I find it totally outrageous that so-called representatives of the rural industry believe that they are entitled to conduct negotiations behind closed doors on matters directly affecting the future welfare of wool  growers and keep them a secret. You wait till you have got all you guns loaded and then you pull your poor constituents out and shoot them down. The same thing is going on with the wheat industry fund and the Australian Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position of the coalition is that the Wheat Board can remain as a statutory authority and conduct the business of wheat growers in the export market&mdash;and I guess in the local market, although I believe that that has not been beneficial to grain growers. But, putting that aside, our policy is not only that the AWB will survive in its present form but also that we will continue to give it loan guarantees of advance harvest payments prior to the sale of grain of up to 95 per cent of the international price of that grain. That is our position, and that is quite acceptable to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very people who run the Wheat Board are telling farmers that it has got to be privatised, but only on one condition: that they get the sole monopoly to manage the single desk operation of all wheat exports within Australia. Why would you give a private company that responsibility? I think the Wheat Board is a very interesting example. To me, years and years ago, the Wheat Board was not a company; it was not a seller of wheat. It was the grounds upon which I got the guaranteed minimum price for my grain. It was the body which handled the single desk operation. Of course, we have seen the guaranteed minimum price whittle away; it does not exist in the form that it did. Under the previous formula, back in February and March, a grower could sit down at the kitchen table and draw up a budget for his bank manager. He was able to say, `If I harvest this much wheat, this is the price I'll get for it, irrespective of the world market.' That formula also reflected the world market so that it did not distort planning intentions. That was a good formula. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wheat growers are now being told that in order to protect the single desk operation, which is the only good thing left about the Wheat Board in its present form, they have got to put $500 million of their own money into shares to keep the Wheat Board alive. This is the only way the Wheat Board will have enough money to pay them a first advance. But it is not paying them a first advance; they are paying their own first advance. Furthermore, that money could be lost because those who currently run the Wheat Board want to expand their business activities into some very dangerous areas. A little while ago they were trying to buy Graincorp in Queensland. One of their intentions was to go into lot feeding. What a nice place that would be to invest shareholders' money at the moment. These are the things that wheat growers do not want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the wheat growers do not like having to pay the WIF levy, which to many represents something like 125 per cent of their net returns. There are wheat growers in the electorate of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) whose WIF levy is more than their net return. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Farm Journal</EMPHASIS> mentioned the fact that these levies add up to substantial amounts of money when they are measured against the net farming return, not the gross farming return. Let me run through who pays what levies according to that article: wool growers, $216 million; dairy farmers, $160 million; AQIS, $140 million; grain growers, $66 million&mdash;that amount would probably be covered in this legislation; beef producers, $57 million; sheep meat producers, $25 million; pig farmers, $11 million; fruit and vegetable growers, $10 million&mdash;that is an absolute dog's breakfast; cotton growers, $4 million; sugar producers, $3 million; and poultry producers, $1.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are trying to bring in something that, for all intents and purposes, is going to hide this process from parliament. We all know how these particular levies and disallowance motions work. There is no formal announcement that certain regulations are being brought before the parliament. Most members of parliament, unless they study the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> assiduously, unless they understand what the actual levy proposal is or unless they get a phone call from someone saying, `We have just come to discover that a new levy is going to be added on some particular rural commodity and we would like you to oppose it,' do not even know that they are there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us compare that with the parliamentary debate we are having at the moment. We are properly notified of it. There are first reading speeches, second reading speeches and explanatory memorandums, and we get the opportunity to come in here, make a contribution and support or oppose it. The parliament, through the creation of the Main Committee, has plenty of time to do these exercises, even if they are supported by both sides and there is no opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems we have is that these so-called industry groups have started to get the feeling that it is not so easy to con their constituencies into these levy increases, that people have had enough of them, and it is they that are demanding of government that a mechanism be put in place so that the operation is not as transparent as it used to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the mechanism. They call it `streamlining'. I have never, in 15 years of membership of this place, perceived any great difficulty in dealing with these matters. I frequently contribute. I make sure, as did the member for Eden-Monaro a few minutes ago, that I take the opportunity to raise some of the broader issues&mdash;which my constituents welcome&mdash;which gives the opportunity for issues to be considered in the wider community. It is an opportunity to achieve change. We all know, particularly backbenchers, that you do not get the opportunity to stand up in the parliament and propose motions on different issues. This is a great opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, the legislation is unnecessary. The parliament does have the time to debate these matters. It is right and proper that the matter should be dealt with by legislation, particularly when it has never been the case that we come in here and add every half a cent, or whatever, by a new piece of legislation. Time and again it comes in and is presented as a 5c levy, of which 2c is to be used immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got the streamlining at an adequate level, and it is wrong of members of parliament to vote to support to hide the processes of government in this manner. It would be interesting to see how much thought the caucus gave to this issue in terms of either need or propriety of this measure. But I do. I think it is all around us, and I am an open critic of the performance these days of so many of the commodity councils and farmer organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw them come out through their bureaucracies at the NFF and attack the coalition when it suggested that we should reinstate the fodder subsidy. We saw that stop dead in its tracks. What was the outcome? The government had its own inquiry as to the adequacy of its measures. What did the inquiry come out and say? `You should have had a fodder subsidy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has only to go back to the history of the Fraser fodder subsidy. Yes, we had some problems with some people abusing the process, but there were thousands of beneficiaries, and one of the greatest happened to be the Hawke Labor government. It inherited the rain after that particular drought. Of course, that is referred to as bad economic management. This drought is a drought. The last one in 1982-83 was bad economic management. They were both droughts, of course, and they had similar effects. The simple fact is that, because Fraser had protected the breeding flocks through his fodder subsidy, when it rained there was an immediate expansion in the breeding program and everything got back to normal. This time, as we know, it is going to take a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is another example of how the various farmer organisations are losing their way in representing the interests of the rural community. It is not appropriate that we give them another measure to tax their own constituents without the proper scrutiny of this parliament. As I say, this is not the only occasion on which this has occurred. We see it all the time. We see question time being abused through the roster process, and everywhere you look in this parliament we are being streamlined out of existence. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My office tells me that today is my 15th birthday as a member of parliament. It is a fact I have not checked; it is depressing enough just to be told it. With regard to the Primary Industries Levies Bill and cognate bills, I have to say that I actually agree with some of the comments by the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I certainly agree more with what he said than with what the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) said. He came in here in his usual style, which I think is best described as eloquent waffle, and very quickly moved from the bill itself to a very wide ranging discussion on the wool industry. I note that the member for O'Connor chided the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) for doing that. The truth is that you cannot speak for more than two minutes on this bill because there is not really a lot to discuss, so I think it is important that we have a wide ranging discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that we are inhibiting the discussion of agricultural problems by taking this measure to amalgamate 59 separate levies into one bill is fully absurd. I point out to members that the things we have inflicted on the industry were all done under the process which they now say is so vital and which they are now making an act of principle in order to try to maintain it. Clearly, it is just plain nonsense. I do not think this legislation is particularly important legislation. It certainly will not have the dire consequences that the opposition talks about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Gwydir told us that he was opposing it. Having listened carefully to him, I still do not know why he is opposing it. What he said certainly made no sense. I believe this bill will have a beneficial impact if it starts to get growers in Australia to take a genuine interest in their industry and start to fight for their industry. So many times, growers have taken the attitude that they will just do their little bit&mdash;they will grow the product and what happens to it is not their concern. I know that in the wool industry in particular the level of information that growers had about their industry was simply appalling. I add that the level of information that their so-called representatives had was often equally appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are looking at here is a power to legislate to collect levies or taxes on an industry. I believe, as the member for O'Connor does, that too often the industry itself does not know the full ramifications of the levies and charges raised against it. But that is a problem that the industry has to face. There must be a lot more discussion within the industry. It is absurd to say we are going to advance that simply by having this debate in the parliament when, as the member for O'Connor has already said, the present legislation in most cases allows for changes in the tax level to be done by regulation in any case. There is just no internal consistency in their argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that we find ourselves talking for 20 minutes or so on this piece of legislation today simply to fill in time. However, it does, as the member for O'Connor pointed out, give an opportunity for members to raise concerns about the industry. I listened to the member for Gwydir. I have never heard, quite frankly, so much agro-socialist drivel. He came in here, as he does, and said most piously that everybody in the wool industry should be taking action to ensure that wool growers are looked after. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one group that has the responsibility for looking after wool growers, and that is wool growers. They can do this. They have to recognise what their industry is about. When I was a wool grower in the early 1970s I actively supported the Wool Board very strongly in the establishment of a guaranteed price. I now realise that I was mistaken. However, in the early days, when the board was pitching its price at a cost something below the average cost of production, it probably did not do a great deal of harm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Gwydir seems to think that growers must have some guarantee of returns. This is not the problem for wool growers at all. It is not the occasional bad sales that affect wool growers. It is the continual application of prices that are only marginally above their cost of production over a long time. That is what destroys the wool industry. That is what takes the incentive out of it. That is what makes it impossible to find the capital to keep their infrastructure in place and up to scratch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the price of wool in 1986 terms, we see that it has cycled through 700c, 2 1/2 times every 10 years, and it has done that for as long as records have been kept. In the good years, that has enabled growers to get the benefit of these higher returns and to refurbish their infrastructure. Holding the price at a lower level for a prolonged time has simply denied that. Many growers have now come to realise that that is the case. I have heard growers say, and this has been said to me on many occasions, `This is outrageous! Myers or David Jones make more money out of my wool than I do.' Of course they do. They have a lot more money invested in the farmers' wool than the farmer does, so of course they are going to be seeking greater returns from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have any philosophical commitment to free trade. In fact, I have argued very strongly against it and, in some circumstances, I would argue that it simply does not exist. In reality, there is no such thing as a level playing field. But there are clearly some industries which are better served by a free market approach than they are by regulation, and I submit that wool is one of those markets. That is because the product is a unique product for Australia. It is, in a sense, the only product we have which has any form of uniqueness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We control a very significant part of the garment fibre market throughout the world, but what do we see happening? We see an inability to recognise the advantages we have&mdash;the enormous advantages we have from 150 years of luck and 150 years of selective breeding&mdash;to develop this unique fibre, which is not just wool but merino wool. We are busily giving it away. I cannot think of anything more crazy. This is going to do far more damage to the industry than how these levies here are implemented, yet is there any discussion? Yes, there is discussion. If you go out and talk to farmers you find that, overwhelmingly, they want it stopped&mdash;and stopped immediately and completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year I spent some time talking to stud growers in New Zealand. It is quite obvious that New Zealand has a well-established fine wool business. It is quite pointless Australia stopping the supply of genetic material if New Zealand is going to continue to do it. I found overwhelming support from the stud breeders in New Zealand who said, `Look, the only reason we are doing it is that it is legal and, if we don't, somebody else will. But we would like to stop it. We recognise the long-term danger that this poses to Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about wool dwindling. Wool production in Australia is dwindling and will continue to dwindle while the returns on wool are as they are. But that is not necessarily the case overseas. China is seeking&mdash;and remember that China is presently our biggest customer&mdash;to upgrade its wool so that it is more useful for export garments. How do they do that? The quickest way is to buy Australian genetic material. It is clearly not in our interests to help them do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told by the economists that the Australian merino is a product of the cost of land in Australia and the climate. Obviously that has been a factor. But these situations are duplicated in many other parts of the world. The cost of land in some eastern European countries is now cheaper than much more inferior land in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Italians, who are certainly no fools in the wool business, are taking renewed interest in South America. I notice that the flocks have had a bit of a bashing in South America in recent times, but they are going to expand again. With Italian technology, or the use of Australian technology by the Italians, you can expect to see a rapid increase in the quality of South American wool, undermining once more our market niche in the world. Yet we are told that this legislation denies primary producers an opportunity to have things discussed. The truth is that we do not listen to them anyway. We never did. On serious issues, they are ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I actually brought into my caucus a motion to ban the export of merino genetic material. After a lot of trouble and going through all the due forms of the caucus I got it through the caucus, only to have the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) come in and overturn it. Obviously he was advised by people from Wool International and the Wool Council, which, as the member for O'Connor has acknowledged, simply do not represent wool growers. You see this in many other areas as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that this legislation is going to make that problem worse is simply nonsense. It is a device which tidies up the existing legislation. It saves some time in this House, although I do not think that is of great importance nor the main reason for its introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at the long-term future of primary industries. What is happening? Let us take the timber industry as an example. The member for Eden-Monaro is absolutely right: the truth of the matter is&mdash;and this ought to be rammed down the throat of every man, woman and child in this land&mdash;that Australia has arguably the best forest management in the world. Western Australia probably has the best of that, although Tasmania is also very good. There has not been one single acre of land lost to forestry. Forestry has not caused the demise of one single acre of the forest. The forest land lost has been lost to industry and overwhelmingly to farming. Forestry has always sought to restore the land that it cuts because that is its very lifeblood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that when you hamper or hinder the forest industry in Australia you drive it offshore to countries where there are no environmental standards. That has to be recognised and that ought to be drummed into the head of every school child in Australia, instead of feeding them the sloppy mixture of green lies that seem to be a substantial part of school diets today&mdash;and it is certainly an indictment on primary school teachers. This is where lies the great danger to Australia's national interest, particularly to the interests of rural producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the timber industry we have a $2 billion a year deficit. We import $2 billion of timber products which we could easily produce in this country. We could easily produce more and more and have it as a net exporter. It is a substantial industry. When you close it down, you close it down in areas where there is no alternative. So you turn thriving rural communities with a work ethic into communities simply of recipients of social security where the work ethic is quickly destroyed and pride is taken over by despondency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the sort of Australia I want but that is the sort of Australia that is happening. It is happening not because of this sort of legislation but because we are not listening to what producers are saying&mdash;and we are, in fact, distorting the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My mind goes back to 1974 when I approached leading people in the environmental movement in Western Australia with a view to getting some interest in soil erosion salinity. It is now the most important environmental problem. I was told not to worry about erosion&mdash;`Nobody goes out to look at erosion on the weekend. Get with the trees; that's where the power is.' The forest debate has never been about the environment; it has always been about power&mdash;and that should have been recognised. But those are the sorts of things that are tearing at the fabric of rural Australia. </PARA>

He said that, if every city in America were destroyed, rural America would rebuild them; but if rural America were destroyed, it would be passed over by grass. That is true of America, but it is even more true of this nation&mdash;and that is not recognised. The truth is that both political parties know that if they win big in Melbourne and Sydney the rest of the country really does not matter. If you ask yourself, `What do Melbourne and Sydney actually produce?' the answer is, `Not very much.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge opposition members to think about their position and to support this legislation. It is not legislation of great consequence. It certainly will not have the dire consequence they are talking about. It does streamline proceedings and it may have a beneficial consequence in that it may force farmers, rural producers, to take a real interest in and have real discussion about their own industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I just want to say that what we ought to be discussing and looking at in this parliament is how to deal with the recurring problem of drought. It was said by the member for O'Connor that feed subsidies are the answer. Feed subsidies are not the answer.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to have a look at income equalisation. We need to have a form of income equalisation that really does benefit farmers so that they can take responsibility for their own future, just as in wool. Wool futures are a very useful tool. But they are not a tool for gambling; they are a tool for individual farmers to protect their income. If you leave those wool futures in the hands of an organised body, it will not be able to resist using them for gambling, and that is what they will become. They are a tool not for making the quick quid but for guaranteeing a level of desired income. That can and should best be done by farmers. If the farmer himself does not feel capable, he should go and see a broker. If that broker's performance is not satisfactory, the farmer should simply sack him and try someone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Income equalisation bonds that really do give farmers the ability to utilise their good seasons, instead of paying their income off in taxes and the next year becoming recipients of government grants, would be by far the best way to do it. But it cannot be done overnight. Given the cyclic nature of the seasons in Australia, I think what you have to say is, `In five years time this will be the rule, but in the meantime we are starting today with the process'&mdash;just as we did with gold producers. We said to gold producers in 1986, `We're going to tax you. We're going to apply the company tax regime to you. We won't do it until 1 January 1991 but, until that time, you can claim all your expenditure as deductions.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of thing we ought to be providing to farmers. If we did that, it would protect the breeding stocks far more than the proposal put forward and lauded by the member for O'Connor. I would certainly urge the government to look at this in respect of protecting the beef herd. Once again, I will be putting to the Treasury a scheme which I believe will provide protection for the beef herd&mdash;protection which is absolutely necessary for the wellbeing not only of industry but, in my view, of the nation as a whole. </PARA>

Simply put, it is based on the fact that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills identified problems. The main problem was that a dangerous practice was involved in allowing ministers to effectively become responsible for setting the level of taxes. That is the basis of our opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal to have a single framework for 59 separate levies and charges, which are currently imposed on primary industry products, on the face of it may appear to have some merit. But, based on the Senate committee, the opposition cannot support the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That said, I think there is a deeper reality about agriculture in our country. We wax lyrical in this place regularly, but we cannot deny our past and the fact that for 200 years agriculture has been predominant in the growth of this country as a trading nation, in our history, our culture and our economics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something we have never come to terms with particularly well is the great variation that exists. I suppose it has something to do with distance and our urban based population. But there is not a very good understanding of that great variation. For instance, we see negative pictures of the drought. We see the stark pictures of dying or dead stock and crops that did not come to fruition, but we do not think about it any further. The extent of our interest these days is a 30-second news grab on the television screen, and that's it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fundamental thing has affected the very basis of our nation. I can demonstrate that as simply as I can by saying that 37 of the 147 seats in the House of Representatives represent those with the lowest income in this country and all but two of those are in regional Australia. It was even more remarkable to me when I realised that of those bottom 37 seats, in terms of income, nearly three-quarters were represented by the coalition. The true low income people of Australia are represented by the coalition and come from regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is in Australia what I would call an urban dominant culture. The challenge lies in dealing with what can be described as the national schizophrenia; that is, this nation's schizophrenia and its inability to recognise, on the one hand, a CPI economy&mdash;which these levies and charges no doubt reflect in many cases, when there is a CPI increase&mdash;and, on the other, the productive base of agriculture. This huge variation which I have spoken about in this place on many occasions can, when you combine yield and price, have a factor of 10. You imagine your income is $10 per hour one day and $100 per hour the next day. It is more likely to be $10 at tops and a dollar in a drought, if you want to make comparisons. In other words, a variation of 10 at least is the factor to remember. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a huge dynamic which we as a nation do not really understand. I guess most of us do not care because, after all, most of us are on CPI-linked salaries. It is one of the most remarkable experiences for me to come to this place and be on a very good salary and see that salary increase in line with the CPI. I must confess that I am somewhat embarrassed by it when I consider the industry I have come from. It does not recognise that huge impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another impact on the CPI and agricultural costs is the famous fuel excise that the government collects so much revenue from&mdash;$10 billion in the current financial year. When this government came to office there was a collection of about $1.4 billion, but that was only part of the story. Import parity pricing was then the order of the day. When the price of oil dropped on the international market, the government said, `We cannot do without that revenue so we will get it through excise.' In one go, the Labor government of the day said, `Sorry, we believe in the level playing field, we believe in the international marketplace, we believe you should get only what you can get for your commodity from the international market, but we have to ignore the cost side because we need the revenue.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember that in production, in small business, all indirect taxation comes off the top&mdash;it comes before people make a profit, before they make a living. That is the inequity. And what does that lead to? It leads to depopulation. People, particularly in metropolitan areas, are saying that much of regional Australia will be depopulated as generations go by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that very hard to accept, and I give my electorate of Grey as an example. Fifty per cent of South Australia's exports come out of my electorate yet it ranks in the bottom 10 per cent of electorates by income. It has double the number of social security beneficiaries. It has 50 per cent above the national unemployment rate. So there are some key issues for me in the divide between metropolitan and rural and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) touched on IEDs, the income equalisation deposits. He acknowledged that he had been here for something like 15 years. I wish he had been a little more persuasive with ex-Senator Peter Walsh 10 years ago when this current Labor government abolished that very mechanism. I can only agree with the sentiments he expressed about the drought. The whole premise of my case today is that there is a strong ignorance of the huge variation within agriculture in our country. But all we see are those 30-second grabs on television. We do not acknowledge the long-term impact of depopulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give another example. Whyalla, which is in my electorate, is the largest regional city in South Australia. It has seen a depopulation over the last 10 or 15 years from something like 34,000 or 35,000 down to 25,000 or 26,000. You might say, `That is a BHP, steel industry, secondary industry type of city. Whyalla is about shipbuilding; it has nothing to do with agriculture.' The reality is that it has quite a lot to do with agriculture. Much of the economy of Whyalla and the surrounding towns is dependent upon agriculture. There is the old story that it was the cockies forced off their land during the Depression who very much helped to build the modern steel industry at Whyalla.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constant complaint about my nation and this parliament is that there is insufficient recognition of the dominant urban culture and its effect on regional Australia. The biggest export producers have the smallest incomes&mdash;yet there used to be debate in this country about distribution of wealth!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that there will always be great variation in agriculture. But the reality is that to this point we have not come to terms with how we stop our urban sprawl and the unwise investment in that urban sprawl, and how we might build our regions and at least use&mdash;I have mentioned the case of Whyalla&mdash;the existing infrastructure. Whilst there is always some schizophrenia in politics, there is a great challenge for us to come up with policies which are more devoid of this schizophrenia which says that CPI is okay for those of us who are going all right but it is no good for those of us who happen to work in international market commodity areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we oppose this legislation, but predominantly for the machinery reasons that we do not think it is appropriate for ministers to become responsible for setting the level of taxes by regulation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill 1995 will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of the comprehensive double taxation agreement between Australia and the Czech Republic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill 1995, as the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has indicated, gives the force of law in Australia to a comprehensive double tax agreement signed with the Czech Republic on 28 March 1995 for the prevention of double taxation and the prevention of avoidance of taxes on income flows between the treaty partners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement prevents double taxation by allocating taxing rights to Australia or the Czech Republic on all forms of income flows between the two countries. The basis of allocating the rights is substantially similar to that adopted in Australia's other modern double taxation agreements such as that with New Zealand earlier this year. The agreement affects all taxpayers who, for the purposes of the double tax agreement, are residents of either Australia or the Czech Republic and who derive income, profits or gains from the other country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The double tax agreement applies to Australian income tax and resource rent tax in respect of offshore petroleum products. It does not extend to sales tax, fringe benefits tax, wool tax and levies, customs duties, state taxes and duties and the Medicare levy. It applies to taxes on income in the Czech Republic. The agreement will automatically extend to any identical or substantially similar taxes which are subsequently imposed by either country in addition to or in the place of existing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without going in great detail to the mechanism which is provided in the bill, the special features of the agreement relate to dividend withholding tax, interest on royalties, capital gains and the exchange of information. Under the agreement both countries are allowed tax dividends flowing between them but limits are imposed on the level of tax that the country of source may impose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Czech Republic will reduce its dividend withholding tax rate to five per cent where dividends are paid to an Australian resident company which directly holds at least 20 per cent of the capital of the Czech Republic company paying dividends. In all other cases the normal Czech Republic dividend withholding rate of 25 per cent will be reduced to 15 per cent. Australia will impose a maximum dividend withholding tax rate of five per cent where Australian companies pay franked dividends to Czech residents provided the Australian domestic withholding tax on franked dividends is five per cent or less. Australia will also reduce its normal rate of withholding tax on franked dividends paid by Australian residents to Czech residents from 30 per cent to 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practical effect would seem to be that the terms are that Australia's domestic non-resident dividend withholding tax exemption for franked dividends will continue to apply to dividends paid by Australian resident companies to Czech Republic residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you turn to the agreement itself, article 10 deals with dividends. In the first part of article 10, it is stated that dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a contracting state for the purposes of its tax, being dividends to which a resident of the other contracting state is beneficially entitled, may be taxed in that other state. Part 2 of article 10 then goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, those dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident for the purposes of its tax, and according to the laws of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) 5 per cent of the gross amount of so much of the dividends as has been franked (with imputed company tax payments) in accordance with the laws of Australia relating to tax, where under those laws the rate of tax on franked dividends paid to a non-resident by a company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of its tax does not exceed 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends;</PARA>
<PARA>The question I have for the government and the Assistant Treasurer or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) in relation to that particular article is that it would appear to leave open the possibility of tax being imposed on franked dividends in circumstances where that tax is not imposed at the present time. I understand that a reading of article 10 indicates that it does not actually impose that tax, but it does seem to me that that possibility of tax being imposed in circumstances where it is not at the present time is certainly open on any reasonable interpretation of what that means. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether that means that there is some contemplation on the part of the government to change the tax treatment of franked dividends in relation to not only double tax agreements such as this but more generally franked dividends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major parts of the agreement, as I said, related to interest and royalties, capital gains and exchange of information, which I do not propose to address in any great detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter which I wish to raise in relation to this bill is that in July the government indicated that other double tax agreements might be finalised prior to the introduction of the bill, including double tax agreements with the Slovak Republic, Romania, Russia and Malaysia. So far as I am aware, there has not been any public announcement concerning the signing of any of these agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June a joint statement was issued by the Australia-Russia Joint Commission for Trade and Economic Cooperation stating that a double tax agreement between Australia and Russia was `almost ready for signature'. There has been no announcement regarding the signing of this particular agreement and I again take this opportunity of asking the government if the proposed agreements with those nations, notably the Slovak Republic, Romania, Russia and Malaysia, are in fact close to completion and when we might expect that such agreements will be made with those nations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill is entirely sensible and valuable. The system of double tax agreements is now well established and it is important to extend it to any country with which we have substantial economic relations, and therefore I completely support the bill. But I want to use this opportunity to talk about a broader issue within the general area of international taxation, and that is to do with the consequences of the effect of globalisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the dominant feature of the world at present is increasing integration of many aspects of the global economy. That is particularly clear in relation to financial markets but it is also true of the extent of growth of trade. Trade is growing at roughly double the rate of economic growth on average in countries. There are increased financial flows between countries and the consequence of that kind of integration is that there are other results relating to the environment and to societies which are also a direct result of globalisation. Many people are concerned about the increase in the number of people wanting to migrate. There is growing concern about the international trade in drugs. There are all sorts of aspects in the economic, social and environmental spheres which are demonstrating that the world is a more integrated place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: how does the international community respond to that globalisation? A lot of people would recognise that there have to be international responses to some of those activities. Some of them can be adequately addressed only through cooperative international action. There are all kinds of examples of that, a very obvious one being the need to reduce the threat of war through international peacekeeping. The UN of course is attempting to address the problem of peacekeeping but is really constrained by the lack of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an entirely different area, the retention of biodiversity, there is a growing international concern about the rate at which the natural world is being eroded as a result of population growth and economic growth, yet the retention of biodiversity is being left entirely to individual countries when the benefit would be a global one. That is another area where international cooperative action is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can be argued that a part of the answer to the unemployment problem in many countries depends on a degree of international cooperation. In that area it is mostly national policies that are involved, but to the extent that there is more effective cooperative economic policy aimed at stimulating employment growth it will be possible for many nations to increase employment opportunities faster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly true that in the area of drug trade international cooperative action is essential. In relation to terrorism, cooperative action is necessary. It has been obvious for decades that many aspects of the global infrastructure relating to civil aviation or the postal services&mdash;let alone telecommunications or the use of the radio spectrum&mdash;require international cooperation, and that occurs through the United Nations agencies that work on those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is true that many of those kinds of international cooperative actions are inadequate, and that is partly because of what economists call the `free rider' problem, the problem of everyone waiting for everyone else to take some action which would be in everyone's benefit because they hope that the others will take the issue up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be very nice if other countries paid more for peacekeeping or other countries increased their overseas aid so that there were more funds flowing for disaster relief and development to developing countries. It would be lovely if other countries were more active in trying to suppress the drug trade or to encourage the retention of forests and so on. But every country&mdash;and within a country every individual&mdash;is to some extent affected by this free rider problem, so nations have had to introduce during the last century a compulsory taxation in order to provide collectively those infrastructure services and human services which would otherwise be inadequately provided if they depended on voluntary activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I am obviously trying to move towards is that such activity may well be necessary internationally in an increasingly integrated global community. It may well be that simply depending on voluntary contributions to the UN for peacekeeping, or inadequate subscriptions to the UN, or strictly limited subscriptions to the IMF, the World Bank or IATA or whatever it happens to be, may not provide sufficient funds for everything that needs to be done on a global basis. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be, therefore, that we are getting to the stage where some form of international charging, or even international compulsory taxation, is necessary. People have been saying this for a couple of decades, but I think&mdash;because the pace of globalisation is now much faster and the effect of globalisation is much more widespread&mdash;that the need for global action to reduce dangers, volatilities, instabilities or damaging effects is now becoming much stronger. So the case for international collective action is also much stronger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that kind of reason that Gareth Evans, amongst other international leaders, has been starting to talk about the need for some form of international taxation. There are many forms that could occur. It obviously is best if they are targeted at the problem they are meant to address, because that makes them more readily acceptable, but that may not always be possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particularly good example would be a very small charge on airline travel in order to offset the effects of greenhouse gas emissions that air travel causes. Another kind of tax which has been talked about in Europe is a carbon emission tax to discourage the continuing rapid growth in the level of greenhouse gas emissions in that continent and, with that, acid rain and the damage to forests that that causes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another idea that is receiving some attention at present is the idea of a small levy on foreign exchange transactions. That could, if it were introduced, be appropriately used for improving the functioning of financial markets, for establishing emergency funds for dealing with crises, for increasing the training and sophistication of capital markets in developing countries in ways that would be of benefit to financial markets themselves, and for improving the effectiveness of the flow of capital between the countries where there are large reserves of capital and the countries which need them greatly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are proposals for small charges for the use of the global commons: oceans, space or the electromagnetic spectrum. That is another form of international tax. There are proposals for small charges on international postage or telephone communications as means of funding the organisations that have responsibility for coordinating those activities and ensuring that standards are maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These may sound like visionary ideas, but they are not in fact because we are getting very close to the point where steps along that line are going to be necessary. It is not that these issues are ones that we are going to be able to handle adequately voluntarily much longer. It is an area where charges are going to be essential and where small levies may well also be essential in due course in order to fund necessary cooperative global activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that it is time for us to start to think in such terms. Some things can be adequately provided only when they are provided for everyone, because everyone will have access to them when they are provided, and that means that everyone should make some contribution to the funding of them through a compulsory tax system. The rationale, as I began by saying, is exactly the same as for national taxation and the provision of national public goods such as education, roads and health services. Such things are not going to be provided internationally, but other things are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to be able to control the spread of disease, for example, for particular kinds of diseases, some kinds of international action are going to be necessary. There is a growth in concern about the danger of global epidemics. We have evidence of them in the AIDS epidemic; international action earlier could have contributed more to containment of that epidemic. Other epidemics will occur. That is another area where cooperative international action is going to be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put these ideas on the public agenda in the parliament because I think we are going to have to think about these things much more carefully over the next few years than we have had to do so far. We are inevitably going to have to do so because of the nature of what is happening, particularly in the global economy. We must respond collectively in modest, careful ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is only necessary to do internationally what cannot adequately be done nationally. It is not a question of arguing for world government; I am not in the business of that at all. But I am arguing that some forms of international cooperation are becoming essential and that adequate funding of those on a compulsory basis is going to also be essential. We have to start to think about how that should occur. </PARA>

So I cannot, unfortunately, give him a time on those. All I can say, from Australia's point of view, is that we are putting in all of the effort that we can, but we rely on cooperation. </PARA>

<PARA>The Customs Tariff Bill 1995 introduces the new Customs Tariff Act, to come into effect on 1 July l996. The act will replace the Customs Tariff Act 1987, as announced in the context of the government's 1994 white paper, Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new customs tariff will incorporate some 350 changes to the international convention on the harmonised commodity description and coding system proposed by the World Customs Organisation. Australia became a signatory to the convention in 1987 and in 1993 the World Customs Organisation agreed to these changes. Australia is now giving effect to our obligations to align our tariff structure with the international standard. The bill will also renumber and update the wording of the legal provisions in the current tariff. The bill removes unnecessary tariff splits in schedule 3 and redefines some of the concessional provisions contained in schedule 4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now outline the changes contained in this bill in more detail. The legal provisions of the current act have been amended since 1987 on an ad hoc basis to cater for changes to the treatment accorded goods from certain countries and for other purposes. The new act will consolidate these changes and renumber the provisions. There are also textual changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 1 provides a new listing of countries which benefit under the Australian system of tariff preferences for developing countries. In 1991 and 1993, the government decided to phase out the developing country margin of preference for goods produced or manufactured in all except the least developed countries. The new listings within schedule 1 group these countries according to the tariff treatment which they receive. Overall, the intention of these amendments is to retain the existing provisions of the current act but to present them in a more logical and orderly sequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3 presents the list of customs classification and duty rates applicable to goods. It is in this schedule that the 350 changes recommended by the World Customs Organisation occur. The changes reflect differing patterns in international trade and technological developments. Their aim is to regroup like products in the same subheadings, and to correct anomalies which have become apparent in the harmonised system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has tried to maintain existing duty rates wherever possible. To maintain the existing levels, some additional 200 national splits were created in the tariff. In one case, that relating to snowboard boots, local industry and importers have defined the essential characteristics of the boots for a tariff precedent, and this will allay concerns that other boots, which are now dutiable, could enter duty free. In only five cases have duty rates not been preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rate of duty for graded and ungraded pearls, whether or not strung for the convenience of transport, will be free, in line with current practice. Graded pearls are sold, according to accepted international practice, as `temporarily strung for transport purposes'. As Australia currently has a duty on strung pearls but not on those unstrung, Australian industry practice has been to import the pearls unstrung. This will no longer be required from 1 July 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The duty rate for waste and scrap of batteries will be set at free. While this does not reflect the existing rate for waste of mercury and lithium batteries, it is supported by industry. They have advised that there are no imports of such waste and scrap into Australia, nor are there any plans to do so in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tyre cord fabrics of woven glass fibres and other woven fabrics of glass will be combined in new subheadings. There have been no imports from developing countries over the last five years of these tyre cord fabrics. The duty rate for developing countries will therefore be that applying to other woven fabrics of glass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has not been possible to identify separately the specific goods which transfer between subheadings in two instances: food preparations containing cocoa and input or output units for computers. The World Customs Organisation has altered the basis of the calculation of cocoa content for certain food preparations. As such, it has not been possible to identify separately these specific food preparations which are transferring to an existing subheading. The duty rate proposed reflects the rate of the predominant proportion of trade, some 92 per cent, within the expanded subheading. Input or output units for computers&mdash;for example, keyboards and printers&mdash;from five existing subheadings are combining into one new subheading. The proposed duty rate will reflect the rate applicable to 98 per cent of the total trade in those subheadings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some national splits in tariff subheadings have been proposed that may eventually prove to be unnecessary because there is no trade. These subheadings will be examined when adequate statistics become available. If the situation so requires, proposals will be brought forward to close up the subheadings whose tariff splits are serving no purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the implementation of the Customs Tariff Act 1955, administrative arrangements will be established within the Department of Industry, Science and Technology and the Australian Customs Service whereby aggrieved parties, including our trading partners, may raise concerns if anomalous situations arise in the context of the government's decision to preserve the duty arrangements. The appeal period will extend from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I now draw your attention to amendments to schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Bill. Schedule 4 contains the list of concessional provisions. The three key changes proposed relate to items 17, 18 and 20, which are all reimport provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Item 17 allows for goods that have been exported from Australia, other than for repair and renovation, to re-enter Australia without being penalised by having to pay duty a second time if their identity has not been altered. It was intended that under this item goods are returned in an unaltered condition and have not been subject to treatment, industrial processing, repair, renovation, alteration or any other process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become apparent, however, that the current wording of the item allows its use for wider purposes. For instance, some goods are re-entering Australia after undergoing industrial processing in another country. The amendments are intended to ensure that item 17 cannot be used where any industrial processing has been undertaken overseas before reimportation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Item 18 permits goods or parts of goods to re-enter Australia duty free in accordance with the provisions of a specific warranty. The changes in item 18C will extend these provisions to goods subject to a global recall for safety or related reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Item 20 permits the re-entry of goods sent overseas for repair and renovation but requires that duty be paid on the value of the repair or renovation. These provisions will be retained as the new item 20A.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Item 20B contains a new concessional provision. International best practice for repair and renovation dictates that for many purposes batch repair will be undertaken. This means that the faulty product is swapped with an identical unit already repaired. The good sent for repair is then stored until sufficient numbers of the same product have accumulated for economical repair. Under the present operation of item 20, companies are being charged duty on the full value of the items exchanged under such arrangements rather than on the value of the repairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs to recognise the move internationally to batch repair processing. The new item 20B, with related by-law, will allow companies to enter into agreements with Customs to introduce batch repair arrangements without penalty. The by-law arrangements will be similar to those applying to the tariff export concessions&mdash;or Texco scheme&mdash;on goods which the company will send overseas for batch repair prior to reimportation. The new item 20B by-law will permit companies to take advantage of batch repair process arrangements whilst allowing Customs to ensure compliance concerns are met. Once a company has such an agreement and is registered, it will be able to use the by-law. Companies will need to retain documentation demonstrating that they are meeting the provisions of the by-law. Customs will employ risk management techniques to ensure that the government's policy intent is being met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as proposals to modify items 17, 18 and 20 a number of administrative changes to a range of other schedule 4 items are proposed. These changes are minor and will improve the administration of the schedule. The proposed changes include the rationalisation of numbering to fill unused items and the splitting of items where appropriate. Some of the previous items had coverage of two or more types of goods and it has been difficult to issue specific by-laws for these goods. These have been split into separate items to facilitate their administration. A summary of amendments contained in this bill has been prepared and circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Customs Tariff Bill 1995, as has been described in the second reading speech, is to redraft and consolidate the Customs Tariff Act 1987, repeal the Customs Tariff Act 1987 due to this particular consolidation and restructuring of the act, and incorporate the harmonised commodity description and coding system classification modifications that have been agreed by signatory countries. The coalition does not oppose this bill and, in fact, supports the arrangements that have been put in hand. Concerning the financial impact, the bill enacts a number of technical changes implementing a new system of administration and does not incur any expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few brief comments in regard to the harmonised commodity and coding system which was developed in 1988 as a classification system for administering imports and exports and for collecting foreign trade data. This system was established by the Customs Cooperation Council, which is an international body of which Australia is a member. The system was created for three reasons: firstly, so that there is a universal classification and code system for internationally traded goods; secondly, so that customs classifications are in step with both modern technology and recent products that have come onto the international market; and, thirdly, so that the collection and quantification of foreign trades statistics is simplified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The harmonised system is now known as the harmonised commodity description and coding system, HCDCS, and is the international tariff system sponsored by the World Customs Organisation in Brussels. The new system will upgrade the old one providing universal six-digit coding, removing old domestic subheadings and the archaic tailored Australian tariff. The first six figures of each classification are taken from the international system and the seventh and eighth figures are inserted by Australia. These seventh and eighth figures provide a separate category whilst under the same tariff grouping whereby Australia can impose its own domestically determined tariff rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Customs Organisation introduced 350 classification changes to the HCDCS as agreed by the signatory nations. These classification changes were in response to new products coming into the international trade market. Value added, technically advanced products and components emerged without a suitable separate tariff classification to cater for them, which led to the introduction of these new classifications. Australia is adopting these international changes as agreed and to maintain its own tariff program has added an extra 200 national tariff splits. These national tariff splits cover those goods whose tariff classification is subject to the nature of their use or, alternatively, the product of which they form a subsidiary component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With both the 350 classification changes determined by the WCO and 200 different classifications by Australia, this bill introduces 550 changes to the tariff classification index act. In fact, it is one of the main functions of the bill. Nevertheless, the changes all referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) are also of significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition welcomes the review. It indicates that it should be a simpler process and a more understandable process for those obliged to administer the Customs Act and we believe, in that regard, it is positive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be speaking on the Customs Tariff Bill 1995. It has a primary purpose of incorporating classification changes agreed to by signatory countries to the harmonised commodity description and coding system. In 1988 Australia adopted a new classification system for administering imports and exports and for the collection and presentation of foreign trade statistics. This new system, the harmonised commodity description and coding system, was developed over a number of years by an international body, the Customs Cooperation Council, of which Australia is a member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The harmonised system was developed for three purposes: first, to upgrade customs classifications to reflect technological developments and changes in goods traded internationally; second, to provide international uniformity in classifying the coded goods; and, third, to simplify the collection, analysis and comparison of foreign trade statistics. The system is now known as the harmonised commodity description and coding system and is the international tariff system sponsored by the World Customs Organisation based in Brussels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following deliberations of the international body, 350 classification changes were agreed by signatory countries to the system. Australia is adopting the international changes as agreed and, to retain existing tariff levels, has provided 200 or so national tariff splits additional to those recommended by the World Customs Organisation. The overall outcome, as contained in amendments proposed in this bill, means about 550 changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is quite comprehensive as a piece of legislation altering the classification methods for Australia's customs tariff regime. It provides an opportunity to talk in a general sense about that regime. Over the past 10 years I have been a very strong supporter of the government's tariff reduction program. I think it is fair to say that the program was made inevitable by the globalisation of capital, increases in volumes and the pace of capital movements throughout the world economy. This process started in the early 1970s with the collapse of the Bretton Woods agreement for fixed foreign exchange rates and thereafter followed the liberalisation of the foreign exchange market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia experienced a delay in this. We did not liberalise our foreign exchange markets in the late 1970s. We had J.W. Howard as Treasurer at that time. We had to wait for the Labor government's election in 1983 to float the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This liberalisation process has been followed by major reforms opening up the financial investment and capital equity flows into and out of Australia. Those who argue that these things can be reversed, and that this legislation should be reversed, fail to comprehend the scale of capital movements throughout the international economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am indebted to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine of 7 October this year which provides a guide to the extraordinary growth in capital movements throughout the world. It is very useful for the parliament, which talks so much about globalisation and about the internationalisation of the Australian economy, to get a feeling for the sorts of aggregate capital movements we are talking about. In 1973 typical daily foreign exchange trading amounted to only $10 billion to $20 billion. In 1983 it was still modest, at around $60 billion worldwide, but by 1992, the most recent year for which figures are available from the Bank for International Settlements, about $900 billion a day was moving around the foreign exchange markets of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ratio of foreign exchange transactions to world trade jumped from 10:1 in 1983 to more than 60:1 in 1992. The results of the BIS survey from April 1995 are yet to be published, but figures from national central banks suggest that daily turnover is now an extraordinary $1.3 trillion&mdash;an extraordinary amount. The total foreign currency reserves of governments in the rich industrial economies amount to only $640 billion. The stock of international bank lending, net of redepositing, surged to $4.2 trillion last year from a base of $265 billion in 1975. The outstanding volume of international bonds jumped to more than $2 trillion last year from a base of $259 billion in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures are incredibly impressive. I was interested also to note a report earlier this year by the McKinsey Global Institute which said that we are only halfway through the process. McKinsey have estimated that the total stock of financial assets traded in the global capital market increased from $5 trillion in 1980 to $35 trillion in 1992, equivalent to twice the GDP of OECD countries. The firm forecasts&mdash;this is the significant figure to appreciate&mdash;that the market will swell to $83 trillion in the year 2000. That is three times the OECD economies' national output, three times the advanced economies' GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures really do reinforce the inevitability of globalisation and the need to liberalise trade, capital and investment markets. They reinforce the need for legislation such as this, which is very responsive in its tariff classification system to changes in technology, to changes in trade and in the pace and volume of international capital movements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are also some important figures to relate to the parliament regarding capital movements for Australia. These figures also bring home the significance of globalisation and how it is impacting on our small, open trading nation. From the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reserve Bank Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of June 1995 we see the daily average of total foreign exchange turnover against all currencies for March of this year was $56 billion. That is up from $38 billion in 1991-92. The daily average of total foreign exchange turnover against Australian dollars in March of this year was $24 billion. That is an increase from $15 billion in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Australian currency is the third or fourth most traded currency in the world. But the figures are also quite astounding for Australia's foreign liabilities and assets&mdash;of course, indicating the flow in and out of Australia of foreign capital. Gross foreign investment in Australia in the March quarter of this year was $376 billion. Gross Australian investment abroad was $132 billion. We can balance those figures out, I suppose, by an understanding that our gross domestic product is around $500 billion and that our foreign exchange reserves for the end of the financial year 1994-95 equalled $15.1 billion. So the scale is quite comprehensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises the question: how should governments respond? Governments should respond in a fashion such as is indicated in this legislation&mdash;that is, international cooperation&mdash;to make sure that the liberalisation and globalisation processes are undertaken as much as possible within the public interest. The internationalisation of capital forces the internationalisation of government controls and government policy. It is the only way in which national institutions can properly serve their countervailing role; that is, to protect the public interest and to, as best they can, advance the interests of their national economy and national population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just returned from this parliament's delegation to the European Parliament where, of course, the European Union provides the best possible example of this process&mdash;how they have moved towards free trade in goods, services, people, capital and ideas, and how they are moving quite comprehensively to a monetary union through the Maastricht Treaty and all that flows from that. A monetary union, with a single currency of course, inevitably results in unity and cooperation in the areas of taxation policy and social policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note for the benefit of the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) that even Albania&mdash;his model of economic development&mdash;has now awoken to the benefits of global trade and investment. They are applying for membership of the Council of Europe. They may well be one of those eastern European countries that apply for membership of the European Parliament and the European Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, of course, raises the question in the context of customs, tariffs and Australia's trade position: what are we to do in our part of the world? Of course, this government is taking the initiative through APEC, recognising the importance of free trade and free investment movements as consummated in the Bogor declaration, that is, to have free trade and investment in place in the Asia-Pacific by the year 2010 for developed nations and 2020 for non-developed nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a debate like this it is very important&mdash;I am sure National Party members will recognise this&mdash;to appreciate that there are still major problems, particularly with regard to Australia's access to agricultural markets in Asia, Europe and the United States. It is distressing indeed to read reports of arguments presented by the Japanese government about excluding agriculture from the APEC arrangements. It is distressing indeed to learn of talk in the United States about expanding their agricultural subsidies into Asian markets and thereby restrict the penetration and trade access that Australian producers would enjoy in those markets. These are sobering things which reinforce the point. When we are talking about customs tariffs, when we are talking about trade liberalisation, the need to remain vigilant is all important and forever present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even looking at the success of the Uruguay Round of GATT, which produced a 40 per cent reduction in tariffs, it still left a situation in world trade where 56 per cent of trade remains tariff protected. We cannot rest on our laurels post-Uruguay. We need to keep the ball rolling, we need to keep the wheel turning, towards trade liberalisation, appreciating the fact that 56 per cent of world trade, even after the implementation of the Uruguay Round, will remain tariff protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia, there are few more important issues for our national growth prospects than to secure free trade access for our agricultural products. In Europe there are some reforms to the common agricultural policy under way. Those reforms are twofold. The first is to bundle all the non-tariff measures into bound tariffs&mdash;that is, bound tariffs that cannot increase. Whether they are non-tariff or tariff protectionist measures, it is still protection. So much more work needs to be done in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reform to the common agricultural policy of the EU is to transfer output based subsidies on agriculture to income based subsidies&mdash;that is, to remove the incentive for ever growing output and production in the agricultural sector knowing it will be constantly subsidised. Whether the subsidies are on income or output, they are still subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson) would appreciate the fact that in Australia we do not have those luxuries. We do not have relatively large income or output subsidies on our agricultural produce. If we are going to talk about a level playing field and free trade access, much more work needs to be done with the European Union, as it does through APEC, as it does through the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are difficult issues, but I think there are some signs that public opinion is changing. In the past agricultural reform has been resisted because of the electoral force of the rural lobby. It happened here in Australia, I suppose, through the 196Os under McEwen, but it is still there in Europe in the 1990s. European public opinion is changing. Why should the internationally competitive manufacturing and services sector in Europe not receive protection or subsidies, yet the agricultural sector does? There is a massive inconsistency to which public opinion in Europe is awakening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also the inefficiency of European agriculture, which is so protected, adds to the basic cost to consumers in Europe. That is not to the public good. All these protectionist measures shelter away untenable, completely inefficient agriculture. Look at France, for instance, where the problem is not so much technology or management; it is the small size of the farm holdings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very strong need to rationalise the size of farms. We have seen in Australia over the years the increasing size of farm holdings to give economies of scale that are all important to success on world markets. Why should the French and the Europeans be subsidising and protecting their agriculture when the benefits of reform have been shown right here in Australia? The rationalisation makes the industry more efficient. You will never make the industry more efficient by allowing agriculture to rely on subsidies and protection in the European market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The inconsistencies are there. The European Union talks about micro reform. It talks about competition policy in all sectors bar agriculture. Australia constantly needs to be asking the question in legislation like this, with initiatives like those of APEC and in our relations with the EU: why exempt agriculture? Why should that be different in the world trade environment? Why should Australia be locked out of those important markets?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second inconsistency&mdash;and I am sure the opposition will relate to this&mdash;is between business welfare on the one hand and social welfare on the other. Business welfare&mdash;subsidies for agriculture, subsidies for any other industry sector&mdash;is said to be okay but social welfare is deemed to be unacceptable. One only needs to comprehend the sorts of draconian reforms that have been undertaken by the United States Congress, spearheaded by the Republican majority, to cut down on the welfare sector, to literally deprive people of the safety net role of government. One only needs to look at some of the reforms now being passed by the Danish parliament or look at Britain at the Thatcherite revolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only needs to go back to the comments two days ago by the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) to understand that there is a massive inconsistency. You cannot argue on the one hand that business welfare is in the public interest, and on the other hand argue that social welfare needs to be totally cut away. These sorts of arguments are taking hold in Europe, as I think they have been expressed here in Australia. There are some signs of hope on these issues&mdash;signs of hope expressed in European public opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the very strong argument that, because of the ever changing nature of the world economy, today's protection wall can be tomorrow's act of folly. With liberalisation in a dynamic economy and with vast and increasing movements in capital it is in every nation's interest to try to open up markets, particularly in those sectors where they are increasing their competitiveness. I would have thought that this compelling argument will be so impressive in international forums for years to come that I am quietly optimistic that world trade liberalisation will continue to move in the right direction. As I mentioned earlier, there is the need to be forever vigilant and present these arguments and understand the benefits of free trade arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note with regard to my own vigilance that there are some backsliders on these questions of tariffs in the parliament. There is an interesting unity ticket between the extreme Left and the extreme Right in the corner of the House between the member for Wills and the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). There is an unusual alliance between a Labor defector&mdash;a sort of disenchanted type from the western suburbs of Melbourne&mdash;and the National Party member for Kennedy. I cannot understand the argument&mdash;and I do not think it holds up&mdash;that there should be this sort of unity ticket between the extreme Left and the extreme Right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a left-wing perspective, quite truthfully, what do tariff and protectionist measures protect? They do not protect jobs. The job losses were highest in Australia in the 1970s in highly protected industries. Tariff protection protects capital and profits, not jobs. From the perspective of the extreme Right, particularly a National Party member, how can he support tariff measures that add to the costs in manufacturing and services that are met by all farmers in Australia? These things are exceptionally difficult. The arguments of members such as the members for Wills and Kennedy are totally inconsistent and totally false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the substance of the debate on protection and tariffs, my own view is that we should not be arguing a pro- or anti-interventionist debate. I think that government intervention on industry policy makes a lot of sense, as long as it is restricted to the short term. Short-term measures and short-term government intervention on industry policy make a lot of sense. It can do a lot of good in clearing away market blockages in capital and equity markets, clearing away market blockages for information and export market penetration and access in training and research and development. That has very much been the direction of this government's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Long-term intervention has a range of disadvantages. It builds up reliance and a culture of dependence. I had a beautiful example of this on a visit to New Zealand earlier this year when I visited Mace Engineering&mdash;a metal and engineering company in Christchurch. The proprietor there said, `When New Zealand was tariff protected, we had guaranteed profits. We had no competitors. We were a large firm in the domestic market. It was a licence to print money.' When the tariff walls and the reforms came into place, of course, the need to compete and the need to upgrade and build a culture of cooperation and innovation became very important. Now the company is right at the leading edge of output and innovation. It is in the business of forming an alliance with an inventor in New Zealand to construct a plastic engine for motorbikes. This is the sort of impact you get once industry no longer relies on protectionist measures such as tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem with long-term intervention is that it is a very blunt instrument. I have addressed that in the House on previous occasions. The third problem is that it is very hard to plan ahead and very hard for governments to have five-year industry plans when the economy is so dynamic and changing so rapidly. That is my summary, ranging far and wide in geography and subject matter, but overall I support the legislation before us. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would like to thank the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) for his usual excellent contribution to debates of this House, and the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) for the support of the opposition for the Customs Tariff Bill. As I indicated in my second reading speech, the main purpose of the bill is to incorporate some 350 changes to the harmonised commodity description and coding system, which has been recommended by the World Customs Organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intent of the new legal provisions is the same as before, but the bill now sets this out in a more logical and systematic format. As I said earlier in my second reading speech, some of the provisions contained in schedule 4 have been redrafted&mdash;sometimes to tighten the provisions but mainly to make the administration of the concessions more efficient. Importantly, as I said earlier, the bill updates and renumbers the legal provisions of the Customs Tariff Act. In essence, it is a consolidated act. This will make the act far more easier to deal with than hitherto. The current act was enacted in 1987. Since that time quota restrictions have been phased out and the conditions pertaining to how Australia applies the margin of preference under the Australian system of tariff preferences have been changed dramatically. That is another reason for this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter that was not raised in the debate was the effect on rates of duty. I believe it is necessary to place on the record the fact that the government instructed the Australian Customs Service that the rates of duty already legislated for 1 July 1996 were to be maintained. This has been achieved in all instances except for five commodities. Where goods have moved from one tariff heading to another, the rates have been maintained through the creation of about 250 national tariff splits. As I said, I have already listed in my second reading speech those commodities for which the rates of duty will change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Customs Service will administer an appeals mechanism for 12 months after the implementation of this bill through which allegedly aggrieved parties may appeal situations where they believe they have been adversely affected by changes contained in this bill. This is a measure of equity, so to speak, to enable anomalies in the legislation to be identified and, if necessary, corrected. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of requesting the introduction of amendments is to amend the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989. In line with the five-year time frame of the exotic animal disease preparedness program, a number of sections of the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989 cease to have effect from 30 June 1995. The amendments to this act are to rectify the unintended consequence of the cessation on 30 June 1995 of the sections of the act dealing with levy collection and payments into the trust account.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exotic animal disease preparedness program has been funded by the Commonwealth and the livestock industries on an equal basis, with industry providing funds via an exotic disease levy. As not all levies from industry were due for collection and payment into the trust account before the provisions of the act ceased, there is need to restore the authority to enable this to occur. These amendments will ensure that any exotic animal disease levy received by the Commonwealth is paid into the exotic animal disease preparedness trust account and that the industry funds are invested until the closure of the account. The amendments will also clarify the procedures for closing the account and the industry research bodies to receive the residual industry funds at the cessation of the program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) has been before this House before. It is back here this time because the government has chosen to make a series of amendments, which I have to say were very hastily put together, allowing little time at all for consultation and for the coalition to consider the changes proposed. I am concerned that this happens quite often, and in this case it has made life quite difficult. Whilst under duress and under some degree of pressure concessions were made, and we were given the time to take this back for consideration by our joint parties, the fact is that it ought not to have been necessary to pursue that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original clauses of this omnibus bill seek to do three things: firstly, to change the way export inspection charges are imposed on certain fish exports to accord with industry wishes to ensure equity; secondly, to remove the need to register wool tax payments on sales of small amounts of wool; and, thirdly, to provide a rollover of tax collected for research and development in one year to later years. We considered all that quite a long time ago and determined to support it all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the further amendments proposed by the government, which were considered at very short notice, will also be supported. They allow the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation&mdash;AWRAP as it has become known&mdash;to continue its role in chemical residue monitoring and education. They give the minister the power to set charges to recover the cost of monitoring compliance with the conditions attached to woodchip export licences issued by the Commonwealth. There is a series of administrative amendments which will rectify the unintended consequences of the cessation of sections of the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989 on 30 June this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also three amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, and these will be dealt with in detail for the opposition by my colleague the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). These further amendments will, firstly, ensure that persons conducting offshore petroleum operations under the act respect, and not unduly interfere with, native title rights and interests when conducting these operations; secondly, strengthen the minister's ability to make safety regulations under the act; and, thirdly, give legal force to the system of awarding offshore petroleum exploration permits to ensure that it is fully effective and adequately protects the rights of explorers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to those which fall within my portfolio area. The amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 will provide for the continuation of AWRAP's chemical residue monitoring and education programs which were to cease at the end of this year. I had a bit to say about wool this morning. I am not going to recap it, but I will say that the activities referred to in this act will now be specified functions of AWRAP, although AWRAP will not have regulatory powers in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 these activities were to be divested to industry before the end of 1995. However, the wool industry has not been able to identify a more effective and efficient means of undertaking residue monitoring and education programs than currently exists through AWRAP. The wool industry supports the amendments. I record my appreciation that the minister has been prepared to listen to commonsense and act on this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government announced in December last year at the time it issued the 1995 hardwood woodchip export licences&mdash;we all remember that time; it was a very controversial time and one which saw a very unhealthy fracas which I suspect is likely to be repeated, given the mess the government is again making of forestry policy&mdash;that it would recover the cost of monitoring compliance with its licence conditions from industry. This was confirmed in the budget with the announcement that a dedicated and independent monitoring unit would be established within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. The amendments to the Export Control Act 1982 will enable the Minister for Resources to make regulations to cover the cost by way of licence fees. Once the amendment is passed and royal assent granted, the minister will be able to make ministerial orders to recover the cost of monitoring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's intention, as I understand it, to establish fees for monitoring the 1996 hardwood woodchip export licences, which were supposed to have been issued this month. Heaven only knows now when they will be. We have seen an extension of this whole debate in the most extraordinary way in recent months. Whilst the National Association of Forest Industries accepts that the Commonwealth compliance monitoring and cost recovery mechanisms will be implemented, they will join us, I am sure, in seeking a commitment from the minister that charges will be minimised by ensuring that the Commonwealth does not duplicate state monitoring procedures. I know this government often finds it very hard to trust the states, particularly in the delicate area of forestry, but in this area we see no reason for them to duplicate what the states already do. So the coalition wants the DPIE monitoring unit to effectively audit, without going unnecessarily beyond that principle, the state processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendment sought by the government relates to the exotic animal disease preparedness program. It has run now for the past five years. It has been funded by the Commonwealth and the livestock industries on an equal basis, with industry providing funds via an exotic disease levy. The program will terminate at the end of this year and its activities will be taken over by the new Australian Animal Health Council, which has a wider focus. The AAHC will be jointly funded by the Commonwealth, the states and industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of sections of the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989 ceased to have effect on 30 June 1995, with the unintended consequence that levies due but not collected until after this date cannot be paid into the exotic animal disease preparedness trust account. That is, if you like, an unintended consequence&mdash;one of the things, I daresay, which happen from time to time. So the amendments to this act will ensure that any exotic animal disease levy collected by the Commonwealth is paid into the trust account and for the industry funds to be invested until the account is closed, when the remaining sections of the act cease to have effect on 31 December 1995 and funds are distributed to industry bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further amendments correct anomalies in the trust account administration and close the arrangements which are not consistent with the Audit Act 1901. It stipulates that a trust account must have a zero balance before it can be closed. The amendments will allow funds to be distributed to industry prior to the closure date. </PARA>

Leave was sought to deal with government amendments 1 to 17 together. Leave has been refused and, therefore, the procedure, which you are rightly concerned about, is to deal with each amendment singly. The minister has moved amendment No. 1 and I believe he has spoken to it. The question before the chair is that amendment No. 1 be agreed to.</PARA></TALK.START>

So four minimum conditions, which do not include overtime, penalty rates, holiday loadings, for $317 a week.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The WA legislation does not have a no disadvantage test for enterprise agreements that depart from award provisions. This will result in new employees being compelled to agree to inferior workplace agreements as unscrupulous employers seek to reduce labour costs. There is no effective unfair dismissal legislation. The Western Australian legislation does not require an adequate reason for termination of employees or comply on other grounds with accepted international conventions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully for Western Australian employees, the Commonwealth legislation overrides the Western Australian legislation in relation to unfair dismissal. But remember what Mr Kennett said last week: `When the federal coalition come to office and we introduce the federal legislation the employees will have nowhere to go.' Under the Western Australian legislation minimum pay is fixed by the minister without full consultation with worker or employer representatives. Recently, the minister&mdash;this is a state minister&mdash;fixed the adult rate at $317. Not some tribunal, not an industrial relations tribunal, not a broadly representative body; a state minister fixed it at $317.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Western Australian legislation, workplace agreements are not open for inspection and related information must be kept secret.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The WA minister can strip a state union of its rights and dictate which union will take over its coverage simply because the union seeks the protection of the federal award.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In taking these steps, the WA minister does not have to seek the views of the employees, employers or the unions affected. The WA act will have impractical pre-strike balance&mdash;that is, it would take weeks for unions to take legitimate industrial action including the requirement that unions provide a list of members participating in what may be proposed industrial action. So unions have to provide a list. As soon as someone conducts a ballot, union members who intend to take industrial action not only must go on the list but also have to advise their employer that they are going to take industrial action. It is just incredible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The WA act will place severe restrictions on union rights of entry to workplaces, inhibiting award enforcement. Without inspection of records by unions, enforcement of conditions becomes nigh on impossible. There will not be deductions of union fees. That will no longer be a right and the Western Australian act will place restrictions on political donations by unions but not on companies or business associations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the sort of draconian sleight of things&mdash;all about the rights of ordinary Australians to go to work or to not work as the case may be. These rights are being cut across viciously not by some voice of the nation, by some national plebiscite or by some new order, but by a minister of a state government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's industrial relations legislation is primarily based on the conciliation and arbitration power of the Commonwealth constitution. To protect workers who do not have a guarantee of an award as a genuine safety net&mdash;that is, to guarantee protection right across the work force&mdash;the government has also used the external affairs powers of the constitution. We did so under the Industrial Relations Reform Act to provide protection for workers in the areas of minimum wages, equal pay, unfair dismissal and maternity leave. By contrast, the coalition is very keen to use the corporations power to impose its own industrial relations agenda on workers in all states of this country. The opposition's policy, Jobsback, says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will, if necessary, use whatever constitutional power is available to it, excluding the external affairs power, to ensure that the benefits of this policy are as widely available as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very important to understand that they want to extend these powers and extend the benefits of their policy `as widely available as possible'. We know that Jobsback is still its policy because on 30 January this year&mdash;a very significant day; the day that the Leader of the Opposition took up his duties&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition is on the record as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think jobsback is basically right . . . I saw and see it as a very sound policy.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us not have any doubt that Jobsback is still well and truly locked in there. Nothing has been said by either the Leader of the Opposition or the member for Flinders since then that has in any way altered that position. Nothing they have said has changed their position on the use of the corporations power as well. In respect of that, the Leader of the Opposition has been quite unusually candid. He went to the National Press Club on 7 October 1992 and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our advice is that the corporations power would enable you to legislate in relation to minimum conditions of employment. You are looking at about 70 to 80 per cent of the entire work force.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the estimate they give of what they can cover with their policies. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That's without the benefit of having a like-minded government at the state level.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is not just in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania; this is Australia-wide. This, by his own reckoning, is 70 to 80 per cent of all workers in Australia. Until now, conventional wisdom has always had it that the federal coalition's IR policies would be most felt in those conservative states which have the sort of system that John Howard says he admires, the sort of system he said only in August of this year in the case of Western Australia was his very model. That was two months and two days after Kierath tabled his second wave. That is what you said: it was your model.</PARA>

Look at what happens in the case of Gai, who is employed as a cook grade 2 in a Brisbane hotel. Under her comprehensive award, the hotel resorts and hospitality award, she is entitled at the moment to $401.50 per week. That is her basic entitlement. Then she is entitled to penalty rates which increase her wage by another $106.55. On top of that she receives overtime of $73.96 for the average week. On top of that she receives under her award a tool allowance guaranteed at $4 per week. In other words, the average gross weekly wage is $586.

She stands to lose $184.51 per week&mdash;more than 45 per cent of her average weekly salary. But of course that is not all. Her annual leave loading of $281.05 is no longer guaranteed. So she does that cold as well. The best she could hope for under the coalition would be 10 days non-cumulative sick leave each year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The first year of the implementation of Working Nation has promoted some very successful initiatives. In the first year we have seen 370,000 jobs created and the long-term unemployed numbers fall by 20 per cent, more than double the numbers for unemployment generally. Now the probability of exit from long-term unemployment is the highest it has ever been for a decade. That is the first year of Working Nation. But, as we all know, this government&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;made a commitment in the Working Nation program not for one year of activity but for four years of activity, and we are only one year into that four years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why this program has been successful to date is that we have been able to allocate substantial resources, the most resources ever committed by a government to getting unemployment down&mdash;some $2.2 billion of resources this year. In addition to the resources, we have effectively established a network for the implementation of these resources, a network that is the combination at regional level of area consultative committees&mdash;62 of them around the country&mdash;working in partnership with the CES, the government's delivery network on the ground, to actually apply the programs the way regions want them applied. That is why we are getting such enormous response from the regions. I know members in this House from both sides have talked with great pleasure about the initiatives that the area consultative committee network has been introducing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This structure is not just there for the purpose of implementing the programs. We have also said to the committee, `Give us input into how the programs can be changed. If they can be made to work better, we want to hear about it. We want to make these programs responsive to the needs of regions, responsive to the needs of enterprise and responsive to the needs of individuals.' The package of initiatives that I announced today reflects that consultation. It reflects the fact that these are groups that not only have seen the benefit and opportunity in the first year but also have risen to the challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To summarise these initiatives, what we have done has been to simplify the subsidy arrangements&mdash;reduce the number of programs available from 77 to 10. In the main, this number has been reduced because we have cut out subsidies that used to apply lower amounts for people under the age of 21. This will be a major boost for youth unemployment because now, effectively, full wage subsidies can be obtained for young people seeking work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also extended the subsidy regime to ensure that people in the six- to 12-month category can now get access to jobstart. Because we have made the impressive inroads into long-term unemployment in the first year, which was the objective that we set ourselves, we are now able to address the flow. Despite the fact that we have extended the subsidies to the shorter term unemployed, there is no diminution in commitment or resources available to the long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important initiative is that we have recognised the fact that certain unemployed people face multiple barriers to entry. It is not just the fact that they need training or have lack of recent experience in the labour force. They face a number of reasons why they cannot get back into work. We have now enabled much more flexibility in the way the resources available for them can be applied beyond just the labour market programs. We have also added more places to contracted case managers, the competition to case management by the CES.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are initiatives that have been welcomed by welfare groups and business groups today. They have been welcomed by them because they have been listened to. They have been listened to because the government is saying, `We are prepared to respond; we are prepared to be adaptive in relation to these programs in response to your identified needs.' The reality is that if we have made this progress in one year think what we can do in the remaining three years. It is these initiatives that will enable us to knock that huge hole in the unemployment problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make this final point: this has only been possible because of a government prepared to commit resources to Working Nation. It is only those on this side of the House who are prepared to guarantee those resources. Those on the other side of the House would slash this program if they were to get to office. What we have been able to say to regions and individuals would go out the door.</PARA>

If that is the best you can rely on, let me quote this back to you: we have had employment growth in the first year of Working Nation of 4.7 per cent&mdash;370,000 jobs. That figure must be seen against the background of the statement by the Leader of the Opposition, who said that to argue for 500,000 jobs at the last election was an insult to the intelligence of the Australian population and could never be achieved. He had given up before he ever got to office. But we have produced 655,000 jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same Leader of the Opposition who has given up on the target for getting unemployment down. The other day he was asked about setting a target. He said he would not do it and he did not believe we could get down to five per cent. We believe we can, and we will&mdash;and we will do it under these programs.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the jobs growth&mdash;4.7 per cent, or 370,000 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is now down to 8.5 per cent from a peak of 11.2 per cent. Long-term unemployment is down 20.1 per cent in a year and is now at its lowest level in trend terms since October 1991. In relation to case management, we have seen 477,000 unemployed people go into case management since July 1994, and nearly half of these have achieved outcomes. Competitive case management is in place, with over 250 private community organisations now helping 53,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to training, trainee commencements have increased rapidly, with 6,345 traineeship vacancies lodged with the CES in the September quarter&mdash;almost 200 per cent higher than the September quarter a year previously. More young people today are participating in entry level training than in any of the previous three decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apprentice and trainee commencements, as a proportion of the 15- to 19-year-old age group, are now at record levels similar to those reached in the late 1980s. The 62 regionally based area consultative committees are all up and running, all developing their job drives. Some failure! This is the level of achievement of Working Nation in one year of operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the shadow spokesman for employment is asked about what he would do to generate employment in this country, his stock answer is, `We'd get off the back of small businesses.' That is great comfort to the unemployed out there. If he is really interested in knowing what small business has taken up, let me just tell him some very interesting information I learned today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We set up a traineeship scheme for small business. Before Working Nation, traineeships never existed for the small business industry in this country. In New South Wales and in Victoria we set a target of 1,000 trainees in both of those states by the end of this year. Today that target has been reached and exceeded in both Victoria and New South Wales&mdash;three months ahead of schedule. So small business is recognising the relevance of Working Nation. Small business is picking up the trainees. So we do recognise that small business is going to be the engine for growth in this economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I say that I would not mind if a constructive suggestion came from the other side, because the programs are flexible enough to pick it up. We get this carping, this pretence at concern, this mock anger in terms of you expressing some concern for the unemployed and training, but you wanted to introduce university fees and vouchers when you were spokesman for education on the last occasion, and that is the reason you got dumped from that shadow portfolio when you got back. That is your approach: you would make people pay for it. Then you are an advocate for re-introducing Austrain, which is a discounted wage rate&mdash;discounted by 10 per cent if you have been out of work six months, 20 per cent if you have been out 12 months and 25 per cent if you have been out 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your solution to unemployment is to cut youth wages. They will not have a bar of it, and nor should they. Do not ever say that you do not believe that this program has been succeeding. It has, and we will ensure it continues to succeed. We will meet an objective. We are committed to getting unemployment down to the five per cent target. You on that side of the House have given up on it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House to what extent non-traditional providers of housing loans are entering the market? Can he also indicate what benefits these developments are having for home buyers?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2537" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that there is certainly a significant development in terms of new players coming into the home mortgage area. Traditionally we have seen banks and building societies as being the key lenders for housing. But what we are increasingly seeing is an array of new players coming into that area&mdash;credit unions are certainly exercising much more muscle in that area than they have before, but there are especially mortgage originators. These mortgage originators obtain their funds from a variety of wholesale funding sources including banks, insurance companies and other organisations. These funds are secured against the mortgages issued, sometimes via the issue of mortgage-back securities. The originator acts as an intermediary. The ultimate lender takes the risk that the mortgage will be repaid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This system of mortgage origination is something which is relatively new in our scene, but it is becoming quite significant. In the last year and a half the share of new home mortgages being taken up by these new players has gone from 2.1 per cent to 7.8 per cent. So it is increasing rapidly as a source of home finance for Australian home buyers. There is enormous scope for that. In the United States something like two-thirds of the home loan market is satisfied from this area of mortgage origination rather than from what we would see as the traditional home lending area. So there is enormous scope for these mortgage originators to become much bigger players in the area of home lending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of that is that their interest rates are significantly less than those charged by the banks. The general bank rate at the moment for a variable home loan is 10.5 per cent, but the rates of the mortgage originators are down to as low as 8.7 per cent&mdash;about 1 3/4 per cent or 1.8 per cent less than that general bank rate. Generally they are in the order of one per cent or so less than the average bank rate. The number of these mortgage originators is about 20 at the present time and the number is increasing continually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the AMP society, certainly one of the most powerful financial institutions in the country, announced that it is going to establish a new financial services company called Priority One, which will be involved in home lending with a variable interest rate of 9.4 per cent&mdash;1.1 per cent less than that general bank rate. We are seeing superannuation funds being used in this way, particularly through the industry funds and some other particular funds combining with National Mutual in the superannuation members home loans scheme which began a year ago. That scheme has since then lent some 3,100 home loans involving over $300 million, and its home loan rate is 8.7 per cent. So we are seeing superannuation funds using their funds for investment in housing, along with all the other avenues for investment, and making those funds available to superannuation fund members at rates which are very much below those being charged by the banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefit of these lower interest rates is very substantial. On a $100,000 mortgage over 25 years, a one per cent saving means the reduction of about $70 a month or $21,000 over the life of the loan. So it is a very significant difference that is being built into the system through the development of these alternative home loan providers. Of course, that is having its impact on the banking system. Although the general level of rates has not moved appreciably, we did see that, when official rates were increased by some 2 3/4 per cent last year, the banks did not move their variable mortgage rates by 2 3/4 per cent&mdash;they absorbed one per cent of that and it went up by 1 3/4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also seeing it having an effect in terms of refinancing. The banks are admitting now that, when people come to them and say that they are looking at home loan alternatives in relation to mortgage providers at lower rates, they are prepared to do some refinancing. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> of 9 October a senior bank executive said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When our existing borrowers let us know of their intention to switch to a mortgage originator, we might better the rate being offered. Just the mention of Aussie Home Loans can bring our rates down.</PARA>
<PARA>So these alternatives are opening up to home buyers in Australia in terms of new lenders, new home buyers and those with existing home loans. In terms of new home buyers, the banks are increasingly utilising honeymoon rates to try to provide a more attractive product up front with very low rates in the first year or two to attract the business away from these mortgage originators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have then is a much more competitive system than has historically been the case, one which is increasingly providing alternative lower cost options for home buyers, and that is providing increasingly substantial benefits to home buyers in this country. Compare all that with the system which prevailed before this government came into office, when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, and we got a highly regulated system with the cabinet setting the mortgage interest rate for banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that they were doing that, when they went out of office that mortgage rate was 12 1/2 per cent, even though that was a sort of superficial number because, to get a decent home loan, you had to go out and cocktail it with personal loans to try to get the rest of your home loan as you could only get so much on the basis of that regulated rate. Of course, we were seeing the opposition, when they were in government, pursuing a system which gave us not only higher interest rates but also much less capacity at those regulated higher rates to actually get hold of a decent loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have now is a much better system&mdash;a system which is increasingly bringing benefits to home buyers and, importantly, putting increasingly more and more pressure on the banks to be competitive in relation to their variable mortgage interest rates. We can expect that development to provide increasing pressure on the banks and to provide increasing benefits to home buyers in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is required to secure that 200,000, roughly, number of jobs each year is economic growth in the order of 3 1/2 to four per cent&mdash;and that is what we are on track to achieve. That assumes, on the analysis that has been done by my department, even an increase in the participation rate&mdash;a record participation rate. So I am quite happy to defend the ability of this government to achieve its five per cent, based upon the forecasts that are in the budget and based upon where the trends are still signifying within the employment statistics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply say this: I have never argued, nor has the government, that the five per cent would be an easy target&mdash;never argued that. Of course it is going to be difficult, and it does depend on being able to secure the economic growth. But we are in a position, in economic management terms, where there is now increasing recognition of the ability to secure that economic growth in the region of 3 1/2 to four per cent. We have not been able to do that before. I think that is one thing that this government does need to be recognised for having achieved: sustained economic growth; low inflation; a wages accord that will underpin that low inflation; and a Working Nation program that will make sure that, as the economic growth continues, the long-term unemployed will not get left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other interesting dimension of the Working Nation programs is that, because we have been able to re-engage the long-term unemployed&mdash;that 20 per cent drop that I talked about before&mdash;we have seen not only an increase in the demand for labour but an ability to expand the supply. Of course, that is absolutely essential for keeping out inflationary pressures from any strong surge of growth in the economy. So the reality is that Working Nation is not just about social justice and about responding to the societal problems; it also makes great economic sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a government committed to the five per cent target and we will achieve it. It is a disgrace that on your side of the House you are prepared to give up before you even try. We will not give up. We will persist with what we have achieved to date and we will get there.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to report to the House that we are still getting very positive growth in the number of Japanese travellers coming to Australia. There is a slight decrease in our market share, but we are still getting an eight per cent per annum growth&mdash;something that is of great delight to the Australian tourism industry. But, because we would like to do better than that, we have had a summit, which has been taking place in Japan this week, of peak industry leaders from both the Japanese and Australian tourism industries, talking about ways that we can increase the number of Japanese travellers to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning on radio one of the participants in that summit, Mr Bruce Baird, the Managing Director of the Tourism Council Australia and a former minister in the Greiner and Fahey governments, accused me of having a blind spot on visas. He said that he was disappointed that I was not championing the cause of visa free travel from Japan to Australia. He cited the example of New Zealand and said that should be the model for Australia; that New Zealand had abolished visas for 32 different countries and that Australia should take the evidence from their success in promoting tourism to their country. Mr Baird argued that we should therefore adopt visa free travel to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, New Zealand is not a good example for Mr Baird to cite. As I have said, New Zealand has abolished visas for 32 different countries, yet since 1987 Australia has had an average annual growth rate of 18.8 per cent in Japanese travel to Australia, yet New Zealand has been able to achieve only 10 per cent. So Australia, by maintaining visas, has been able to achieve a growth rate almost double that of New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point to make is that, if we abolished the visas tomorrow, we would be simply moving the processing from the country of origin to the airport counters when people arrive. We would end up with massive queues at the airports, language difficulties and arguments with customs officials, and it would create all sorts of inconvenience for people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people on both sides of this House, including the honourable member for Moncrieff, who have argued that they would like even tougher character checks carried out because of concerns that they have about criminals and others who they believe might be coming to Australia on tourist visas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I make is that there should be a proper policy debate on this issue. The reason there should be a proper policy debate is that last Friday at the Australian tourism awards Mr Baird told me that the Liberal Party had told him that they had changed their policy before the next election and they would allow tourists from some countries to visit Australia visa free.</PARA>

We do not have a denial from Senator Parer certainly to date. But we do have a statement from Digger James saying that he was contacted by the Liberal Party and asked for his views and he told them that the RSL would be opposed to any relaxation of the visa policy. Certainly, Bruce Baird told me that the opposition was going to abolish them but then did a backflip, and Digger James has said that he was in the loop as part of this discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is a legitimate public policy issue, and we would like to know where the Leader of the Opposition stands on whether we should abolish visas for visitors to Australia. I think we have a right to know where he stands. But this is just another example of his weak leadership, where he will not tell us where he stands on this or other issues. The opposition start to head in a particular direction; they get some negative feedback; and they head in the opposite direction. He will not tell us where he stands on this or so many other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traditionally, we have had a bipartisan policy of support for universal visas. We would like to know whether the Leader of the Opposition is going to walk away from that policy. We certainly have not had any commitment from him as to whether they will be revisiting this issue before the election. All the evidence is there that they are flip-flopping all over the place on this particular policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has tried to make the issuing of visas as speedy and as easy as possible. We now have 16 countries where people can apply for visas through agents acting on behalf of the department of immigration. The department of immigration is working on a way to develop an electronic visa, almost an invisible visa, that can be applied for through the use of airline computer reservation terminals. That will make sure there is no detriment whatsoever in maintaining that visa policy by carrying out those character checks, by making sure that people coming to Australia are those whom we want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point I would make is that Mr Baird also called for a relaxation of the limits on foreign tour guides who are allowed to come to Australia. This is the area that I find most disturbing of all. At the moment, the reason the federal government and most of the state and territory governments are pushing the tourism industry is that it is about new jobs, especially for young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would you be out there arguing to relax one of the rules that keeps the pressure on the Japanese inbound companies to keep training young Australians to act as Australian tour guides? We are here trying to argue that more Australians should study Asian languages, should build up their skills so that they can get jobs in the tourism industry. So why would you be arguing to relax the rules that keep the pressure on them to do the right thing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today in the Senate, Senator O'Chee complained that the government should be getting tough on working visas. Yet we have Senator Parer running around saying that he wants to abolish tourist visas. On this, as on so many other public policy issues, we do not know where they stand. We do not get any leadership whatsoever from the Leader of the Opposition. It is time they stood up and told us where they were.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much for that question. There has been considerable progress on the question of native title and our relations with the states&mdash;not with all states, unfortunately. Yesterday I made a determination that the South Australian Environment, Resource and Development Court and the Supreme Court of South Australia would be recognised as state bodies for the purposes of granting native title. That means that applicants can go to those two courts to seek native title or, of course, come to the Commonwealth, as they would choose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also made two further determinations yesterday so that alternative right to negotiate processes could take place as they suit South Australia, sitting within the confines of the Commonwealth systems. This means that, if the South Australian government wants to compulsorily take land or if, in respect of mining activities, people want to get access to native title land or land that has been claimed, they can do so through South Australia's own system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a state, I remind you, that seven months ago had the Commonwealth before the High Court, wanting to deny the existence of the Commonwealth's Native Title Act. They have now nimbly, I might say, re-entered and given to us their own regime which yesterday I determined was acceptable to the Commonwealth government so that South Australians who wish to get access to native title land can, with due and proper regard to those who want to apply for native title or in fact have native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation Australia-wide is as follows on the question of native title: all states and territories have validated past actions according to the Native Title Act scheme and all governments, except Western Australia and the Northern Territory, have accepted the Commonwealth's financial offer. South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria have produced or are working on their own proposals to suit their own needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a major shift in the way in which people regard native title today, compared with the way people regarded it seven months ago. Now, most Australian states have accepted not only the fact of native title but also that the other issue&mdash;that is, people getting access to land, say for exploration&mdash;can be dealt with quite readily within the Commonwealth system. That shift is so much so that in Western Australia, the state that will not accept the Commonwealth's position, 81 per cent of all future acts&mdash;that is, things like granting a permit to explore on potential native title land&mdash;are accepted and are not being held up by the national Native Title Act processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us keep in mind that nearly all the states are now on board on the question of the grant of native title and access to that land.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. The minister would be aware that the Maritime Union of Australia has rejected outright the sale of ANL to P&amp;O. Will the government now put an end to the absurdity of giving the MUA a veto over the sale of ANL by making it clear that any strike action by the MUA will be strongly opposed by the government? Or will the sweetener to the MUA, foreshadowed by the Minister for Finance yesterday, now become a king-sized bribe to add to the $145 million already wasted by the government's incompetence? Why is the government prepared to waste even more taxpayers' money in an attempt to end the embarrassment of its bungled and incompetent handling of ANL instead of going to the cause of this fiasco by sacking the Minister for Transport, who is responsible for this complete and utter farce?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr TICKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. If there is one thing that distinguishes the government and the opposition, it is that on this side of the chamber we have a consistent series of policy reforms rolling out. Invariably, those policy reforms are directed towards social progress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I am pleased to answer the member's question by highlighting the fact that yesterday I issued a media release announcing the government's intention to proceed with some very significant reforms to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act which, in the main, are focused towards advancing issues of public accountability and openness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of amendments which will be the subject of consultation with indigenous people, including proposals for a register of pecuniary interests of regional councillors, the opening up of regional council meetings and the opening up of the papers and records of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, to the greatest practical and reasonable extent, to public scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to say that today I made it clear that the government would initiate a review of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act and that review would be undertaken by the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies in association with the Aboriginal Law Unit from the University of New South Wales and the North Australian Research Unit. I think it is important that there be a review of this act in view of the fact that it has been in existence for some 20 years. Despite some piecemeal reforms, I think there are very good reasons now why there ought to be such a comprehensive review of the act. Again, in part, that review will be directed towards enhancing public accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I can say to the honourable member that, pending the final outcome of that review, the government will seek to make some short-term interim, but nevertheless significant, amendments to that legislation to enhance public accountability. It would be the hope of the government that the opposition would support the necessary reforms to bring about that accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy is that the last time the opposition entered into debate on issues of public accountability in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs it was in the course of the land fund debate when the coalition advanced two main propositions, both of which were regressive and both of which were a blow against issues of public accountability because they effectively called for grants of land to individuals and then with no constraint, no limitations, on the ability of those individuals to sell the land. This government has a proud record of reform and reform directed towards social justice in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. But in doing so, we regard issues of public accountability as non-negotiable, unlike the opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) raised a matter of privilege in connection with reported industrial actions concerning the operation of certain members' electorate offices. In support of his argument, the honourable member referred to a newspaper report and a copy of what he said was a facsimile message sent to his electorate office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I read it, the newspaper report, which was dated 7 October, referred to an exchange between the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) and a Mr P. McKerrow in connection with industrial action. It also referred to the matter in dispute and it quoted comments by Senator McKiernan. The second document the honourable member referred to was a photocopy of a fax purporting to be from Mr McKerrow which appeared to urge electorate office staff members to support others in taking industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to advise the House that I have today received by fax a letter from Mr McKerrow stating that he believes the document tabled by the honourable member is a forgery and that he, Mr McKerrow, will be taking action to have the matter investigated.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That kind of confusion is what we have seen over the last 15 months under Working Nation. That kind of confusion is what has led to such a high degree of demoralisation amongst the young people of this country. Your policies, as everybody knows, have not been working. No-one knows that better than the members of your own department. Last year in September, a year ago, the Community and Public Sector Union stated quite clearly what was happening in the department. I quote what it said just in case anyone has forgotten:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result of this is the current chaos as DEET management try to frantically rearrange staffing resources to meet Case Management targets, as well as fudge statistics&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>these are the people employed by the department&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>A year later the union has again repeated these charges. They say in their September 1995 newsletter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have clear evidence that much of Working Nation isn't working.</PARA>
<PARA>The department is still telling the community that we can achieve things we just cannot. Both the minister and I recently attended the Jobs for Young Australians conference in Adelaide. I was very moved by the comment made there by Natalie Stansfield after hearing the minister, who was widely criticised to me, when I reached the conference, as having ducked away afterwards, not bothered to talk with the young people there and not waited around for questions or for consultation. He was in there with the official statement and out of there in his official car as quickly as he could. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message people gave me was very clear. They said, `We're sick of being shuffled through Simon Crean's training programs one after the other. We want real jobs.' We and of course they understand&mdash;even if you do not, Minister&mdash;that those jobs will come primarily from the small and medium sized businesses in this country. Natalie Stansfield said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are young, and maybe we are naive, but we are not stupid. We want meaningful work, not just meaningful words.</PARA>
<PARA>Meaningful work is not what is provided by the training programs and the subsidised employment programs, particularly this new work opportunities program that you are funding to the tune of billions of dollars. Young people in this country want genuine opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your staff have blown the whistle on you. Indeed, they ridiculed Working Nation. I can see today why they refer to you as `Squeaky'. It is this mad mouse problem. It has infected the entire structure of Working Nation. Sometimes it is up and sometimes it is down. We add a little bit here and we take off a little bit there. Everybody can have a good ride through these programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the rides increased last year. The amount of recycling went up and the number of people who were helped went down last year. In the first year of Working Nation, the bottom line&mdash;the line against which we assess Working Nation&mdash;was that that program helped fewer people and put them through poorer quality programs than the government provided in the previous year, the year before Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says that it has created 600,000 new jobs. I want to repeat this, Minister, because you obviously did not understand the question when you attempted to answer it in the House&mdash;and the Prime Minister of course had to get up and give an answer that he thought was a great deal better and a great deal clearer than yours. The government says that you have created 600,000 new jobs. But the recession destroyed 337,000 jobs and the new jobs that have come into existence, the net new jobs when you subtract that very substantial number of jobs which just went down the drain because of the recession we had to have&mdash;I want you to write this down&mdash;are not great enough to cope with the growth in the labour force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, unemployment has gone up. Five years ago, when the government went to the electorate in 1990, unemployment was 6.2 per cent. Now it has ratcheted up again to 8.5 per cent. Another quarter of a million people unemployed over the last five years! So when you and your leader are going around the country talking about this wonderful job creation, the people out there are thinking, `Hang on a moment. Isn't it more difficult to get a job now than it was five years ago?' They are right. Unemployment has ratcheted up again. As you know, job growth has now flattened off and long-term unemployment has gone up again, despite all the efforts of your programs to redefine the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your problem is that you treat unemployment as a statistical problem. You think that when you get to the election campaign the important thing is that the statistics look right, not that people have real jobs. You think the important thing is that either the statistics look right or people should not be allowed to see them at all. That is why you have stopped the publication of the regional youth unemployment statistics. Those statistics were giving a very clear message. That message was that there were many regions of this country where youth unemployment was up at 45, 55 and 65 per cent, and that is a statistic you did not like. You do not like those kinds of statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Behind every one of those statistics there is a tragedy; there is somebody wanting to start off on a decent life&mdash;and your programs are not helping them. You say, `Working Nation has created training. We've put lots of young people into our traineeships and apprenticeships. Commencements are the highest for three decades.' Let us look at the reality of that. The truth of the matter is that you get the numbers up only because the labour force has grown. But let us correct that. Let us look at apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the labour force. They are at the lowest level for three decades. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 10 years ago, Laurie Carmichael brought down <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Reconstructed</EMPHASIS>&mdash;you would remember that very well, Minister, because that was the document that linked training to your centralised industrial relations agenda, the fatal strategic decision that destroyed the training system in this country. What happened? You had targets then of 75,000 trainees a year. You never reached them. You never got above 15. The usual figure was nine. What did you try in Working Nation, this bold ambitious program of yours? What was your target? It was 26,500. What did you manage to reach, with all the bureaucratic chaos in that department&mdash;the chaos the union correctly identified? You managed to reach 16,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you looked at the unemployed last year, you thought one thing only: how can we get the numbers down, the statistics down? What is the best way to launder these statistics? So you set up a program. You thought: we will have a go at the long-term unemployed; we will have a go at getting that down. Nobody can dispute that a special effort was needed to help long-term unemployed people. We endorsed the fact that an effort should be made and was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what you did was to set up programs which created long-term unemployed people. You said, under your job compact strategy, `We're not going to admit people to these major employment programs until they are long-term unemployed; they'll have to wait around now until they're long-term unemployed.' Sure, these programs were set up, but you only focused on the other end of the queue. You thought: with these programs, we can redefine these people as short-term unemployed; we can take them off the other end of the queue because, after they have been through these programs, they no longer will be long-term unemployed&mdash;even though six out of 10 of them are unemployed again after participating in your program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are pumping people through these programs at a great rate. There were 20,000 people who went through your subsidised employment programs in June alone. Every month somewhere between 11,000 and 20,000 unemployed people are coming off these programs and they are all defined&mdash;those half or perhaps 60 per cent of them who do not have jobs&mdash;as short-term unemployed. No wonder these long-term unemployment figures have come down in the last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the problem has been that those figures have been stuck for the last five months. What is going on? A lot of other unemployed people who were short-term unemployed have now been forced to wait around until they are long-term unemployed before they qualify. So at the other end of the queue you have been turning people into long-term unemployed people. That is why the figures have been stuck. And that is why you have changed the eligibility guidelines in your announcements today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You know that we have been right. I identified that strategic flaw over a year ago.

I said, `Targets are not being met.' You said, `Oh yes, they are.' What happened to the jobstart targets? You set a target in Working Nation of 189,000. How many did you get?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I in fact welcome the opportunity that has finally been given to me by the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) to actually debate the success of Working Nation in its first year of operation. The member for Goldstein has been very quiet on that side of the House in asking questions. I saw him trying to get his darg up today. He actually got in three questions in a row. So congratulations to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple message that we have been conveying not just to the young people of this country but to the electorate at large is that we have an objective of getting unemployment down and we have a strategy to achieve that. The message is quite clear: we will achieve five per cent unemployment by the turn of this decade and we have the policies to do it. In the 2 1/2 years since we were returned to office, we have achieved 655,000 new jobs and a drop in the unemployment rate from 11.2 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Yet the member for Goldstein wants to ignore all of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never said that 8.5 per cent is where we should sit and that we do not need to do any better, and I have never said that the task of achieving our objective would be an easy one. We do recognise the magnitude of the problem, but we also recognise that, without active labour market programs actually out there assisting to get the long-term unemployed re-engaged, those long-term unemployed people will simply not have a chance in this recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stark reality is that in the recovery of 1983 to 1989 when this economy produced 1.6 million jobs under Labor, which the member for Goldstein wants to ignore in his additions, only 100,000 of those jobs went to the long-term unemployed. In this recovery, which has seen the creation of 400,000-odd jobs since Working Nation was introduced, some 140,000 jobs have already gone to the long-term unemployed. That is the difference between having the targeted measures that we have introduced with Working Nation and just leaving it to the marketplace. Those on the other side want to argue that they are concerned about the long-term unemployed, but they would do nothing to help them. They would not develop these proposals and programs to get them jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we introduced Working Nation, we had three objectives in mind: one, to reduce long-term unemployment and achieve that five per cent target; two, to boost the effort of entry level training to ensure that our young people were engaged in the work force as soon as possible after leaving school; and, three, to lift the skills of the nation. We all know that the jobs of the future are increasingly going to require skills, but what is the strategy in place to achieve that? Until Working Nation came along, there was no such thing as traineeships in all of those sectors in the economy which have produced the jobs. The big job growth sectors in the economy have been finance and banking, construction, the environment, sport, arts and entertainment and community services, but not one of those sectors had a traineeship before Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the argument is right that we have to develop the skills of people so they can compete for jobs, we need training programs in place so they can actually develop those skills. But the member for Goldstein would cut out all those training programs because he says they are useless. He says that they do not lead to jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind him of the fact that one of the most successful labour market programs is traineeships. Eighty-four per cent of people who go through a traineeship are in a job&mdash;an unsubsidised job&mdash;12 months after the traineeship is finished. That is the effectiveness of traineeships. The difficulty is, if you cannot get an apprenticeship or if you do not want to sign up to four years without knowing in advance whether you really want to pursue a certain vocation, how do you get into training? The whole exercise has been to open up the options for training in recognition of the fact that training increases employability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation came along and funded the places for additional traineeships but, most importantly, it has engaged industry in marketing those traineeships. All of the industry sectors are now actively behind the NETTFORCE operations marketing the traineeships. I mentioned before in the House the success we have had with small business traineeships. This is a program that the member for Goldstein would ridicule. But in New South Wales and Victoria over 1,000 traineeships were achieved, three months ahead of target. You say that people are not going into traineeships and apprenticeships these days. I do not know what rock you hide under when this information and these figures come out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that is terribly important to understand, and why it is essential that we keep young people involved in school and try to develop school as a more relevant means through which they can enter the work force, is the stark statistic that the chances of unemployment are twice as high for a person who does not complete year 12 as for a person who does. The difficulty these days is that until Working Nation came along we had no mechanism by which we were offering more choice in schools so that students could complete year 12 while actually getting a qualification that was recognised other than for entry to university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We developed the vocational training system. We ensured a means by which schools could offer subjects in years 11 and 12 that were not just recognised for entry to university but also recognised for entry to the workplace. We have seen all the writings, all the analysis, that says we have to use schools far more effectively. But relying on the states to do it was not producing the results. It was only when Working Nation came along that we had the leverage to develop this program because we funded a new initiative called the Student Traineeship Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the youth unemployment conference in Adelaide that the member for Goldstein referred to, I met with that group on three occasions. I do not go there just to lecture the people involved. I think they have a legitimate concern. They say, `We accept that training is important, we accept that training increases employability, but will the training lead to a job?' I think they are entitled to an answer, but that is why we developed and announced a month or so ago the school to work guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effectively, we have combined the vocational application in schools with the guarantee of a job for 12 months if they successfully complete. It did not need substantially new money; it needed the linking of programs. But the programs did not exist before Working Nation. We did not have the traineeship scheme or the Student Traineeship Foundation and we had not given greater encouragement to group employment and all those other initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also heard from the other side that this program has not produced the sort of flexibility that is needed to respond to enterprises in training. Before Working Nation the only form of training for the workplace was an apprenticeship and a structured traineeship. That required people to be off the job for two to three days a week, depending on the sort of training program they were in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not what small business wants. Small business does not know when it needs the peak load in its business. It cannot afford the disruption of people being away regularly for two days a week. But it does need the training. That is why there has been a big pick up in the small business traineeship. But when we developed the training wage we said that the training could be delivered on the job. That is why this small business traineeship has been so well picked up. It offers flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers can now take on young people and pay them a training wage, which is award and competency based. It has to lead to a qualification&mdash;not like the opposition's Austrain, which is completely poles apart&mdash;and must be accredited. Not only can employers get people under the training wage but also the training can be undertaken on the job. In addition to that, they can get access to a range of subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are offering employers these days is an ability to develop a person in the job as the business grows. They can have the option of the person working for one day a week or four days a week. It is up to the employer. There has never been a more flexible offer to employers in relation to training, skill development and employment. If they pick up the people through the skills program, they can employ them a day a week. Even if they cannot employ them a day a week fully themselves, through group employment we can offer them people to work&mdash;a practical application: getting training and skills at the same time&mdash;for part of the day. This never existed before Working Nation, so don't tell me that this has not been significant in terms of response. We have responded to the enterprise needs. We have responded to the individual needs. But, more importantly, we have responded to regional needs. </PARA>

In essence we say, `You know what your economic development strategies are. What Working Nation can do is to fund the employment and training needs to underpin that economic development.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar initiatives have taken place in Adelaide. It was interesting the other day when, speaking in Adelaide, Rupert Murdoch said how tragic youth unemployment was. I am reminded of the fact that the day I went over to Adelaide subsequent to that youth conference, we announced important new initiatives for Adelaide: 1,500 new jobs in the Salisbury area; a guarantee of employment for each year 12 student completing successfully vocationally; and 490 jobs in the automotive industry, 400 of them at GM at Elizabeth. Do you know where the Murdoch paper reported that? Page 21 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>. The point I am making is this: the regions are responding. The regions do understand the advantage and opportunity in Working Nation, and I am delighted they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Really, Working Nation is a national initiative which is regionally implemented. That is why it has been very successful. I do accept that we still have a long way to go, and we will get there because of the changes we have introduced today by way of listening to what the regions have been saying to us and adjusting the programs accordingly. I mentioned in question time the list of initiatives that had been undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say in conclusion that we will get unemployment down in this country by continuing the Working Nation strategy&mdash;by engaging and empowering individuals, enterprises and regions with the resources. But we will only get there with the combination of economic growth and the Working Nation programs. It is only this government that can keep delivering the growth, and it is certainly only this government that is committed to Working Nation. The only programs that have been nominated by the opposition when asked to identify where the cuts would occur are Working Nation programs, but the opposition's own backbench is out there saying, `Oh yes. We support Working Nation.' The Deputy Speaker says he supports Working Nation, but the opposition will not support the programs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why the changes today and a cabinet meeting held that others in the industry did not even know about? The minister needed to get these changes up. Why did he need to get these changes up? Because there is chaos in the government and panic and desperation are setting in. That is why Dr Russell is being brought home: they know there is an election around the corner and unemployment figures are going up, not down. So how can they now be fixed? The minister has said time and time again what a great success Working Nation is. On only 23 August, in response to a question here, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition, of course, says that Working Nation has been a flop. Some flop! The fact is that Working Nation is working, has worked to date and will continue to work.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet today he is admitting some of the failures and by the changes he is announcing is recognising that it has been, to some extent, a failure. I would argue that these changes represent the same theory as the sports rorts. Remember sports rorts just before the 1993 election? Money was thrown everywhere to get votes. After the election, when there were worthy programs in need of funding, there was nothing left in the kitty. Now, with money being thrown around desperately trying to get unemployment figures down, hopefully it will look better for the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the true extent of long-term unemployment? It has been argued, Minister, that you delude yourself or that you, at worst, mislead the public because Working Nation programs have allowed government to mask the extent of long-term unemployment. The long-term unemployed are removed from the register of unemployed, placed in labour market programs and at the end of the program are reregistered as short-term unemployed. It would seem from this that Labor's true aim is to reduce the statistical level of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national executive director of skillshare, David Thompson, recently told a Senate committee that it is not the number in programs that counts but rather the employment outcomes from these programs. Most current labour market programs leave six out of 10 participants in unemployment queues at the conclusion of the program. Between now and the next election you can just bet we will see more people being churned through these programs because that is the way unemployment figures will be tampered with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need economic growth and we need real job creation. Having people job ready will only work if there are jobs for people to go to. We need to be addressing the key, core problem, which is economic growth and true job creation. It is not good enough to shuffle unemployed people through training and labour programs which do not lead to sustainable jobs or bear any resemblance to the skills, qualities, expertise and aspirations of unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present 763,100 Australians are searching for work. But this number of unemployed is simply the tip of the iceberg because there is hidden unemployment in training and labour market programs and underemployment because there are so many people in part-time and casual jobs. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that over 500,000 part-time workers do want more hours. Over 100,000 people are so discouraged that they no longer register with the CES and over 600,000 people are waiting in education or training courses looking for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, in self-congratulation mode about unemployment figures, talks of unemployment coming down from that disgraceful level of 11.1 per cent to now 8.5 per cent. But 8.5 per cent is too high. The unemployment rate is rising from the low of 8.2 per cent in July. This is no time for the government to be celebrating. It is a government with no control over the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about school leavers? Do they have to wait around to become demoralised and demotivated before they are offered assistance? What about those young people hiding in our education system? I would agree, as the minister says, that it is good if those who can complete year 12 do so. But what about those who are being inappropriately kept at school longer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It sounds good to say young people should remain at school and be better educated. But keeping some young people at school longer is not necessarily good for them and an increasing number of professionals are saying it is setting them up for failure. It is a failure these people are experiencing that was not experienced by previous generations. When I entered the work force there was two per cent unemployment and many would argue that was full employment. I spoke recently to an executive of a large company who is earning in excess of $60,000 a year. He told me that he left school as a 15-year-old but was immediately able to gain practical experience and learnt everything he knew on the job. He is now concerned for his children. He is concerned that they are being kept in a system in which they are being set up to be failures. People need a fair go and they need real job experiences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of the costs of unemployment? I was relieved that in the minister's speech he mentioned the dimensions of unemployment. He mentioned drugs, crime and social and family breakdown when he spoke to the meeting this morning. He mentioned that these were in addition to the significant economic costs. I am pleased that these changes will allow job seekers with severe and multiple barriers to employment to be considered&mdash;barriers that include factors such as substance abuse and psychiatric or serious behavioural disorders. Apparently there are to be case management changes to design packages to assist these people. That would be a good thing because these are the types of issues that impact dramatically on families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people who are unemployed are far more likely to suffer from loss of esteem and lack of motivation. They are more likely to be victims of violence. They are more likely to be involved with drugs and crime, and young men, especially in rural areas, are more likely to commit suicide. The Prime Minister had an opportunity this afternoon when asked a question by the member for Port Adelaide about families, but I did not hear him say too much about that. In his usual arrogant style he was looking for an opportunity to bucket people on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are families in Australia for whom unemployment is a true tragedy, whether young members of their families are suffering and having an impact on the entire family or parents are worrying about how those children are going to be remotivated. As caring mothers in the Italian community in my electorate say, we need to have them in jobs; we need to have them occupied; we need to have them out of mischief. There are real tragedies for families and even more so when it is the parents who are unemployed and those children are being brought up in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> only a couple of days ago that the leading youth organisations were drawing attention to the massive social problems because of the thousands of young people who risk being unemployed all their lives. It was described as a national tragedy. Mr Michael Lynch, chief executive of Oz Child, said that the situation was akin to a national disaster. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If 250,000 people were stranded or injured as a result of a natural or man-made event, government would term it a national disaster and respond with alacrity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But where is the public outcry about the 250,000 young who are condemned to life on the fringe of society by lack of work.</PARA>
<PARA>He also argues about the extent of hidden unemployment in schools and the inappropriateness of some of this, and that young people between 15 and 24 account for more than 37 per cent of unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister claims to have listened to the consultative committees, and I commend him for that. I think that these consultative committees are doing quite a bit. But in our electorates we hear of tragedies. Young people write to us saying things such as:</PARA>

I have a friend who has one of these jobs and is getting the absolute minimum they can get for their line of work. I don't really think it is a fair thing. The other problem with this is that at the end of the period when the subsidy disappears so does the job. Why does everyone ignore this fact because it is really what happens?</PARA>
<PARA>The minister may congratulate himself on the success of some of these programs. He has claimed, as the Prime Minister has claimed, that the unemployment rate will reach five per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>

I am sure everyone is waiting for these words to see the member for Goldstein cringe and perhaps the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) cringe&mdash;in fact, for all the opposition to cringe. No, they are not cringing. I forgot: they do not have any shame. The journalist asked the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party this question:</PARA>

<PARA>What is that? A code for helping the unemployed? What is that? Compassion and care for the unemployed? What is that? An opposition trying to expand its assistance for the unemployed? Of course not. Do not give us that hypocrisy and cant. It is an opposition plan to slash assistance to the unemployed. That is what it is. It is a plan to cruelly crush the unemployed into despair.

You have to ask these questions because they do not give us any policies and you really have to examine what they stand for. If the opposition is elected, these people will be responsible for the assistance to unemployed people. The Australian electorate does not just need to know what I think or what the government thinks. It needs to know what independent people think of the leaders of the Liberal Party in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about Judge Olsen? In a judgment in the Supreme Court of South Australia, he cast severe doubts on the credibility of the Premier's testimony as a witness in the court. The case concerned a former chairman of the South Australian Health Commission, David Blakie, who was forced to resign shortly after the Brown government was elected. The judgment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the oral evidence unfolded, it rapidly became apparent that there were significant divergences in factual detail which arose as between the applicant (David Blakie) and the Premier (Mr Brown). In the event, I unhesitatingly prefer the evidence given by the former (Blakie) to that given by the latter (Brown).</PARA>
<PARA>There is more. The judge goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I entertain no doubt that the evidence given by him (Blakie) was both credible and accurate. He projected as a most impressive and dispassionate witness. He displayed an excellent recall of events. Moreover, the evidence which he gave was consistent both with that of the other key witnesses and certain documentary material.</PARA>
<PARA>Here is the critical part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am also of the impression that some aspects of his&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">evidence may have been influenced by a degree of ex post facto reasoning.</PARA>
<PARA>Isn't that a wonderful term for an untruth? My interpretation of that is that Mr Brown sought to mislead the court. That is exactly what is happening in this debate today by those opposite&mdash;ex post facto reasoning. Judge Olsen goes on:</PARA>

<PARA>The judgment is littered with such remarks about the Premier's behaviour. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What ultimately occurred was little short of unconscionable. The sanctity of contract (was) jettisoned to the four winds . . . the gun was pointed at his head.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the behaviour of the Premier of South Australia. He has been caught out doing some ex post facto reasoning in court. This is the leader who promised assistance to the unemployed by promising more jobs. It is not only Mr Brown who has been caught out attempting to deceive the electorate. I quote from Philip White's column in the Saturday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> of a few weeks ago. I am sure the member for Kingston, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, knows this quite well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is 20 years since the then Labor government acquiesced in the murder of five Australian journalists in East Timor. I would like to focus on the role of two key organisations in this sordid affair, the Defence Signals Directorate and the Department of Foreign Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DSD has a deservedly high reputation. From Shoal Bay in Darwin it meticulously monitored the Indonesian armed forces in Balibo, East Timor. DSD officials or their emissaries leaked information to selected Labor parliamentarians and journalists. They were understandably concerned at the Labor government's acquiescence in the murder of five Australian newsmen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DSD also informed the government that the decision to dispose of the bodies of the five murdered Australians was taken by the Indonesian field commander in Balibo. A former member of DSD, Mr Jim Dunn, has published two highly critical accounts of the Timor tragedy. As he is a close friend of Mr John Bowan, former international affairs adviser to former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and adviser to the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), Mr Dunn's critical accounts of the Indonesian role in this tragedy must be taken seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Its management mode can be summarised in two words: cover up. In 1976, a 20-page classified `secret' cable written by the then Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, Richard Woolcott, was leaked. He argued that Indonesia sought, and Australia should accept, its invasion and incorporation of East Timor. Predictably, DFA, as it then was, launched an internal inquiry. However, what is not publicly known is that the DFA officer in charge of the inquiry was himself responsible for the leaking of the Woolcott cable to the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, and DFAT spokesmen have in recent days stated that the truth of the circumstances surrounding the murder of the five Australian journalists would probably `never be known'. Senator Evans meant that the Australian people will never be told the truth. The grotesque attitude of the Department of Foreign Affairs to the murder of the five Australian journalists was summarised in their callous comments to Shirley Shackleton, the wife of one of the murdered journalists. In 1983, Mrs Shirley Shackleton published her account of her dealings with Foreign Affairs officials. Mrs Shackleton received a telegram from Foreign Affairs informing her that the Indonesians had sent for identification the `remains' of her husband and his murdered colleagues. In Mrs Shackleton's words, `The most the Australian doctor could say when he attempted an autopsy was that the remains were "possibly human".'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, a Foreign Affairs officer asked her whether she wanted the remains forwarded to Australia. She was informed that she would have to pay the costs of transport. Even more grotesquely, all the remains or bodies were in the same size box. Mrs Shackleton inquired as to the size of the box. The official stated that it was not very large. Mrs Shackleton inquired whether it was as large as a coffin or an overnight bag and the official replied `No'. After further questioning of the Foreign Affairs official, she was told that the box was `closer to the size of a shoe box'. To her credit, Mrs Shackleton refused to participate in this grotesque charade and the remains&mdash;which fitted into one small box&mdash;were buried in Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must demand a full explanation from the relevant Indonesian authorities as to the circumstances of the murder of the five Australian journalists. Above all, the Indonesian government should pay compensation to the relatives of the five murdered journalists. If we have the close and cordial relationship with Indonesia which the government claims, this should not be a difficult task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Jim Dunn and his close friend the Prime Minister's adviser, Mr John Bowan, are in an ideal position to assist in this process. It will certainly test whether the Australian-Indonesian relationship is strong, as the government claims, or whether Australia's acceptance of the murder of the five journalists will be the basis of its relations with Indonesia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The club gathered to celebrate winning the Geelong Football League premiership in 1995. The North Shore Football Club has a long and proud history in the Geelong Football League. The Seagulls have won many grand finals and this is the second one that they have won in two years. The festivities were especially exuberant because the club was celebrating a premiership win also by the reserves team in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I was very impressed by the professionalism of the club on this occasion.

One was the professionalism of the club and the second was the pride of the players and supporters in their achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The presentation took place in the club's newly renovated premises. I am particularly proud of the federal government's role in the renovation of the sporting facility. The House might like to know that the federal Labor government provided over $100,000 to the club through the cultural, sports and recreation program&mdash;a program which was basically knocked off by the Liberal opposition in this parliament. The grants that were provided to the North Shore Football Club have had significant benefits for the club. They have provided an upgraded facility and of course significant employment, both in the construction of the renovations and for people who were employed later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the club lodged its application under the cultural, sports and recreation program, we anticipated that around three full-time and three part-time people might be employed in the club as a result of the extension and the renovation. That figure now stands at 22, because the club has expanded its total area allocated to the restaurant. It now has a gaming area, and it has provided access for the disabled, and creche facilities for young families and young supporters of the club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, this club is now playing a very important role in the Norlane community in Geelong. It is a focus for entertainment, it certainly is a focus for sport and it is fast becoming a focus for socialising. The most important thing about it is that the money that the working people spend in this facility is staying in the Norlane area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pass on my congratulations to the president and the committee of the North Shore Football Club for their great achievement this year, and to the coaching panel. Coaching young players to premierships can be a difficult task, but it is obvious, both on and off the field, that these young players are really proud of the achievements of their club and they want to see its success continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the players go my congratulations. This is a major provincial football league in Victoria, and not many clubs in a major provincial league throughout the length and breadth of the state can claim to have won the first grade premiership and the reserve grade premiership in the one year. To the loyal supporters, who are very proud of their club, I say `keep that support going'. I wish the club every success in the future. </PARA>

Monitoring devices and reagents are all part of the best practice regime. Constant oral medication and/or injections are frequently employed in the control of the condition. I remind members that seven to eight tablets a day or four to five reagent tests a day are a quite common occurrence. When looking at a normal tablet allocation of 60 tablets on a prescription, we see that some patients would have to go to a chemist every seven or eight days to top up. </PARA>

This is a very important Scheme in allowing people access to vital supplies at reasonable cost.</PARA>
<PARA>Although that helps with syringes and with reagents, it does not cover all the medical costs. I have a letter here from Mrs Nicolson, the Secretary of the Bundaberg and District Diabetic Support Group Inc., about the self-imposed nature of the condition that some addicts have. Out of this self-imposed condition they get free syringes and free medical treatment, whereas diabetics, who did not inflict this condition on themselves, do not. She writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We as diabetics feel that we are being discriminated against, because unlike the drug addict, we did not choose our disorder and treatment for diabetes can be quite costly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of our members tell me that it costs them up to $100.00 a month for tablets and other items needed for the treatment and control of this disease. Other items include a blood glucose monitor and the testing strips needed for it and lancets for the finger pricking device, plus there are visits to a dietitian and podiatrist, neither of which are refundable under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We know that there is a PBS Safety Net scheme and that people are entitled to a concession card after paying the 407.60. But when you need three or four prescriptions filled at the one time every three weeks or less, it is a big drain on family finances until safety net requirements are met.</PARA>

It states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cooper asked Minister for Planning, Mr Rob Maclellan, whether he was aware of what he termed `the death bed conversion' of Federal Labor MP for Dunkley, Bob Chynoweth on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Suddenly on what appears to be the eve of a federal election, Mr Chynoweth has a death bed conversion and has started to tell people on the Mornington Peninsula that he is opposed to this degradation of the natural habitat and environment and has called for a moratorium on the construction of mobile telephone towers."</PARA>
<PARA>Robin Cooper, of course, is famous for what are called `Coopergrams'. When he was first elected to parliament he sent telegrams to all the members of his party, costing the state government thousands of dollars. He also attacked me in state parliament some time ago about the fact that I had said there was some toxic waste buried at Hastings. He said that I really did not know where it was and therefore it was just a stunt. So the next day I got up here, some years ago, and announced where it was. It was dug up and the owner of that land, who was a supporter of Robin Cooper, was fined many thousands of dollars and had to shift it. So he did a good job for him then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By raising this issue in state parliament, he also has done a job on his state minister. He has caused the minister to mislead the Victorian parliament. I will be asking for the minister's resignation, as he has misled parliament and caused a breach of the Westminster system and its fundamental principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go on and read what was said in state parliament. Mr Cooper referred to `Parliament in 1991'. He is talking about the debate on the Commonwealth Telecommunications Act, which was guillotined in federal parliament in 1991 by the Keating government. I did not think the Keating government was around in 1991; I thought it was the Hawke government. So there is his first mistake. Then he goes on about this death-bed conversion, et cetera. Then the minister, Mr Maclellan, responds. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Chynoweth, who in view of the impending federal election has had a death-bed conversion on the question of telecommunication . . . Mr Chynoweth is a loyal and supportive member of the federal Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA>That is correct. I am very proud to be that and I will always be that. Then he goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously, sensing the heat and anger of the people of the Mornington Peninsula and Frankston regarding this matter, Mr Chynoweth has now deserted his party on the issue and tried to palm himself off as having an independent view on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA>I was the first person to raise this matter in February 1994 in the House of Representatives. I was a member of a committee that gave advice to the minister for telecommunications; he changed the national code on 30 June 1994. So I have been around for quite a while working on this issue. Mr Maclellan goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When legislation was before the federal Parliament he supported it.</PARA>
<PARA>The legislation was there on 20 June 1991. I was not a member of parliament on 20 June 1991; I was on sabbatical for a couple of years. This is where Mr Maclellan has misled the parliament. He has taken advice from Robin Cooper, who is notorious for giving wrong advice. </PARA>

Of course, with the lack of adequate provisions, supplies and clothing, they were not looking good several weeks ago, before the most recent movements toward a cease-fire and having had only some bare relief during the siege which has taken place for the last three years. </PARA>

That is because they have intermittent electricity supplies and they have had no gas. Gas, as some members would know, has just been restored to the city after an absence of supplies for almost three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage this was a city that was dying&mdash;a city in which many of the people were living in a shell-shocked and emotionally disturbed state. I spoke to the Cardinal of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cardinal Pulic, who told me that he feared greatly for his people, who he believed had suffered so badly during three years that many had given up wanting to keep the city of Sarajevo alive. There seemed to be a spirit in the city of despondency so strong that many felt that the city would die. Notwithstanding the difficulties of leaving the city, there were people who were just quietly spiriting themselves away from what was one of the showpieces of a multicultural, multiracial lifestyle in the region. Of course, in the 1980s Sarajevo was the showpiece for the Winter Olympics in 1986. On the third visit I was very distressed to see just how much things had declined. </PARA>

Most people worked for the government in Sarajevo, of course formerly under a communist regime. Most have not been paid since the city has been under siege. In fact, the doctors and medical staff at the hospitals were receiving about $50 a month to provide them with the bare necessities, on top of being able to live in accommodation which was owned by the city of Sarajevo. Of course, they have no public transport anyway because it has been closed down. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill is long overdue. Its purpose is to amend the Crimes Act 1914 to implement the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission Report No. 2 on criminal investigation, submitted as long ago as 1975 and reaffirmed in greater detail, after a thorough examination of the issues, in the fifth interim report of the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law in 1991. Even in 1975, the ALRC was of the view that `the probative value of this kind of evidence is such that it ought to be obtainable and admissible, provided that enforceable safeguards for the accused are built into the system. Whatever else may be said about forensic evidence, nobody says that it should be ignored, and nobody says that it should be rejected as a tool of law enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law noted that there was no general Commonwealth law dealing with the medical or forensic examination of a person in lawful custody, and that the majority of state and territory laws merely authorised a medical examination where reasonable grounds exist to believe that an examination of a person will afford evidence as to the commission of the crime or offence involved&mdash;compare with section 353A(2) of the Crimes Act of New South Wales, section 236 of the Criminal Code of Western Australia and section 81 of the Summary Offences Act 1953 of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In such general provisions, doubt exists as to the extent of the power, even on the basic question of whether or not samples may be taken without consent. The recent Fernando case in New South Wales clearly demonstrates this. In that case, the two men charged with the murder of Ms Sandra Hoare refused to supply blood samples and challenged the New South Wales legislation. The New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal held that the legislation did not in fact authorise the taking of blood samples without consent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following this decision, an amendment was quickly made to enable blood, hair or saliva samples to be taken in New South Wales without consent, although no additional safeguards were added at that time. Indeed, the fact that safeguards vary between jurisdictions is of concern. Some of the current legislation contains virtually no safeguards at all. Other acts have basic protections such as examination by a medical practitioner, limitation on the presence of persons of the opposite sex during the examination and provision to the person of a copy of the report. Even the requirement for a court order is not consistently provided where there is lack of consent or where the use of force is required. For example, none is required in South Australia or Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for consistent and, if possible, uniform laws throughout Australia, especially those laws which profoundly affect the rights of Australian citizens in the criminal justice system, has been increasingly recognised during the life of this government. We have seen the passage of the foundation provisions of the Model Criminal Code, which is a major step in modelling a cooperative scheme for removing basic inconsistencies in principles of criminal responsibility throughout Australia. The Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Act 1994 performed the same function in relation to arrest and search powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time has now come for the Commonwealth to grasp the nettle which has been enjoying largely uncontrolled growth for more than 20 years and apply the same principled and balanced regulation to the role of forensic science in the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. It is clearly wrong, when as a nation we are rightly proud of our record of freedom and justice in a world where, sadly, neither of those things can be taken for granted, that different rules may apply to different groups of Australians depending purely on where they live, some of those rules being uncertain or oppressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Model Criminal Code Officers Committee, which is the body working towards a uniform criminal code to be adopted by all Australian jurisdictions, prepared a model forensic procedures bill which was widely circulated for comment to about 600 groups and individuals, representing many interests&mdash;defence lawyers, investigators, prosecutors, judges, academics, law societies, bar councils, civil liberties groups, human rights organisations, women's groups, victims groups, legal aid organisations, government departments and interested individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Commonwealth commenced its own consultation process, a revised bill was again circulated. Over 60 submissions were received, analysed and, as far as practicable, recommendations were incorporated into the bill. Few submissions advocated the complete abandonment of the exercise. Most were concerned with striking the correct balance between the civil liberties of the individual and the requirement for the police to have adequate investigative powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee's bill and the Commonwealth bill are modelled on the Victorian legislation, which in turn implemented the recommendations of the Victorian Consultative Committee on Police Powers of Investigation. I would say that seldom has a proposal requiring a delicate balance of civil liberties and law enforcement concerns been subjected to such a degree of scrutiny prior to its introduction to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now describe the effect of the bill and the proposed government amendments. First, I wish to clarify that nothing in this bill prevents the police requesting non-suspects to undergo forensic procedures, as sometimes occurs, in order to narrow the field of investigation. The proposed legislation applies only to suspects as defined in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike most of the current state legislation, but consistently with the Victorian provisions, the Commonwealth bill makes a clear distinction between intimate and non-intimate forensic procedures. Intimate forensic procedures consist of the external examination of the genital or anal area, the buttocks&mdash;in the case of a female, the breasts&mdash;and the taking of an intimate sample, namely, blood, saliva, a buccal swab, pubic hair, and samples taken by swabs, washing, scraping or suctioning or the taking of a cast or photograph or lifting by tape from previously described intimate areas.

I should note that where a person is in lawful custody the applicable law for the taking of fingerprints, footprints and palm prints is found in part IAA of the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to those safeguards providing appropriate protection of a person's privacy and dignity which are common to all forensic procedures&mdash;of which I will speak later&mdash;unless a suspect gives his or her informed consent after receiving all relevant information, including the right to refuse, all of which must be recorded, no intimate procedure may be performed except by order of a magistrate. However, if a person is in lawful custody, non-intimate procedures may be carried out by appropriately qualified persons as ordered by a constable. These orders are subject to the same conditions as apply when a magistrate makes an order, and can only be made if the non-intimate procedures can be conducted within the custodial time limits provided in part 1C of the Crimes Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also specifies that, in considering the justification of any order, the magistrate must balance the public interest in obtaining evidence relevant to the offence against the public interest in upholding the physical integrity of the suspect. It enumerates a number of matters relevant to that balancing of interests, including any practicable alternative means of obtaining evidence and any reasons given by the suspect for refusing to consent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A court order is required not only for intimate procedures where the suspect does not consent but also for non-intimate procedures where the non-consenting suspect has not been arrested; where a suspect is unable to give informed consent by reason of youth or mental incapacity; or where the part 1C custodial time limits have expired, or will expire, before the proposed procedure can be completed. The criteria to be taken into account are the same in each case. </PARA>

However, urgent interim orders may be sought from a magistrate to carry out a forensic procedure which must be done without delay; for example, where the sample to be taken is of a highly volatile or perishable nature. Such applications may be made by any electronic means, but the suspect and his or her lawyer&mdash;or interview friend, for those categories of persons warranting special support&mdash;must be given an opportunity to communicate with the magistrate. </PARA>

Any sample obtained as a result of the interim application may not be analysed unless it is perishable. If it is analysed, the results may not be disclosed to any person unless a final order is obtained.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of performing forensic procedures without consent on suspects who may or may not have been arrested for the relevant offence has aroused strong feelings in many who provided submissions in the consultation process. It will no doubt concern many of my parliamentary colleagues; and I, too, have deliberated over it at great length. However, in the government's view, it is justified for the following reasons. The criteria, which I just quoted in some detail, set a very high standard, and the magistrate must be satisfied that these are met before making an order for procedures to be performed without consent. There must be evidence before the magistrate providing reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect committed the offence. If the magistrate is satisfied on this ground, then he or she must also be satisfied that the procedure is likely to produce probative evidence and, even if it is, that the conduct of the procedure is otherwise justified. That means that the forensic procedure cannot be sought by the police merely as a fishing expedition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Commonwealth law, arrest is a step of last resort. As well as the common law criteria for arrest, other conditions apply. Unless a constable&mdash;or, in the case of a warrant, a magistrate&mdash;believes on reasonable grounds that proceeding by summons would be ineffective to ensure the appearance of the person before the court or to prevent further criminal acts, including the destruction or fabrication of evidence and the harassment of witnesses, a lawful arrest cannot be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, apart from strictly legal justifications, I believe that it is quite reasonable, in the interests of effective law enforcement, to request&mdash;and, if necessary, to require&mdash;suspects to undertake relatively simple procedures, either to exonerate themselves or to provide evidence that could confirm their involvement in a relevant offence. For example, a man who is a prime suspect in a rape case may decline to provide a sample of saliva or blood to enable a DNA match with semen found on the victim. There is little difference in principle between evidence obtained in conducting forensic procedures and evidence obtained by means of a search warrant. I simply do not see why, as in the Hyland case in Tasmania, it should be thought justifiable for police to have to wait 10 years, and for the victim's family to suffer an unresolved situation for 10 years, because a suspect refuses to consent to a forensic procedure and the law has no power to require him to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides a comprehensive scheme for obtaining forensic samples from adults, children under the age of 18 years, and persons incapable of managing their own affairs. It sets out the powers and obligations of police when carrying out the procedures, and details the many safeguards to protect the rights of individuals, with particular provisions for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, children and the incapable. These include the right to an interpreter and the provision of full information about the relevant procedure and the suspect's rights in a language likely to be understood by the person; the right to be present at an application for a coercive procedure to be authorised, to be represented, make representations and to cross-examine; and the right to have a medical practitioner, chosen by the suspect, present during most procedures, a medical practitioner of the same sex, if practicable, limitation on the numbers of constables that may be present during the carrying out of a forensic procedure, and restriction of the presence of opposite sex constables to cases of necessity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where reasonable force is permitted to obtain a sample from a non-consenting suspect, the bill expressly prohibits that being done in a cruel, inhuman or degrading manner, and also provides that procedures must be conducted in accordance with proper professional standards. Additionally, the bill makes it clear that nothing in the part requires a medical practitioner or dentist to carry out a forensic procedure, even though an order may have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further safeguards will be included in the bill by the government amendments which will insert a maximum limit of four hours as a reasonable time for which a suspect can be detained for the conduct of the procedure. As in part 1C, certain time is excluded in calculating the expiry of the four-hour limit. Such time includes waiting for the suspect's interview friend, lawyer or doctor to arrive or allowing the suspect to communicate with a friend, relative, lawyer or interpreter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as introducing time limits, the new part repeats those safeguards provided to arrest of persons under part 1C which are applicable to the conduct of forensic procedures. These include the right of certain suspects to interview friends; the right of all suspects to contact a lawyer and to communicate with that lawyer in private wherever possible; the right to an interpreter where necessary; and tape recording of requests for consent and the conduct of procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in my view, a most potent safeguard in the present bill is provided by the legislative barrier to admissibility of evidence which is obtained from forensic procedures which are carried out in breach of the legislation. If there is any breach, the prosecution must justify to the court that there are good reasons why the statutory scheme was not followed. In such a case, the probative value of the evidence will not, by itself, justify its admission. The bill indicates a number of matters which the court must take into account in considering whether to admit such evidence, including the gravity of the contravention and whether it was intentional or reckless. Evidence is also inadmissible by the prosecution, with no discretion on the part of the court, where material was not destroyed in the circumstances required by the legislation. There are comprehensive requirements for the destruction of forensic material and inadmissibility of evidence derived from it, where proceedings have not been commenced within a certain period or where they have been finally determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should like to mention three further points which have caused some concern. The first is the provision which permits the fact of a person's refusal to comply with any reasonable direction for the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a person, given by an authorised person, to be admissible in any proceedings against the person in a court, provided he or she has first been warned of that possibility. That is, admissibility is not limited to proceedings for non-compliance with a court order, or obstructing an officer in the course of his or her duty, but is admissible in the proceedings for the offence for which the forensic procedure was required. Accordingly, it is open to the jury to draw an inference from the person's refusal to permit the taking of the sample, which could involve the conclusion that the person had reason to fear the result of the procedure. One could, no doubt, imagine innocent reasons for resisting certain procedures, and these could be cogently put to the jury by the defence, with supporting evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I believe that, where serious offences carrying heavy penalties are involved, without some serious consequence rendering non-compliance of doubtful value, a mere non-compliance offence with the usual low penalty would be an ineffective deterrent. It could defeat the value of the coercive provisions in the legislation&mdash;the penalty a price willingly paid by a guilty suspect to avoid the availability of damning evidence of the more serious offence and there would be little point in proceeding with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter is the retention and use of forensic material. There are two aspects to this. The bill provides for a database to be set up and maintained for statistical purposes. That database must be designed in such a way that the information contained in it cannot be used to identify any individual on whom a forensic procedure was carried out. Such a database will be used for a purely scientific purpose to develop norms against which the degree of probability that any particular forensic material came from a particular person can be assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect is the requirement that information about a person obtained from a forensic sample taken under the bill may not be recorded or retained in a personal records system if that sample is required by the bill to be destroyed. However, nothing in this bill affects the taking, retention, or use of a forensic sample, or of information from that sample, where that is authorised by another law of the Commonwealth or of a state or territory. It is not intended to repeal any other Commonwealth provisions that might exist, although these can if necessary be revised in due course, nor is it intended to create any inconsistency with existing state-territory provisions. It is expected that these will be revised as state-territory legislation is developed to build up a national uniform scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I will briefly address criticisms that forensic evidence in recent years has fallen into disrepute, that it is not infallible, and that juries, blinded with science, may give disproportionate weight to evidence of dubious validity. However, as I noted previously, no-one suggests that its use should be abandoned and almost everyone acknowledges its value when properly used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I wish to say on that issue is that the present bill is concerned only with the procedural aspects of collecting and using forensic material. The procedures which are currently available are subject to varying, often minimal, safeguards. This bill aims to balance the need of law enforcement to have access to an investigative resource, which is constantly being developed and refined, as against the right of the individual to live free of arbitrary intrusion by the state, and free of arbitrary interference with his or her physical integrity and dignity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The products of the procedures provided by the bill, like the products of any other investigative technique, are weighed and evaluated as they pass through each of the filters provided by our criminal justice system: first by the investigators themselves, then by the prosecutors and their experts, then by the defence and its experts, and finally by the jury. Like all other evidence, it is subjected to the rigours of the adversary procedure. Experts are examined and cross-examined, the judge directs the jury on the applicable law and the standard of proof which must be satisfied, and the jury considers its verdict, taking into account all other evidence admitted as relevant in the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the view that this bill is bad and should be rejected because forensic evidence is less than 100 per cent reliable were applied to all evidence, the criminal courts would be cleared and no-one would ever be convicted. The standard of proof that is applied by the jury in a criminal trial is `beyond reasonable doubt'. That is a high test. In my opinion we must do the best we can with the means currently available to us. We must neither sacrifice civil liberties for expediency, nor reject available investigative techniques because they fall short of the standard of perfection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only financial implications arising from the bill involve minor costs associated with training which will be absorbed in the normal budgets of relevant agencies. Other aspects of the bill are described in the explanatory memorandum and a detailed description of the government amendments are contained in the supplementary explanatory memorandum which I now present.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will endeavour in my remarks to outline some concerns about the way in which the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 1995 is being handled by the government and our response to those procedures and then offer some comments of a preliminary nature in relation to the bill itself. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) enunciated in his second reading speech, this bill has a been a long time coming. I note that these matters were first raised in 1975, very early in the Law Reform Commission's days, in the Australian Law Reform Commission report No. 2, and reaffirmed in greater detail, after thorough examination of the issues, in the fifth interim report of the Review of the Commonwealth Criminal Law in 1991. So these matters were first raised in 1975, were the subject of further elaboration in 1991, and have been the subject of a number of other reviews and comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders why, in the context of the government having taken positions which were beyond the recommendations of many of its expert bodies that have given advice in developing this bill, we are being pressed to debate this bill in this chamber today when it is well known that an inquiry has been instituted by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. That committee was due to report yesterday but because of the difficulty in completing its work it has obtained an extension of time to undertake its deliberations and it is now to report by 26 October, next Thursday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that the Senate, through its committee, has been able to have a detailed examination of the bill. It has been able to hear from ministers, from the Law Council, presumably from other groups interested in privacy such as the councils of civil liberties, and from other interested bodies. However, this chamber, the House of Representatives, as is usual in relation to legislation involving the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), has not been able through its committees to undertake a similar review for the purposes of considering the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are asked, in the House of Representatives, to debate the bill, to allow it to have a second reading, and to consider government amendments before we have had the benefit of the Senate committee's observations on this bill. Why is that the case? Why the haste? Why is the House of Representatives to be excluded from this process, particularly when the bill has been in genesis since 1975? Is it suddenly so urgent that a week is going to matter? Just to say that out aloud demonstrates the patent nonsense involved in the timetable that the government has set. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did endeavour the other day to give the government an opportunity to put this matter off and not refer it to this committee and to have the second reading postponed until the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee has reported to the Senate on the bill. We were not successful in that. The government used its numbers, notwithstanding what I believe would be the many doubts in the minds of some of its members about the efficacy of this particular legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to give government members another opportunity to reconsider this matter and I will be moving:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"the debate on the second reading of this Bill be adjourned, and the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for the first sitting following 26 October 1995".</PARA>
<PARA>We will ask that that vote be taken at the conclusion of the speeches from those members who are listed here today to participate in this debate. That will give others, who may, as a result of the Senate committee deliberations, want to participate on the basis of that available information, an opportunity to do so, and it will enable the more important consideration in detail stage to be deferred until we have the Senate committee report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will ask that after the vote is taken in this place, which I gather has to be on the voices, the matter be referred back to the House of Representatives to enable a division to be taken. In that way we can see whether or not those members of the government who are interested in the civil liberty issues have something further to add. It is unlikely that they will want to disagree with the government but at least people should be given the opportunity to turn their minds to these issues. We will see whether they are bona fide when they speak to us in hushed tones about their concerns and whether they want to see a full debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude in relation to the handling of this issue by saying that we are exceedingly disappointed at the way in which the Minister for Justice has dealt with this issue. I am disappointed additionally that the parliamentary secretary has left the chamber. The minister had the good sense, when the shadow Attorney wrote to him inviting him to postpone the consideration of this matter until after the Senate committee deliberations, to concur that that was an appropriate course to follow. But, when the committee was not able to complete its deliberations within the time frame initially anticipated to be met, the Minister for Justice came to a different view and wanted this timetable pressed. He gave us written advice that he would defer it in order that the principled course would be followed but, when the reporting date went back, he did not continue that approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just note, when we look at the list of speakers who are to contribute to this debate, that, notwithstanding our knowledge of the very considerable interest in this matter amongst government members, none have been prepared to come into the chamber and speak in the second reading debate in support of the government's bill. It is particularly interesting that, when we have a committee on legal and constitutional affairs which includes many highly qualified members of the legal profession who take an interest in these matters, some of them on the government benches, not one of them has seen fit to add their name to the list and to contribute to this debate. As I proceed to speak about the bill itself, it will become apparent why those who have a genuine interest might be silent at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take members firstly through the background of the legislation that is before us. At common law, there is no power to compel a suspect to provide body samples. The right of every person to maintain their bodily integrity is a long stated principle of law, and was recently reaffirmed in the High Court in 1992 in Marion's case. The current state and territory laws relating to forensic procedures are vague and the safeguards are varied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, quite a number of inquiries have been constituted to look at the questions of police powers and procedures in relation to forensic samples being taken. These include the Australian Law Reform Commission report on criminal investigation in 1975; a report on body samples and examinations in 1989 by the Victorian Consultative Committee on Police Powers of Investigation, known as the Coldrey committee; the fifth interim report in 1991 of the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, known as the Gibbs committee; and the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission's report of 1994. In a number of significant respects, this bill gives police greater powers than those recommended by these various reports. In other words, the government in this proposed bill is going beyond the recommendations of the experts who have deliberated long and hard on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the parliament is based upon the model provisions developed by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. I do not know whether we have an acronym for that, but it is a very interesting long title. The final form of the bill was determined by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, presumably after the officers had presented them with appropriate recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill's provisions deal with what are termed intimate forensic procedures&mdash;and we heard a good deal of that being outlined in the second reading speech of the parliamentary secretary&mdash;and, separately, with non-intimate forensic procedures. The intimate forensic procedures include the taking of blood, the taking of dental impressions and procedures involving the genital areas and, in the case of women, their breasts. Non-intimate procedures include the taking of fingerprints, the taking of non-pubic hair and other less intrusive procedures not involving the genital areas. The scheme of the bill is to impose greater controls over the taking of intimate forensic procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill draws distinctions between adults in custody; adults not in custody; incapable persons; and children under 18, whether or not they are in custody. In proposed section 23W there are various requirements for taking forensic procedures. I will not elaborate on the detailed outline given by the parliamentary secretary, save to say that the procedures are different, depending upon whether or not a person is in custody, not in custody, incapable or a child under 18 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill stipulates the persons who may carry out a particular forensic procedure. Depending upon the procedures, those persons may be a medical practitioner, a nurse, a dentist, a dental technician or an appropriately qualified person. In addition, in respect of most forensic procedures, the bill entitles the suspect to request the presence of a medical practitioner or dentist of the suspect's choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reaction to the bill has ranged between full support; support as to the concept, but concern over the substance of the bill in particular areas; and outright opposition. Those expressing a reaction in the last category have claimed that the bill is an inappropriate invasion of the civil liberties of individuals and has potentially discriminatory effects upon Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders and children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the view of the opposition the bill is not, in its broad terms, objectionable. As I noted, inquiries have recommended the enactment of a number of comprehensive laws dealing with police powers and forensic samples. However, any legislative scheme must appropriately balance the need to authorise the gathering of probative evidence against unnecessary intrusion on individual rights. Many claim that the balance has not been appropriately struck in this legislation. I will take the Committee through a number of the concerns that we have had expressed to us in relation to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, in authorising the taking of forensic procedures before a person has been arrested, the bill gives police powers contrary to the recommendations of the Gibbs committee and the Coldrey committee. The explanatory memorandum and now the second reading speech seem to justify this provision on the basis that the criterion for authorising the taking of a sample requires the police to believe that there are grounds to arrest the person. In fact, the criterion for authorisation is that the constable suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has committed the offence. That is lower than the standard for arrest, which requires a belief as opposed to a suspicion. If those forensic procedures were being undertaken before a person had been arrested, that would occur on a lesser standard than would be required for the person to have been arrested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the bill authorises a constable to order a non-intimate forensic procedure if the suspect does not consent. Again this extension of police powers is contrary to the Law Reform Commission's recommendations and the recommendations of the Gibbs committee and the Coldrey committee. The Australian Law Reform Commission believes that such procedures should not occur without a court order. It has been argued that, if police are to have such powers, they should only be exercised by more senior police, for example police officers of the rank of sergeant or higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the bill applies to indictable offences, which means an offence punishable by imprisonment for more than 12 months. A number of bodies have claimed that this would allow the use of procedures for offences that are really of a minor nature. The Australian Law Reform Commission has recommended that the power to compel forensic procedures should be limited to `serious offences', for example offences punishable by a maximum penalty of five years or more imprisonment. It has been claimed by the Attorney-General's Department that this would confine the bill too narrowly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, it has been suggested that the operation of the bill should be subject to a regular and systematic audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, it has been argued that the bill should include offences for exercising or threatening to exercise the powers contained in the bill without following the proper procedures. In other words, there should be some offences to deal with those who do not follow the procedures that the bill says ought to be followed. The provision in the bill which removes civil and criminal liability has been the subject of criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where a suspect resists the taking of a sample, the bill would allow a court to form an adverse inference from that resistance, notwithstanding that the sample was obtained. The Law Council of Australia and the Law Society of New South Wales object to such an inference being drawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill allows for the taking of swabs and photographs of breasts. It has been argued that it is difficult to imagine an offence where forensic evidence could be obtained by such means. It has been suggested that the bill is likely to disadvantage those in outback areas. In these areas it will take much longer to obtain authorisation and assemble persons to undertake and supervise the procedures. It is argued that this will increase time in custody. While the government has indicated that it intends to introduce amendments that will specify the maximum time limit of four hours for detention, the requirement that `dead time' be discounted will still make those in isolated areas worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the bill contains specific protections in respect of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, Aboriginal groups have criticised the extent of those safeguards. It has also been noted that in order to be consistent with the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, the maximum time for detention should follow the precedent of section 23C(4) of the Crimes Act of 1914 and limit the detention for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to a maximum of two hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill gives a magistrate a general power to arrest a person for the purposes of giving a sample. In relation to the application of the provision to children, it has been argued that there should be no power to arrest a child unless there has been an attempt to have that child attend by way of summons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to intimate forensic procedures, the bill provides that `if practicable' the procedure should be carried out by a person of the same sex as the suspect. It has been strongly argued that in the case of children the same sex requirement should be mandatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been argued that, as the reliability of dental impressions is questionable, the bill ought not to authorise the taking of dental impressions. The Coldrey committee was not persuaded that sufficient justification existed for the taking of dental impressions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, a number of provisions which specify those persons who may conduct the forensic procedure refer to `an appropriately qualified person'. Such a person is to be determined by regulations. The Law Council of Australia quite properly believes that such an open-ended procedure is inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these issues have been raised with the Senate committee. They are issues upon which that committee might well be expected to make recommendations. As a result of those deliberations, a number of the issues clearly require further consideration by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the taking of these procedures is in the hands of the police, it is particularly important to note that the bill does increase police powers in a climate where serious questions are being raised about the exercise of police powers. It is particularly significant that, at a time when even the Australian Federal Police have been the subject of some adverse comment in the Wood royal commission in New South Wales, we are pressing this matter. I do not want to canvass matters in relation to the Australian Federal Police in any detail, except to say that the bill is to be adopted by all jurisdictions. This is a model code for application in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever one might think about allegations of Australian Federal Police potential involvement in corrupt and other activities, the comments that have arisen as a result of the Wood royal commission must serve to raise very considerable doubts in the minds of those who are deliberating on this matter. The unseemly haste is something that this committee needs to note and take into account in its deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's approach is not to oppose the bill. Our objections are in relation to the procedural issues that I have outlined. In another place where the government does not have the numbers I suspect that the bill will not receive a speedy passage and that there will be a great deal of time to deliberate in the Senate on the contents of the Senate committee's report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 1995 is to establish a regime for carrying out forensic procedures during the investigation of Commonwealth offences and for the storage, use and destruction of forensic materials so obtained. The effect of this bill is to extend the powers of police officers to take body samples and prints from&mdash;and photographs of&mdash;people in custody and people who are suspects but who are not under arrest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subject of police powers and forensic samples has been dealt with by a number of inquiries in Australia and overseas. The Australian Law Reform Commission looked at the issue in its 1975 report on criminal investigation. The Victorian Consultative Committee on Police Powers of Investigation, also known as the Coldrey committee, published its report on body samples and examinations in 1989. The Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, better known as the Gibbs committee, produced a report dealing with the subject in 1991. Finally, the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission published a report which made recommendations on the subject of forensic procedures in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these reports, the subject of police powers and criminal investigation was examined by the New South Wales Law Reform Commission in 1987, the Criminal Law Committee of New Zealand in 1978, the royal commission on criminal procedures in England, and the Law Reform Commission of Canada in 1985. These committees made a range of recommendations regarding the nature of the forensic procedures, the circumstances in which they should be able to be conducted and the protections required to preserve the dignity and civil liberties of the suspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Model Criminal Code Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General&mdash;and I hope to goodness that there is no acronym invented for that&mdash;then developed model provisions for a forensic procedures bill. Those provisions became the model forensic procedures bill which was released as a draft for consultation and comment in early 1994. Then in January 1995 the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee circulated an amended model forensic procedures bill. While the model bill was welcomed by the Australian Federal Police, it attracted strong criticisms from civil liberties groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill we are debating today, which was introduced in this House on 29 June this year, was settled by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, but it differs in some respects from the model forensic procedures bill circulated earlier this year. Although the explanatory memorandum states that the bill draws heavily on the recommendations of the Coldrey report, the bill differs in significant respects from the recommendations of that report and of the reports of some of the other committees of inquiry that reported on the issues. I will return to these differences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill would, first, authorise the police to conduct intimate forensic procedures on an adult in lawful custody, either with the informed consent of the adult or, failing that, by order of a magistrate. Secondly, the bill proposes to extend police powers to allow non-intimate forensic procedures to be performed on an adult held in lawful custody, with that person's informed consent, or by order of a police constable or of a magistrate. Thirdly, the bill authorises the police to conduct forensic procedures, both intimate and non-intimate, on adults who have not been taken into lawful custody, either with the informed consent of the suspect or, failing that, by order of a magistrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the use of forensic procedures on a mentally incapable person, the bill proposes that an order be obtained from a magistrate, whether the person is held in custody or not. Similarly, the bill would allow the use of forensic procedures on a child under 18, whether or not held in lawful custody, but only on the order of a magistrate. The forensic procedures described in the bill vary from the taking of body samples, such as hair and saliva, to taking dental impressions and fingerprints, and include the taking of photographs of parts of the body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the bill was introduced into and has not yet passed through this House, on 28 August this year the Senate referred the bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The Senate committee was due to report on 25 September 1995. That date was then extended until 18 October and the report date was again extended, from Tuesday, until 26 October, which is Thursday next week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of the many concerns raised about the bill in its public hearings, the Senate committee is likely to recommend a number of changes to the bill. The government will need time to respond to the committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes very important changes to police powers and is designed as a model to be adopted by other jurisdictions. It is therefore important that this House should be debating the legislation after the committee has tabled its report and after the government has responded. At the very least, this House should have the benefit of the committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister did in fact agree to that, as was pointed out by the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) this morning and as was pointed out in the debate on Tuesday, 17 October, on the motion to refer this bill to the Main Committee. I urge the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) to ensure that debate of this bill is adjourned in accordance with the motion moved by the member for Berowra until after the committee has tabled its report on the proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the bill is not opposed, the coalition does have a great many concerns with the detail of the bill, especially with the issue of the appropriate balance between the needs of law enforcement and the protection of civil liberties. This concern is reflected in the differences between the provisions of the bill and the recommendations of the various reports which led to the bill. It can also be seen clearly from concerns which have been raised publicly concerning the bill, both before the Senate committee and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the differences between the bill and some of the inquiry recommendations is that the bill will permit police to conduct forensic procedures on a person before arrest and without the person's consent. This is contrary to the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission, the Gibbs committee and the Coldrey committee. It is a significant extension of police powers, and I will say a bit more about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also proposes to allow the police to conduct non-intimate forensic procedures on a person held in custody without the suspect's consent to the procedure and on the order of a police constable. This, too, is contrary to the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission, the Gibbs committee and the Coldrey committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By its inclusion within the definition of an intimate forensic procedure, the bill will give police the power to obtain dental impressions. The Coldrey committee recommended against giving police this power, on the basis of the unreliability of bite mark evidence. Similarly, the Coldrey committee noted that hair samples do not provide a reliable means of identifying a suspect, and that about 100 strands are required for testing. However, the bill would permit the taking of a sample of pubic hair as an intimate forensic procedure and the taking of a sample of any other type of hair as a non-intimate forensic procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I propose now to refer to some of the concerns expressed about the detailed provisions of the bill. I cannot, of course, refer to the conclusions reached by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee as the result of its inquiry but, as I said, I anticipate that the Senate committee will have regard to those concerns and that its report will recommend amendment of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already noted, the definition of `suspect' in connection with an indictable offence includes persons in addition to those charged with the offence and those summonsed to appear in court in relation to the offence. It includes a person whom a constable suspects on reasonable grounds has committed the indictable offence. This is a lesser test than that required before there will be grounds for arresting a person. To restrict the use of forensic procedures to arrested persons would be to build in an important procedural safeguard of the civil liberties of the suspect. In order to arrest a suspect, the constable must have reasonable grounds to believe&mdash;not suspect but believe&mdash;that the person committed the offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill requires the constable to satisfy himself or herself as to a number of matters before he or she can ask a suspect to consent to a forensic procedure. Clearly, the reason for conducting a forensic procedure on a suspect is that the police believe that, by doing so, they will obtain evidence that will assist in their investigations and in securing a conviction. Thus, one of the matters on which the constable must satisfy himself or herself is that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the forensic procedure is likely to produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect committed a relevant offence. But the bill defines `relevant offence' to mean not only the offence in relation to which the person is a suspect but also any other indictable offence in respect of which the evidence likely to be obtained as a result of a proposed forensic procedure carried out on the suspect is likely to have probative value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drafting of this definition is unsatisfactory because its application gives an ambiguous result. For example, in its present form, it would allow the police to conduct a forensic procedure on a person for the purpose of gathering evidence in relation to an offence which the person is not suspected of having committed, in order to prove or disprove that the person committed that offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the present wording of the provision allows a magistrate to order a forensic procedure if he or she is satisfied that it would produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect committed an offence which the person is not suspected of having committed. This is clearly unsatisfactory and I urge the minister to make the appropriate amendments so as to remove the uncertainty that this provision creates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides no right of appeal for a suspect against a magistrate's order allowing a forensic procedure to be carried out. In my view, there ought to be some appeal mechanism in order to ensure that the individual's rights are protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill prescribes the matters as to which the constable must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, before he or she can ask a suspect to consent to a forensic procedure. These matters include considering whether the request is justified in all the circumstances. To decide this, the constable is required to balance the public interest in obtaining evidence against the opposing public interest in upholding the physical integrity of the suspect. In order to conduct this balancing test, the bill requires the constable to have regard to a number of matters set out in the bill. Surprisingly, while the list of matters includes such things as the cultural background of the suspect, the bill does not require that the constable take account of a person's religious beliefs, if relevant, when he determines where the public interest lies. Some forensic procedures, such as the taking of blood, may directly infringe on a person's religious beliefs. In my view, a religious objection to a forensic procedure is a matter that constables should take into account when determining public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that, when deciding whether to ask an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander suspect to consent to a forensic procedure or whether to make a constable's order in the absence of consent, a constable is required to ascertain the customary beliefs of the suspect. It has been pointed out that it is difficult to imagine less favourable circumstances for a constable to discover a person's cultural beliefs than during a criminal investigation into that person and while considering whether to ask or order that person to submit to forensic procedures. It has been suggested that it may be better to express the duty on magistrates and constables as a duty to ask the suspect if there was anything they wished to put before the magistrate or constable in relation to their customary beliefs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before a constable can ask an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander suspect to consent to a forensic procedure, the constable is required to notify a representative of an Aboriginal legal aid organisation, unless the suspect has arranged for a lawyer to be present. This provision fails to recognise the difficulties that arise in some places, including, in particular, my own state, Western Australia. Aboriginal people often live in remote communities where Aboriginal legal aid representatives do not live and where it would take many hours to get the services of such a person. In the meantime, important forensic material may be lost. The need for the inclusion of this requirement is difficult to understand in a case of non-intimate and non-invasive forensic procedures such as taking a photo of a wound. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is noted that the constable must, in addition, inform the suspect of a list of matters set out in the bill. These include the purpose of the forensic procedure, the offence in relation to which the constable wants the procedure carried out, the fact that any evidence might be used as evidence in court against the suspect and the suspect's right to refuse to consent to the procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill not only authorises the police to carry out both intimate and non-intimate forensic procedures in specified circumstances, it also empowers the police to use reasonable force to carry out the procedure. However, the bill does not authorise the police to take a sample of hair by removing the root of the hair, nor to carry out a forensic procedure in a `cruel, inhuman or degrading manner'. In my view, the police should not be authorised to use force to conduct an intimate forensic procedure on a suspect who has not been arrested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor does the bill make it clear who will be conducting the forensic procedure. The table in the bill sets out the different procedures and who may conduct them. In all but two cases, the procedure need not be conducted by a medical practitioner or a nurse, but it may be conducted by an `appropriately qualified person'. An `appropriately qualified person' is defined in the bill as someone qualified as prescribed by regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, forensic scientists are involved in the collection of samples from suspects under state legislation. Any regulations to be made under the bill should include forensic scientists as appropriately qualified persons. But by far the preferable alternative would be for the qualifications to be set out in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The category of persons who can undertake intimate body searches should be strictly limited by the parliament. Some of the forensic procedures, particularly those defined as `intimate procedures', are so intrusive that it is important that the parliament has a say in who is to be authorised to conduct them. In this context, it is not at all appropriate that the meaning of `appropriately qualified person' be left to be fleshed out by regulations as yet unmade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also empowers a person who is authorised to conduct a forensic procedure to ask another person, who need not be qualified, to assist him or her with the procedure. This provision causes me some concern. If there is a need to have assistance in any instance, the choice of a helper should be restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, in all procedures except the taking of a hand, foot, finger or toe print, the suspect is entitled to request the presence of a medical practitioner, and in some cases a dentist, of his or her own choice. However, the bill does not allow the suspect to have the procedure conducted by their own doctor or dentist. To have one's own doctor conduct a specified procedure would make the process much more acceptable. If conducted in this way, but in the presence of the investigating constable, it is difficult to see what objection could be taken by the police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that if there is a breach of or a failure to comply with the procedures in the bill, and the suspect objects to the admissibility of the evidence in court, then the court has a discretion to admit the evidence. In my view, there is a strong argument for rejecting all evidence that is tainted by illegality. Any evidence obtained from a forensic procedure conducted in breach of the provisions of the bill should be required, except for very good reason, to be treated as inadmissible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the bill is designed to ensure a balance between the two aims of prosecuting offenders and protecting the civil liberties of the individual, then a failure to observe any of those very detailed provisions unbalances the scales and can lead to an injustice. This parliament should be vigilant to avoid that possibility and I urge the minister to amend the bill accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also permits the taking of blood samples after a person has been convicted of a serious offence and a court has directed that the person give a blood sample. In deciding whether to make the order, the court must take into account the seriousness of the circumstances surrounding the offence, the gravity of the offence and whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person may have committed some other serious offence or may commit some other serious offence in the future. In this respect, this bill makes unreasonable demands on the courts. While the court may conceivably have grounds for believing that the person may have committed some other serious offence, the court cannot really decide that a person may commit some other serious offence in the future. Due to the unpredictability of human nature, the courts are not equipped to judge which convicted criminals will re-offend and which will be rehabilitated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that a constable who is investigating an offence can order that a forensic procedure be carried out on a suspect without consent, it is arguable that the bill should include a reporting requirement on the exercise of the power. An annual report should set out the number of applications for orders for forensic procedures, the number of orders made and an assessment of how the procedure is working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that the widening of police powers to take body samples would create a situation in which the police become more careless with the proper traditional methods of investigation. It is said that there is the potential for abuse. For example, a lazy or corrupt investigator may be tempted to put a hair from a suspect at the scene of a crime in order to secure a conviction. It is difficult to assess that risk, but any reporting mechanism should enable some assessment to be made after some experience of the use of the powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill exempts from civil and criminal liability any person who carries out or helps to carry out a forensic procedure in the circumstances set out in the relevant clause of the bill. These circumstances are generally that the person acted in good faith and believed, on reasonable grounds, either that the suspect had given informed consent or that a court order had been made. In this respect, that person will be often entirely acting in reliance upon a police constable who may have made the order. In my view, this exclusion from liability is very wide. It gives the individual insufficient protection against unjustified testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, it is questionable that such a range of forensic procedures need be authorised. A blood sample can provide the best DNA evidence, as well as blood type and other markers. The results of blood tests can be cross-matched with other body fluids at the scene of a crime. It is not clear to me why, if parliament gives police compulsory power to obtain blood samples, they should also be authorised to take saliva or hair. There is no limit on the range which may be applied to an individual and, no doubt, police will seek to use the range in each case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person may be arrested for the purpose of being brought before the court for an application by the police for a forensic search order. There is, in the original form of the bill, no time limit on this period of detention. I understand from the second reaching speech delivered by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) that there will be a limit. It is unclear if state bail legislation will apply to a person detained under this provision. The only remedy available where a detained person has not been arrested appears to be the common law action of habeas corpus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These concerns reflect community concerns with the provisions of the bill and amply justify the Senate inquiry, and also amply justified an inquiry which was not conducted by the House committee, and I commend the amendment to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate that has taken place in the Main Committee in relation to the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 1995 amply indicates that the minister has, in my view, improperly rushed into this place to force the House of Representatives to have a debate on a bill precipitately, particularly when there are obviously very widespread concerns throughout the Australian community in relation to both the substance and the detail of this particular bill. We understand that the minister at one stage was happy to defer this debate until after the Senate Legal and Constitution Affairs Legislation Committee had in fact reported, but apparently the report of the Senate committee has been postponed somewhat and the result is that the minister now wishes the debate which is currently taking place to in fact occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate, because it is obvious, given the very great interest from the Australian community in the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 1995, that the Senate committee will make a number of recommendations for change. Clearly, the law needs to take advantage of technological advances. It is important to always get a balance between the rights of the subject and, indeed, the community's need to ensure that people who have committed offences are in fact convicted of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular bill is one which we have discussed widely in the coalition. We have spoken to a large number of groups in the community and while, on balance, we are not opposed to the principle of the bill, we do have very grave concern about some elements of the detail. When one looks at the various submissions&mdash;and there have been at least 20 submissions made to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee&mdash;it is obvious that very widespread and well-respected people right across the nation have expressed their concern about one or other element of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that the minister has chosen to treat the House of Representatives with contempt by forcing the House of Representatives to debate this bill when it is obvious that the Senate will be looking very closely at the government's response to the report which will be handed down on 26 October 1995 by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. Clearly, the Senate will hand down its report, and the government will consider the elements of that report and will come back with a response. It is not unreasonable to expect that the minister will accept a considerable number of the recommendations of the Senate committee, particularly if those recommendations are made unanimously or by an overwhelming majority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, the debate we are having in the Main Committee today could be futile because, while we could canvass many of the submissions made before the Senate committee, the reality is that the bill that is ultimately carried by the parliament might well be quite different from the bill which is currently before us for debate. Therefore, I think the minister's actions in precipitating this early debate are unwise, to say the least, and treat the House of Representatives with contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) mentioned another matter and that was that the bill could well have been referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, a committee of which I have the privilege to be a member. This committee has absolutely no work at the moment. It is a committee that is controlled by the government, is chaired by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and has a very large number of members with great experience in the legal and constitutional field but, sadly, for some reason the government appears to be unwilling to refer any legislation to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government seeks to make mileage out of emphasising the importance of the House of Representatives as the people's house and as the house where governments are made and broken. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) refers to senators as `unrepresentative swill' and yet we find that the minister is preferring to have these bills sent to the Senate committee rather than to a committee of the House of Representatives. It is probably an indictment that, since Federation, House of Representatives committees have not worked as well as Senate committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister now has a committee which has produced a number of very effective reports, including one relating to the child sex tourism legislation, yet the minister is not prepared to allow the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to express a view on the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now find that we are debating the legislation. This debate, to a certain extent, will be superseded by the report of the Senate committee and by the debate in the Senate. Ultimately, if this legislation is passed in some form by the other place, the minister will come back and undoubtedly accept the amendments. The minister has put the cart before the horse in putting this particular legislation before the committee at this time. It is obvious, when one is dealing with such important legislation, that both houses of the parliament should be allowed to have a full debate on the terms of the bill which is likely to become law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia at the moment there is a concern about having a balance between police powers and the rights of the individual and this is a bill which significantly increases police powers. Many people are happy with the format of the bill. Some people are happy with the substance of the bill, some people are opposed to it and some people, while supporting the thrust of the bill, are concerned about the detail. The more than 20 submissions which have been received by the Senate committee weigh quite a lot and they will obviously be weighing on the mind of the Senate committee. Those 20 submissions put forward a number of very important points which the minister ought to be considering before seeking to push the bill through the Main Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This important piece of legislation seeks to amend the Crimes Act to enable police to take body samples, such as fingerprints and blood, from suspects in criminal cases. All of us want to see as much uniformity in the criminal law as possible. We are aiming to establish a model criminal code, and it is hoped that the provisions of this bill will be incorporated as part of a national criminal code so that people in one part of the country will be bound by criminal laws similar to those in other parts of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is another reason the government should have looked very closely at its provisions before forcing the House of Representatives Main Committee to discuss them at this time. Across the nation we have differing rules relating to forensic procedures, and it is appropriate that we should endeavour to draw all of these together and find some common ground. I think the minister's precipitate action will probably prevent the uniform approach that we all seek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the parliament is based on the model provisions developed by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The model provisions were the subject of consultation across Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill deals with, firstly, intimate forensic procedures and, secondly, non-intimate forensic procedures. Intimate forensic procedures include the taking of blood, the taking of dental impressions, and procedures involving genital areas and, in the case of women, breasts. Non-intimate procedures include the taking of fingerprints, the taking of samples of non-pubic hair and other less intrusive procedures not involving genital areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme of the bill is to impose greater controls over the taking of intimate forensic procedures.

There have been a number of submissions made concerning those particular matters. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This society has many concerns regarding the proposed legislation which will permit citizens to be subjected to procedures which are invasive, offensive and in many cases intimidatory. This may occur when the citizens concerned have not been charged with any offence and where there is insufficient evidence available to warrant any charge or to sustain any prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA>The Queensland Law Society then went on with a very detailed submission which, again, will be taken into consideration by the Senate committee. But, in this place, we are not able to look at the Senate response to these submissions received by the committee from the Queensland Law Society and by the other people who have seen fit to make submissions to that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Society of New South Wales was quite concerned about the bill and, indeed, there was a letter written to the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee by the president of that society, a person known as Mr Maurie Stack. He said that the Law Society of New South Wales has a number of very great concerns in relation to this bill. He pointed out that the society opposes the taking of samples from persons who have not been arrested. He pointed out that the society opposes the breadth of procedures proposed to be authorised by the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also calls for at least equal, if not greater, protections for persons subject to forensic procedures than exist for persons detained for questioning. It calls for the inclusion of a requirement that a judge warn the jury about any evidence which was collected in breach of the bill. It seeks either the removal of any possible adverse inference or direction or the restriction of any such comments to situations where no sample was obtained. It submits that evidence of resistance should be inadmissible or, alternatively, restricted to situations where no sample was obtained and it seeks the inclusion in the bill of a requirement that police officers and magistrates must warn the detainee of the consequences of resistance. It opposes the removal of the current requirement that the fingerprints of juveniles charged with an offence may be taken only as a result of a court order. It calls for the substitution of supplier to be made available to remove any ambiguity about the right of the detained person to obtain copies or samples of evidence. That is from section 23YG. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, whichever way you look at it, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a complicated bill. It is an important bill. It is a bill which seeks to take advantage of advances in technology. On the other hand, it is a piece of legislation about which very many people have expressed great concern. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, on 14 February 1995, quite accurately expressed the debate which was taking place. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parliamentary debate is already shaping along established lines between the civil libertarians, who argue that taking samples from a suspect is a potential infringement of privacy and individual rights, and those who argue that police need such tools to carry out their investigations properly.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Justice, Duncan Kerr, says the planned federal law has a built-in safeguard; police must apply for a court order to take samples from suspects who do not give their consent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`What is required is a balance between the civil liberties of the individual and the requirement for police to have adequate investigative powers,' Kerr said when he announced the bill.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have a situation where people on this side of the House and on the other side of House agree that we need to have a balance. Of course, our responsibility is to get that balance right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, by forcing the debate at this time, has deprived this House of the opportunity of getting that balance right. We could debate this particular bill all day. We could argue along the lines of the 20-odd submissions made to the Senate committee, but what really ought to happen is that the government should take this bill away. The government ought not to deal with this bill until such time as the Senate committee has reported, until such time as the Attorney-General's Department and the minister have had the opportunity to absorb the contents of that Senate report. Then it should release a response to that particular report for public viewing. Unfortunately, the government has decided to proceed, notwithstanding the fact that the Senate committee has not reported. The Senate committee will report in December, which is not very far away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has been around for a long time. Another two months delay is not going to be a major problem. What the government should do, in my view, is to wait. It should accept the suggestion of the opposition that the legislation not be proceeded with until after the committee has reported and the government has responded to the committee. Once that has happened, we will then see amendments to the bill and this House will be able to debate the amended bill, which would be along the lines of a bill more likely to be carried by both houses of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that the minister has failed to take the advice that we have given him. The result will be that he has deprived the House of Representatives of the opportunity of debating in full a bill which will ultimately become law. I think the minister, as a minister of the Crown in a government which purports to push the rights of the House of Representatives, has once again been exposed as being a hypocritical person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see the honourable member for Banks come into the chamber, because he is the chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I invite him before the Committee this morning to tell the Committee and to tell the minister in this public forum that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs would have been more than happy to receive the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 1995. </PARA>

The fact of the matter is that we have a good committee, we have an effective committee, we have a committee that is widely representative&mdash;a committee that the government controls&mdash;and yet, despite that, the minister is not prepared to give that committee any work at all. The committee in the Senate is burdened down with work and that has delayed the handing down of the Senate report. What the minister could have done would have been to refer this bill to the House committee. Because he has not given us any work in recent times, the committee could have processed the bill quickly. He could have had our advice, he could have had our suggested amendments and, indeed, he then could have amended the bill and we could have had a full debate here on what would be the final form of the bill. Instead, what is going to happen is that this debate will proceed to the other place, there will be very many amendments made to the bill and the bill will return to the House of Representatives ultimately. The minister will accept many of those amendments and they will be pumped through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the minister, by refusing to refer this bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, has deprived this House, the people's house, the house of which he is supposed to be the champion, of the opportunity to debate the actual form of legislation which most probably will become the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Act 1995 after it has been through both houses of the parliament. I invite the member for Banks now to rise in this place and to tell us whether our committee could have handled this matter and whether he approves of what the minister has done. I think that what the minister has done is most unfortunate and is most derogatory to the position of the House of Representatives in this Australian parliament. </PARA>

<PARA>The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 is part of a global network of legislation, with the goal of protecting biological diversity and maintaining ecological processes and systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments will enhance the extent to which Australia discharges its obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of wild fauna and flora and the Convention on Biological Diversity. The amendments will provide an improved administrative framework, strengthen measures against illegal wildlife trafficking, and make the Australian Nature Conservation Agency's service to client groups more effective. They will also support a national approach to the conservation of Australia's biodiversity and improve arrangements for regulating the commercial use of wildlife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments have been developed after extensive consultations with state and territory governments, and industry and non-government organisations, and are in accord with the intergovernmental agreement on the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes have largely arisen from recommendations of the Ley report which reviewed the act, having particular regard to Australia's obligations under CITES. The proposed amendments will implement appendix III of CITES, relating to species identified by a party as under regulation to prevent or restrict exploitation, and needing the cooperation of others in the control of trade. They will also enable a more flexible approach to controlling private non-commercial trade in species identified under appendix II of CITES, species identified as, although not endangered, requiring trade regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of wildlife export industries in Australia are subject to the act, which currently provides for the establishment of management and controlled specimens programs, the development of which is undertaken in close consultation with state and territory agencies. The amendments will include the requirement that any proposals for the commercial utilisation and international trade in native wildlife are subject to appropriate legislative and regulatory regimes in the relevant state or territory. Management programs may only be approved where the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories is satisfied that to ensure protection of the species, appropriate regulatory measures, monitoring and assessment procedures are in place for the proposed harvesting activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Management programs will be subject to time limitations, as it is vital that harvesting of wild native plants and animals is reviewed on a regular basis. Therefore, the amendments will establish a maximum period of five years between such reviews, with the flexibility to establish shorter periods should it be considered necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the introduction of special conditions for permits for export of native animals under inter-zoological garden transfer, Australian zoos will be better able to manage their animal populations. The well-developed Australasian species management program will be assisted by these measures, which will also facilitate participation in international breeding programs involving endangered species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The risks of detection and prosecution to those associated with wildlife smuggling will increase as a combined result of improved administrative measures and enforcement efforts. Continuation of cooperative work undertaken by the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, the Australian Customs Service, state and federal police, and state wildlife agencies will ensure that these changes are effective. Overall, they will improve operating efficiency without compromising the protection of wildlife and the Australian environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals include improved enforcement powers of inspectors appointed under the act by strengthening powers of seizure, improving powers of search of premises and conveyances and providing powers to conduct frisk searches of suspect persons, enabling seizure of specimens. These provisions are consistent with the Criminal Code Bill 1994 and the recently amended Crimes Act 1914, while taking into account the rights of the individual. Penalties have also been made consistent with Commonwealth policy regarding introduction of penalty units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the substantial penalties currently available for illegally importing and exporting wildlife, the amendments propose a new offence. Any person illegally importing or exporting live animals may be subject to a potential two-year imprisonment term, if found guilty of cruel treatment to the animal. This will ensure that the treatment of the animals involved in such crimes is subject to consideration by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also concerned that the establishment of self-sustaining populations of exotic birds in the Australian wild could have disastrous effects on native wildlife populations. Further, it may only take one bird which is infected with an exotic disease, and which has been smuggled into Australia, to contaminate thousands of aviary held or wild native birds. These are serious risks which require a comprehensive approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central measure in the bill, to address these concerns, is the introduction of a national exotic bird registration scheme. The scheme was developed in close consultation with the aviculture industry, bird keepers and the states and territories. Registration will provide an inventory of exotic birds currently housed in Australia that have environmental or pest potential, and those that are endangered internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A national inventory created under the scheme will provide an agreed list of exotic birds in Australia that will enable, for the first time, the means to properly manage exotic birds. Whilst providing a national focus, the proposed amendments allow the states and territories the flexibility to impose additional measures if they so desire. The scheme will support and assist the legal trade in exotic birds within Australia. The uncertainty and risks associated with the purchase of many birds will be substantially reduced, by eliminating doubt as to the legal origin of the bird. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An advisory committee to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories will be established to examine the ongoing effectiveness of the registration scheme and to provide advice on proposed variations to the list of birds proposed for registration. This committee will comprise representatives of government, conservation, and private and professional aviculture. As agreed to in the Senate, the amendment bill will ensure that any one interest group does not constitute a majority of the members of the Exotic Birds Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, two other changes were made to the amendment bill in the Senate. The first referred to the requirement for the Australian Nature Conservation Agency to provide reports on permits and authorities issued to be produced at least every 12 months, and the second removed from the amendment bill those sections which would allow the import of appendix 1 specimens subject to CITES quota, such as leopard skins.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to address the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1995 as the subject of the bill is a particular interest of mine. As the bill has already gone through the Senate and the actual details of the bill have been addressed by the shadow minister for the environment, Senator Rod Kemp, I shall not go into these details. I will address the bill in a wider, general context and I will discuss some of the principles behind the bill where the government is failing. There is a lot more which should be done in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is in a unique position inasmuch as it is a single country continent and has unique flora and fauna. Australia's unique flora and fauna have evolved in a particular ecological system which does not&mdash;except, obviously, for things like migratory birds and fishes which have become part of this ecological system&mdash;allow for too much interruption. When we bring exotic species into Australia, we do so at considerable threat to this environment. This bill seeks in part to address this situation, but it does not go far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill looks at the importation and exportation of both endangered species and other species. When I read the list of the species that we are allowed to import, I was delighted to find that one of the species is a fowl known as Gallus gallus. It is this very importation of birds that I address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia imported exotic birds&mdash;I am talking about birds such as parrots which were imported for aviarians&mdash;until the 1950s but stopped importation because of the possible danger to the Australian bird population. Australia did not begin importing exotic birds again until 1989 when the regulations changed. The regulations were changed because of pressure from aviculturists. The aviculturists had a genetic stock which was becoming inbred and they wanted to bring in aviary birds from overseas to add to their stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The desire of aviculturists to bring in new stock is a legitimate desire but it is one that does not warrant the risk that is taken in doing so. This is because when permission was granted for these exotic birds to be brought in we simply did not have the knowledge about exotic parrot and budgerigar diseases that we have, for instance, about the diseases that affect poultry. A lot of money has gone into researching the sorts of diseases&mdash;such as Newcastle disease&mdash;which affect poultry, simply because of the commercial impact such diseases would have on our poultry industry. However, this research has never been carried out with parrot diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, after 1989 when we lifted the ban on the importation of these exotic species, when the first shipments of budgerigars were brought in many deaths occurred amongst the budgerigar population. The budgerigars were given antibiotics but, as with antibiotics in other situations, the budgerigars overseas were becoming immune to the antibiotics. Consequently, when the budgerigars were brought into Australia, Australian budgerigars picked up the same viruses and the Australian birds are now also becoming resistant to antibiotics. This situation is having quite an effect on Australia's budgerigar population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now a range of diseases in Australia's budgerigar population which has never been seen before. Polyama virus is one of the diseases which we simply did not see in Australia before the shipments of budgerigars arrived after 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But of even greater concern is what is happening with the parrot population. In 1992 we had the first shipment of parrots after the change of regulations in 1989. The requirements of these shipment are that the parrots remain in quarantine in England until they are shipped out here; they then go into quarantine in Australia. In 1993 a further shipment was made. While these parrots were in quarantine in England, a green-winged macaw died, as did a lutino elegance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this, the whole shipload was brought to Australia, where a second green-winged macaw became ill. It was dosed up with antibiotics and then released to the person who had ordered it, who happened to be a very reputable aviarist from Grafton; it was fortunate that it was somebody of such high repute. But the bird died seven weeks later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some mystery as to what happened when that bird died. There have been accusations that there were insufficient investigations. There was no request for the isolation of the other birds that were in the cage with the green-winged macaw. This has caused concern amongst people who believe that it was at best premature, and at worst foolhardy, to begin importing exotic birds into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the arguments that was given for doing this&mdash;and it does sound like a fairly convincing argument&mdash;is that prior to their importation there was quite a big trade in illegal birds. Birds were carried in jackets, with the eggs in the pockets. The aviarists put to the government that if the birds were allowed in legally this would cut down the illegal trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first objection to that argument is that, when you have birds such as the green-winged macaw that are selling for $20,000 a pair, you are not going to cut down the illegal trade. There is too much money to be made out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, rather than cutting it down, this provided an opportunity for the laundering of illegal birds. As long as new birds were coming in, they could be passed off as part of the progeny of that new bird shipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons for the introduction of these regulations is to deal with that problem. To prevent the laundering of the illegal birds, there is a much stricter registration scheme on exotic birds that are brought in legally . However, I suspect that this is far from foolproof. Even if it has, and does, cut down the illegal importation of birds to a certain extent, it does not remove the risks that importation poses to Australia's native bird population. I certainly do not want to be taken as saying anything in favour of smugglers, but eggs are much less likely to be carriers of disease than the birds themselves. Our native bird population is at less risk from smugglers than from the legal activities of bird importers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These birds are kept in aviaries, and we only need one infected bird to come in and infect other birds in that aviary. Some of these birds are the Typhoid Marys of the bird population: they carry diseases which they themselves do not show any signs of, but they carry it to others. An example of this is the South American conures, which carry Pacheo diseases. They do not show the effects themselves; they simply pass it to other birds. Australian parrots are very susceptible to South American diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exotic birds can bring in other diseases. The Rio virus is brought in by the South African grey parrots. While we already have pox virus in Australia, it is a different strain from that which is coming in with the exotic birds. Our birds are very susceptible to that strain. I do not want to say that we are infecting our bird population at this stage, because we are not, but the danger does exist. While we continue to bring exotic birds into Australia simply so that aviarists can increase their genetic stock we are putting our wildlife population at risk. We only need one bird to infect other birds in an aviary and then one of those infected birds to get out into the wild population or an aviarist who is not as careful as some to take a dead bird out of his aviary and throw it on a rubbish heap; that would be enough for a disease to get out and infect the bird population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is of considerable concern to me. Although I am happy to see that we are tightening up on the registration of exotic birds, I still think the basic problem remains. I am yet to be convinced that the risk we are taking with our bird population is worth it, simply so the aviarists can have a wider stock in their aviaries. I cannot see where the risk benefit is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people really want to do this, I urge the government to look at zoo breeding. Zoos can bring in eggs under strictly controlled conditions. They can then breed them and sell them as a money making enterprise to the aviarists who want a wider stock of birds. This would seem to me to solve both problems. It would allow aviarists to have their birds and it would guarantee the safety of our bird population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I support what the bill is doing in regard to birds, I would like us to have a moratorium on the importation of exotic birds to see whether we can do it some other way without putting our bird life at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the bill was mooted, the World Wide Fund for Nature suggested that some amendments should be made to it, and I support them. I note those amendments have not been put in. They were amendments of a fairly minor nature. We will not be putting the amendments today, but I hope that at some later stage either the present government or a coalition government would have a look at them. Their concern is about the use of the CITES species, the endangered species, in herbal medicines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These medicines are based on the mythological characteristics of some animals. Leopards, tigers and deer musk are used and seem to have magical properties. Tiger penis is also supposed to be fairly good for something. I am sure the gentlemen here would know much more about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is quite a trade in these medicines, especially amongst people whose families originally came from Asia. While there is prohibition against use and a penalty for possession, the penalty is exactly the same if a person has them in their possession for sale. Part of the World Wide Fund for Nature, the Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce, has pointed out that we need a larger penalty for people who are importing these parts of endangered species and selling them as medicines. To have an elderly gentleman who is using deer musk in his house receive the same penalty as a person who has imported and is selling medicines does not make any sense at all. There should be a much greater penalty for sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At some stage I would like to see the government or the succeeding coalition government introduce those amendments and add them to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on the same principle as I espoused earlier, we are allowing far too much into this country&mdash;not only birds but also aquarium fish and fish bait. Recently there was a suggestion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners </EMPHASIS>program that the death of pilchards around Australia might have been caused by the importation of frozen pilchard bait for the tuna fish industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tuna industry denied this and said that it was not possible as the bait had been tested. I would be inclined to believe the people in the tuna industry because they take their industry very seriously. But the point is that something did get in and infect that fish. While ever we import frozen bait&mdash;because we cannot supply it ourselves&mdash;and other types of fish, we will be putting our fish and our waterways at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every day when I leaf through the papers I find headlines such as `Carp puts trout fishery in danger', `Exotic fish threat to Lake Eucumbene', `Fish pose threat to Queensland water supplies'&mdash;that is the exotic tropical fish tilapia&mdash;and so on. We are standing on the edge of a potential catastrophe by allowing these imports to get into our rivers. We saw what happened in the Murray with the carp. Our rivers are simply not set up to include these exotic fish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only with marine and animal life that we have a problem; we also have a problem with introduced plants, especially grasses. This issue was brought to my attention when I went around Australia with the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. Many of the weeds that now infest our countryside were brought in as grasses to be used in agriculture, to bind banks and other things. These grasses have now got out of control and are taking over some of our native grasslands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. What is really disturbing is that it is still happening and we do not have the controls that we should have on the importation of a lot of these seeds and grasses. There was an article by Julian Cribb on imported plants in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 21 February 1994. I found that article absolutely fascinating because it provided statistics on what has been happening. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a scientific study showing many supposedly useful plants allowed into Australia in the past 40 years have proved to be devastating weeds.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of 463 alien plants introduced to northern Australia since 1947, only 21 proved useful&mdash;but 60 became weeds. Of the useful plants, 17 later became weeds also, according to the research by CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the country's 220 worst exotic weeds, almost half had been introduce for a purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>That we continue to allow these grasses and plants into Australia is, I think, extraordinarily dangerous and extraordinarily foolhardy. This should be looked at by whichever party is in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environment committee recommended in its report on biological diversity that this should happen, and I cannot remember the name of the report. We made a strong recommendation that there be much stricter controls on grasses and plants brought into Australia for agricultural purposes. The information that I have been given is that that is not happening and that there is certainly a very strong lack of good controls. As I said at the beginning, we are so vulnerable in this area because of the way that our environment has evolved with its own ecosystem which simply cannot tolerate invasions of exotic species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the bill, and especially the establishment of the Exotic Birds Committee and the exotic bird registration scheme. I support the aim of the registration scheme to make it extremely difficult to trade in illegal birds. I would not accept the `extremely difficult.' It might make it more difficult but that does not remove the problem that exotic birds pose when they are legally imported. We will certainly support the main thrust of the bill, which is to protect endangered species&mdash;our own endangered species and those of other countries&mdash;from being imported into this country and to stop a trade which is absolutely despicable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good to see bipartisan support for the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1995. It is very important.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a bit concerned about the Gallus gallus chook. I did not know whether this was the one that strutted around and crowed, and did not lay eggs. All I have been used to in my career is black australorps and white leghorns. I have never come across a Gallus gallus but I will look that up!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation strengthens some of the penalties. It creates new bodies to control imports and export of wildlife and, on the whole, it strengthens up a very good bit of legislation that we have had. One aspect of that strengthening is that the importing of endangered plants and animals from other countries, contrary to the foreign laws of those countries, will be punishable by five years gaol and a fine of up to $30,000. We are saying that if anyone abuses another country's laws we can actually prosecute them here, which is good. This should be done, as a method of tightening up and making certain that this trade in wildlife, both fauna and flora, is stopped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will also make it possible to prosecute smugglers for cruelty. In a way, this reflects the outrage that has come from the general public when they see photographs of animals that have been kept in video cassette or tape boxes. Lizards have been smuggled in those sorts of things, birds have been drugged and put into coat pockets, and various snakes, lizards and things like that have been frozen and put into suitcases. People have then tried to transport them overseas and have been caught out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting variations on this is the fact that when, just recently, some smugglers were caught with bird eggs, one was actually caught egg in mouth. The idea of that, I suppose, was to keep the egg warm all the time and so when the egg got to the destination, wherever it was, it would have been warm all the way through. There have been some quite inventive ways of smuggling various wildlife and plants, and I will bring them up as I go through my speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will also give officers powers to seize hunting trophies from travellers entering Australia. I do not know whether elephants are an endangered species, but overseas I have actually seen elephants' legs being used as stands to keep umbrellas in, and that sort of thing. Trophies and things like that will be stopped from being brought into the country, and I think that is good. As the previous speaker said about the importation of birds, we should stop the importation of all birds and all animals, except for zoos. They should be given an exemption where the correct customs and quarantine regulations are in force but otherwise we should stop the importation of all animals to this country, because we do not know what sort of disease they will bring in and how quickly it can spread. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has only to look at what has happened in recent days with the spread of the rabbit disease from an island in South Australia. According to the CSIRO it was going to be quite safe&mdash;it would not get across. They do not know how it has made its way across to the mainland. It could be by flies or mosquitoes. I know that it will please a lot of farmers and I too am pleased that the rabbit population will be wiped out, but we were not sure&mdash;and we still are not sure&mdash;of the effect it will have on other wildlife. Rabbits are similar to some of Australia's smaller creatures in size, so we do not really know the effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing the disease will do is to wipe out a lot of foxes and feral cats. That is good because they will not be able to feed on the rabbits, but those foxes and feral cats will get a bit hungry in the meantime and proceed to get stuck into our Australian wildlife instead of eating rabbits. So there are spin-offs from that release into our wildlife which give a good example of how a virus, or some sort of insect, can be transmitted very quickly throughout the whole of this island nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to laws that are put up by worldwide bodies in connection with smuggling, it is interesting to have a look at some of the world figures on smuggling of wildlife. Last year, there were at least five million birds, 25,000 primates and 10 million reptiles illegally taken from their homes in the wild. This is according to an organisation called TRAFFIC&mdash;Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce. That is, flora and fauna are being taken from their homes in the bush&mdash;they are stolen. Some are put into good homes as pets, but a lot of them get killed or get transferred to other countries where they can cause lots of problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only animals that get stolen and illegally traded, but also plants&mdash;and they are very big business. It has been estimated, for example, that 9.3 million orchids, 7.5 million cacti and countless other twigs and flowering species are sold each year on the international market. Profits from this trade can be vast. Again, there are no true figures, but the estimates are that this sort of trafficking in flora and fauna and its sale is worth $27 billion per year. That is a huge amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In January 1994, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> gave some interesting statistics in relation to people in Australia who have been charged with smuggling wildlife. The article said that there had been a total of 119 offences since the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act came into effect in 1984. So there have not been many people since 1984, but I think that is just the tip of the iceberg. There is a lot of this going on and a lot of people getting away with it. But prosecutions have started, they have seized quite a lot of exports, and I think the bill will improve the lot of the Customs officers and, therefore, they will be able to bring more prosecutions. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs officers have seized 207 Australian birds, 251 parrot eggs and 498 reptiles, as well as a large quantity of incoming exotic wildlife. About two to three times as many Australian animals have been seized by officials at Customs barriers overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>So we are missing out on a whole of this and it is being caught up overseas, but still there is a lot of it going on. Our parrots and other bird life are in demand overseas and our lizards and other reptiles are also in demand. Many of them are being sold and people are making vast profits out of the trade. Somehow or other, we have to stop it. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The worldwide illicit traffic in wildlife is estimated at $2.5 billion annually. The value of Australian wildlife seized in relation to prosecutions since 1984 is between $10 million and $15 million&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, those 207 Australian birds, 251 parrots and 498 reptiles add up to around $10 million to $15 million. You can see why it is a very lucrative trade for smugglers and crooks to be in, plus they are fairly hard to catch&mdash;or they have been in the past. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> article, as I said, was from January 1994, and it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the bird-breeding season in tropical Queensland is now in full swing but there are no wildlife rangers employed north of Cairns to enforce anti-trafficking laws.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a year ago and I do not know whether the situation is still the same. But there are a lot of islands between here and Papua New Guinea, and there is a big lot of air traffic going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) is aware of some of the things that happen up in North Queensland. I can recall being up there years ago and hearing all these strange aeroplane flights. Who knows where they were going!

And there is no-one up there to watch it, no-one up there to actually catch anyone who is doing this poaching of these birds and animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People use some intriguing and interesting methods: they drug the birds and animals and they freeze the skinks.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While cylinders in suitcases are the most common smuggling method, couriers employ other, sometimes quite bizarre, means. One woman had a monkey in a bra she was wearing; another had parrot eggs tucked under her breasts.</PARA>
<PARA>That was to keep them warm. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A man had a shingleback lizard in his underpants; another had carp fish in plastic bags in his coat pockets. One smuggler had tarantula spiders hidden in a thermos flask. Parrot eggs have been found strapped to bodies and even inside the mouth of one courier.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, a courier had birds' eggs in his mouth to keep them warm. Why would you do this? I suppose the profits are worth while. Some of the positions that these animals find themselves in would certainly be interesting! Giving another example of wildlife pets, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in just four months recently, 8000 green tree-frogs were collected in the Mackay region in Central Queensland for sale to southern dealers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, they are sold to dealers in New South Wales and Victoria. People want to keep green tree frogs: they are a nice looking animal, they make nice noises and they eat the insects. However, we should be stopping this transference of wildlife to people in the southern states. If people want to have green tree frogs, maybe they can start breeding them.

He says that wildlife smugglers are really the wrong people to be attacking, and that we should get to the other area. Dr Cogger is quite interesting, and I believe he has got a point here. He is the Deputy Director of the Australian Museum, and he notes that Australia's animal export laws are so strict that, technically, travellers need a permit to take their skin bacteria with them when they go overseas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Cogger says that, despite fierce protection and eight active state and federal agencies with investigatory and enforcement roles, legal or illegal trading in native animals is really of minor significance to the survival of most of the species of native fauna. Making an educated guess based on known population densities of the various species of `herps', Dr Cogger reckons that Australia boasts a standing stock of about 192 billion individual reptiles and amphibians of all kinds and that, in any one year, about 39 billion of the total stock will die of natural causes; feral cats will kill another 240 million; land clearing, another 100 million; road-kills, five million; research collectors, 20,000; and public and private collectors, 8,000. The whole of the legal export trade may account for a few thousand animals and, while the impact could be significant for a few very rare species, it is trivial for most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Cogger is saying that the majority of the losses of all our animals are not through smuggling and theft but through normal processes&mdash;plus, as I said, clearing of land, road-kills, et cetera. Maybe that is what we have got to actually have a good look at. Maybe we have got to take into account not just the protection of our wildlife from smugglers but also the protection of our wildlife from us. Maybe we should be looking a lot more closely at the way we clear land, cut down our forests and allow feral cats and rabbits and foxes to run loose. If we put more effort into getting rid of those problems, we will save a lot more wild animals than we are saving through attacking those people who are making a profit out of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention wildlife problems. Mention was made before of the death of the pilchards recently. No-one knows how this occurred. There has been a belief that it actually came through a disease that was brought into South Australia and that then slowly spread from there around the coast. Recently, I was with the Minister for Tourism, Mr Lee, down at Phillip Island, looking at the penguin parade there. I took him down to have a look because he had never seen the biggest tourist attraction in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, the penguin numbers are quite good. About 700 are coming up of a night, and they feed on pilchards. Even though millions of pilchards have been killed, there are still millions there and the penguins are surviving quite well. But the problem is that, if there were any great loss in that pilchard area because of another outbreak of disease that kills off more pilchards, the penguin parade&mdash;which, as a tourist attraction, is something that is estimated to bring over $100 million into Victoria and $300 million into Australia every year&mdash;would be gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that could affect our wildlife down on Phillip Island in Westernport Bay, where we have these Ramsar agreements looking after migratory birds&mdash;more wildlife&mdash;is the fact that Shell and Mobil want to bring huge supertankers into the bay. Sooner or later, one of those supertankers is going to have an accident, and you only have to look at what happened recently in Tasmania to see the devastation that that would cause to our wildlife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be looking at all facets of how our wildlife can be attacked, since we can lose our wildlife not just through smuggling but also through other human action. It is important that the government look closely at that aspect. With the figures that I gave before of the millions of animals being killed by various human encroachments on their land, we should look at the problem even more closely than we are now doing, and not just at what is happening in relation to the smuggling and theft of our wildlife. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am looking forward to making some remarks on the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1995, the aim of which is to improve the import and export control mechanisms for wildlife and which is consistent with the CITES agreement, which we ratified in this country in 1976, and the International Convention of Biological Diversity, which we ratified in 1993. It is worth nothing that the principal act was introduced by the coalition in 1982 and received the support of all parties then, as do these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened with interest to some of the debate today and I do not object to any of the changes in these regulations and the increased controls, and increased penalties where appropriate. In fact, I happen to believe that the penalties for breaking these sorts of laws ought to be quite stultifying. I think what has happened a lot of the time is that penalties creep as time goes on, but the rewards creep higher for smuggling, so therefore the penalties really are taken in as part of the calculation in the business of smuggling. But these bills give us all an opportunity to perhaps put up some other ideas. Whilst we agree in general with these things, there are a couple of things that I would like to raise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the states have been widely consulted and, whilst there is some disagreement in some areas, there is general agreement to the measures. I was interested the other day to be talking to several of the senior environment ministers in the states who were in agreement that, really, one of the things we have to do is to increase the commercialisation of Australian native wildlife. And I want to give what could perhaps be an example of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a dog fence, as everybody knows, which starts somewhere down at the Great Australian Bight. I have seen the end of it. As the fellow who showed it to me 30 years ago said, `If you cut that big wire that holds it there, she falls down all the way to Queensland.' But the fact of the matter is that it is some 1,600 miles long and, effectively, that was done to put the wild dog on the outside and the sheep on the inside. Inside that fence a great watering system sprang up over time to water the sheep, obviously, and the cattle, to some extent. And the by-product of all of that is that we have probably created the biggest single or double species&mdash;kangaroo and emu&mdash;wildlife park in the world. Nobody has ever, I suggest, immunised a species from its natural enemies and then made sure that it did not perish in the droughts which are so common in this country, and which certainly were before we produced these watering systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to extrapolate that a bit, other people, of course, have tried of recent times to breed animals by removing their natural predators&mdash;or their unnatural predators, in the case of the fox and the cat mentioned by the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) and other people. It seems to me that whilst we have controls, penalties, regulations, punishments, and all sorts of people trying to make sure those regulations and controls are abided by, on the other hand we have the problem of our rarer species&mdash;and that is where, to some extent, I disagree with some of those who say we do not have a problem because of the numbers that are traded as opposed to the numbers that are still here&mdash;or the ones that we make rare for other people in other parts of the world that have the very high values. That makes the smuggling business worth the candle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said here today, that occurs in reptiles, birds and fish. And just to add to the extraordinary ways of smuggling that I have heard about in the last few days, of the list that the member for Dunkley produced, I understand that you can bring in fish spawn these days by taking the centre out of the biro, sticking it in your pocket to keep it at the right temperature, and daring anybody in Customs to start going through all your writing instruments. That came from somebody who ought to know, I understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that our primary obligation in regard to Australia's native wildlife is not to the international conventions. We absolutely should not need any international conventions to enable us to look after our wildlife and our biodiversity. We have fallen down on that very badly, and I do not think anybody disagrees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do not think that penalties and regulations are the only way to deal with the problem. As I said before, smuggling only works effectively when the rewards are high, and for some Australian species the rewards are very high. I am horrified when I see in the press the sorts of rewards that are available. Why would you write down&mdash;so that everybody can see it&mdash;that this species or that species is worth some vast sum of thousands of dollars and encourage every out of work 17-year-old to get into the business? It is quite an extraordinary thing to do, but then in some respects we do not expect the press to be always responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the rewards are high and that the smuggling of native fauna is going on apace; and that governments&mdash;this government, previous governments, state governments&mdash;have failed to stop it effectively. You would not need these amendments if we had stopped it. The blame is not to be sheeted home to anybody, and I agree that there has been much destruction of native wildlife by land clearing. I agree that there has been much destruction of native wildlife by introduced feral animals, and by the rabbit, which has destroyed vast areas of the environment of Australia over time and is still doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst you do not want viruses to escape from quarantine stations, I have been to Wardang Island, from where this latest calicivirus has escaped, and the quarantine arrangements that were put in place there were absolutely excellent. I cannot imagine how you could do it any better, unless you found an island further away, which is not all that easy and very expensive. In the 1930s, tests on myxomatosis took place on Wardang Island without the virus escaping from that island, although I think it escaped from the Mallee in the late 1940s and 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, we do need these viruses to destroy our major feral enemy. The rabbit has done more damage in this country than almost any other animal except man, and the quicker we can deal with it the better. That is an aside, but I will add to it, because the member for Dunkley raised an interesting point. If you are having a major rabbit program, you have to have a major fox and cat program at the same time. I do not think the foxes are all that difficult. It is a matter of money; it is a matter of strategies; it is a matter of planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cat is much more difficult; it is much more cunning. In certain areas in Western Australia they can use 1080 poison, as the native wildlife is relatively immune to it. But we certainly cannot use that poison on this side of the continent because our wildlife is not immune to it. We will have a problem with the cat, but we have got a problem with the cat and the fox right now. It is important to remember that when these viruses and these controls are released for species X, greater effort must go into species Y, which otherwise might cause a problem at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be concentrating on how we can increase the populations of some of those rarer species which are likely to be at the top end of the value chain, or, alternatively, we make it less encouraging for those who want to get into the smuggling business? Perhaps we do it by exporting more of our native species. I have to be very careful, because I know that everybody can get terribly emotional about this. But I would like to think about the possibility of using the very best of science and the very best of commercial abilities in some of these areas of our rarer native species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some very good examples. The first one is the campfire program in Zimbabwe&mdash;and we have just had the Zimbabwean delegation here in the last few days&mdash;which gives the locals some interest in the value of the local animals, in this case, elephants in particular. It is very sad that that damned drought is still going on in southern Africa after raging over the last four or five years with only small breaks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program is essentially trying to put some of the assets back in the hands of the local people and has in fact preserved the elephant population from the poachers in certain areas of Zimbabwe. I do not think we need to know how it is done, but those populations have been building up very substantially. I am told that the Zimbabwean government and other people in Africa are trying to extend that type of program to other species. I say, `More strength to their bow,' and we ought to be thinking about how we can do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I for one do not believe that zoos and government agencies are the only way that we should have breeding programs for native animals. John Walmsley in South Australia has shown, with rather mundane cat- and fox-proof fences, that native animals can survive very well without much more help. In other words, we need to have more intellectual input and to get rid of the old idea that governments can do all the protecting. I do not think that governments have the resources, quite frankly, and I agree with the member for Dunkley. One only has to think of the size of the coastline and the ease with which light aircraft can flop around from the mainland to the islands to the north; it is just an impossibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it will not apply to all species, we ought to be thinking of multiple ways of encouraging the commercial growing of the birds, the reptiles, the numbats, the bilbies and the what have you. There are some restrictions. States are rather jealous of those native populations&mdash;too jealous in my view&mdash;and something could and should be done about that with more consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An organisation in North America called Ducks Unlimited started as a duck shooting organisation years ago, with people providing money to preserve wetlands, swamps and so forth. It quickly moved from being a duck shooting organisation to a wetlands preservation organisation, and contributions come in from duck shooters, photographers, tourist operators, little old ladies who live in New York, conservationists and all sorts of people&mdash;everybody one could think of who is interested in the wildfowl and wetlands bird populations in North America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It quickly emerged that the resources from that private organisation were to be spent in Canada because Canada is the breeding place of the wildfowl population. Once a year, in four different fly aways, they all progress to the south, Mexico and other places, and then go back again in the northern summer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went to Canada this year to see how it is working. I know a fair bit about Ducks Unlimited but in the last four or five years it has expanded its operation enormously. It now has $US75 million of private money coming into the organisation every year; its budget for the next five years is $US500 million, so it is going to be $US100 million a year. They raise the money and it is donated by all sorts of means, as I said before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest idea of the organisation is to lease swamplands from farmers and owners on a 10-year or 20-year lease. For the short lease, the only rule is that the farmer is not allowed to disturb the soil in the leased area until after 14 July each year when all the birds have bred and gone. In the 20-year lease period, there is re-sowing of the areas with the native species that were there before European occupation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is hardly a farmer in Canada who does not know about the program, nor a farm that is not involved in some part of the program. After all these years of moving earth around and doing all sorts of wetlands stuff like that, they have really hit on a way of involving everybody in the program, more or less in the way that the campfire program does. There is a little money in it, probably enough to appease the owner. All over Canada, in Manitoba and Saskatchewan at least, and in other places where all the so-called potholes are&mdash;we would call them swamps or wetlands&mdash;they are using a lease program with the owners to increase the wildfowl population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an example of an enormously successful program which, even though it has been going for all this time&mdash;40 or 50 years&mdash;has in only the last few years hit upon a system whereby they can expand the wildfowl population. It would obviously not apply in Australia in that respect, because most of our wildfowl are grown in the big flood systems, in the Cooper, the Lachlan, the Murrumbidgee, the Darling and the rivers of Queensland and the Northern Territory and so forth. However, our big problem is that we do not have refuge areas when the things get tough, as they inevitably do in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible that we could be using the sorts of ideas that are developing in Africa and other places to expand our ideas as to how we are going to deal with this problem, which really is the essence of why we have to have so many regulations and so many penalties. In the small time that I have left, I wish to say that it seems to me, therefore, that we need to be looking at how we can expand these populations and give somebody the incentive, quite legally and properly, to expand these populations. Probably you have to allow them, in the end, to be able to sell some of the things that they breed, or certainly to show them, in an ecotourism sense. But all of that needs to be thought about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that, in schedule 5, paragraph 13(1) of the bill was proposed to ensure that native species not recognised as being readily captive-bred are not exported. I want to raise the subject which I have just touched on. What does `readily captive-bred' mean? I do not think it means necessarily what we used to think it meant, and that was that they could be bred by agencies in zoos somewhere. It could mean that, with an expansion of our thought processes, we should be trying to expand the way in which we breed these native animals. Why should not native animals in this country, like the penguins and the rest, be an absolutely giant tourist attraction&mdash;but not in zoos or in particularly controlled areas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I am delighted to see that some people are now starting to think about removing predators from areas that are much bigger than just a few acres&mdash;some hundreds or thousands of acres at a time. That is the sort of idea that we have to expand; otherwise all that we&mdash;and the people that follow us in coming into these chambers&mdash;will be doing will be expanding the penalties and regulations, yet still failing because of the enormous size of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just finish by raising the matter of one particular species. We have in South Australia a black cockatoo which is known as the Glossy black. It is a very delicate animal, feeding only on the seed nuts of casuarina trees. It does not look very mobile and it may be that the subspecies in my state has only 170 or 200 birds left.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would say that, on the surface of it, the game is all over and there is nothing to be done about it, because we have destroyed the habitat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are thinking that one of the reasons for the fall in numbers is that bees are occupying the places where the cockatoos normally live. Whatever the reason, it would be nice if somebody could be encouraged commercially to be able, with science and all the things that will be necessary, to reproduce a lot more Glossy blacks. If that were possible, why would anybody want to do it if they could not get some reward from it? Nobody could possibly put the money or the investment in, with a risk of failing&mdash;which is highly likely, I would suggest&mdash;unless there were some reward in it. We need to expand our thinking, not necessarily because we are going to sell all our wildlife overseas but so that people are encouraged to take some chances in increasing the native populations of wildlife in this country. </PARA>

As has been said by a number of people making contributions to the debate, the purpose of this bill is to improve import and export regulatory controls, ensuring the long-term conservation of native wildlife consistent with Australia's international obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora&mdash;CITES&mdash;and the Convention on Biological Diversity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in this bill arise, in the main, from the considerations of the so-called Ley report, the report of the review of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's protection and conservation of wildlife</EMPHASIS>. This amendment bill has been anxiously awaited. The director of the Australian Nature Conservation Agency said&mdash;perhaps quite rightly&mdash;in his introduction to the last annual report of the agency:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also disappointing that the Government continues to give low priority to amendments to the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 which would make administration of the Act simpler and more effective.</PARA>
<PARA>Later, the report said about wildlife protection and the legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A package of proposed amendments to the Act was agreed to by the Government in June 1993. To date, progress on the amendments has been limited due to the low priority accorded to them.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that is a bit of an indictment of us, but at last we have got around&mdash;some 2 1/2 years after the Ley report&mdash;to having this legislation before us, with amendments which, as has been stressed by the annual report of ANCA, are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that Australia has not had a long history of measures that attempt to protect wildlife. As the Ley report mentioned, between 1898 and 1912 Victoria, followed by New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania, passed legislation to protect species. This parliament's interest is longstanding and the first regulations were promulgated back in 1911. They were subsequently reviewed in 1923, 1933 and 1935, and they continued in force until 1959, when a close examination of export policy was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to bring it to the attention of the Main Committee that, in September 1976, a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trafficking in fauna in Australia</EMPHASIS>, was presented. The House of Representatives environment committee is a committee that I am a member of. It has a lengthy history in this parliament. It is probably the longest of the portfolio style committees that the House of Representatives has. At that stage the committee, whilst looking into the trafficking of fauna in Australia, concentrated in particular on investigations involving Australian bird life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the committee did make mention of the problems of trafficking of other forms, such as mammals, reptiles and fish, mainly the investigation surrounded the large trade in Australian birds that existed at that time. So it is disappointing when we can pick up articles in newspapers like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of, say, April last year, alleging that the amount of smuggling of stolen native birds, reptiles and plants is worth an estimated $20 million, from just the Cape York peninsula. It is a problem that, whether we believe those sorts of estimates or not, continues to be of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also interested that the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) raised the issue of the article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of November last year and quoted Dr Cogger, the Deputy Director of the Australian Museum. I think it is quite good and proper that people working in the scientific world should enter into debate about what the major ways are in which we can tackle problems like preservation of wildlife, preservation of endangered species and preservation of our biological diversity. But I think one should not get too overawed that pieces of legislation such as this are the be-all and end-all of tackling problems as outlined in this article. As the Ley report indicated, the control of the levels of exportation, the volume of international trade in certain wild animals and plants, is only one of the range of measures that we have to protect and conserve wildlife, not only at the federal level but, in the Australian federal system, at state and local levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have to look at things such as habitat protection; we do have to look at things such as establishment of national parks; we do have to look at scientific research into wildlife species and habitats; and we do have to set up systems such as registration of nature conservation areas through the Register of the National Estate. So it is not as if anybody is claiming that tackling the illegal trade in wildlife species is the be-all and end-all of it. I think it is valuable that people enter the debate and indicate that there are other things that impinge upon our ability to preserve our wildlife species. A comparison is made in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> article of November 1994 which quotes Peter Mirtschen, who runs a venom supply company in South Australia. Referring to eight state and federal agencies between 1984 and 1993, he is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between them, they successfully intercepted 950 individual animals or eggs of native fauna, mainly birds, being illegally exported by wildlife traffickers.</PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Mirtschen points out that the entire haul was the equivalent of the number of native animals eaten by one feral cat in one year.</PARA>
<PARA>That is okay; I accept that. And I believe that through other programs, and other arms of what governments at all levels are attempting to do, we tackle those things. But we cannot ignore that there has been continuing interest throughout this country's history and that, as signatories to the conventions that have been mentioned, there are also the international obligations that we have to fulfil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the point of the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) that perhaps these things are worthy to do, whether we have the international obligations or not. I think that is important. But, as has been stated by the honourable member for Dunkley, these problems are of a global dimension, so it is appropriate that the conventions such as the two that are involved with this bill codify the global action that needs to be taken. Then we can have some sort of confidence in the systems that are taken up by Australia through this legislation and also confidence that the obligations of other countries that are signatories and participants to those conventions are appropriate and proper. So we really have to realise that that is the importance of being able to have pieces of legislation such as this as part of our overall attempts to ensure that protection of wildlife is in place, and that protection of biological diversity is also in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often I do not think we talk enough about the potentials that science gives us to be able to tackle some of these things. I did overhear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) commenting that the speech by the honourable member for Barker was a good one and I would like to acknowledge that, too. In these debates there is a great deal of bipartisan support for the thrust of what is going on. There are often bipartisan minor criticisms, but I think they can also be taken on board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Barker talked about black cockatoos. One of the things highlighted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> article of January 1994 was that through the ability to use DNA profiling we are developing our ability to be able to assess whether or not animals&mdash;in this case, black cockatoos&mdash;have been bred in captivity. DNA profiling can compare the progeny to the parent stock and, therefore, there is some verification. The article indicated that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since DNA-profiling began, the number of cockatoo progeny declared by dealers has fallen sharply, indicating that many in the past were falsely recorded as captive-bred.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important that we continue to develop the scientific measures that will be of great assistance in our ability to monitor and, if required, enforce the measures outlined in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter how good legislation is and no matter how severe the prescribed penalties are, unless we take appropriate action to enforce the measures within the legislation, we will fail. The other arm to pieces of legislation such as this is that we ensure that enforcement can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ley report commented on enforcement and on the need to ensure that it was improved. Again, the consequent action that has to be taken after we legislate with bills such as this is that government&mdash;in this case, it requires cooperation between state and federal agencies&mdash;provides the resources to ensure that proper enforcement can be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reviewing the 1976 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, while flicking through the recommendations at first I thought that it was quaint that the last of the recommendations was that the Commonwealth government should provide the Bureau of Customs with two suitable aircraft and sufficient patrol boats to enable it to meet its responsibilities in northern Australia, and necessary support facilities and staff. That was a very specific catalogue of the type of infrastructure that was required. I only highlight that to say that 20 years ago it was a concern of legislators that the agencies that were involved in policing similar regulations and legislation to this bill had not been given proper resources. To a certain extent, that continues to be a concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the contribution by the previous speakers in the debate has considerable merit. There has been discussion about whether government agencies and publicly funded and managed zoos are the only things that we need to consider when we are putting in place appropriate programs to have captive breeding programs. I acknowledge that commercial concerns can play an important role but, at the end of the day, it is the responsibility of government to ensure that the framework that sets the standards and some of the goals that we wish to achieve is in place.

I do not think that we should shy away from this notion that in some way, if we get government out of things, everything will flow and work out right.

As I understand it, taxonomists classify different species. When we are out on inspections, we try to get a feel for what the real situation is and often agencies have to admit to us that they do not know the real situation. This lack of taxonomists is not a matter of resources but a matter of trying to encourage people to take on this discipline which plays a fairly important role in contributing to the gathering of our information base. </PARA>

These are important measures and, as I said, they should be seen in the context that they are important measures in an overall package that will try to achieve the aims that are set out in the conventions and, as has been illustrated by this debate, the aims shared by both sides of this parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Council has been in receipt of funding from several different agencies, including one or more of the Queensland Government. My answer is therefore confined to funding by ATSIC. In the financial year 1992/93 ATSIC provided over $1 million to the council, which included the purchase of a youth bail hostel ($755,000 for purchase and operating costs). In other years, funding was well under this figure, viz:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) An investigation by the Australian Federal Police released in February 1995 concluded that it may be possible to substantiate misappropriation in respect of Don Davidson for a number of personal services. It quoted an audit report which indicated a figure of $52,861 for invoices of doubtful authenticity in relation to cash cheques.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The references to upmarket hotel accommodation and hire cars appear to refer to funding provided to Gwandalan Halfway House, which I understand was approved by the Queensland Corrective Services Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Yes, and I understand that there was opposition to the appointment from some members of the Board. I am informed that there were relatives both for and against her action. Eventually, a new Board was elected, and it appointed the receiver/manager.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The new Board initially sought financial assistance from ATSIC.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) An investigative audit was undertaken by Arthur Andersen and copies were provided by ATSIC to the Australian Federal Police, the Queensland Police Service and the Australian Securities Commission for further investigation. All three of these organisations decided not to pursue the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Yes. ATSIC has received advice from the Australian Government Solicitor that the report should not be released because some parts of it may be defamatory, and to release it could render ATSIC liable to damages.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) I believe that it is most important when the Commission identifies serious financial mismanagement within a funded organisation that the matter be referred to the appropriate regulatory authority with responsibility for the incorporation of that organisation. ATSIC does not have the power to rectify the situation or the responsibility for such matters. This rests with the regulatory authority. In the case of the Brisbane Tribal Council, the appropriate authority is the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Securities Commission completed its inquiries and concluded that there was no evidence of any breach of corporation law such as would warrant further investigation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ComSuper did not make any error in its calculation of superannuation benefit payments from I July 1995. ComSuper's benefit payments were increased correctly in line with CPI from the first superannuation benefit payday in the 1994/95 financial year, which happened to fall on 6 July 1995. In accordance with normal processing procedures, details of these increased benefits were passed to the Department of Finance Pay System for deduction of taxation and normal processing to recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Medicare Levy increase from 1.4% to 1.5% was to take effect from I July 1995, at the time benefit payments for 6 July 1995 were processed by the Department of Finance Pay System, this increase had not received Royal Assent. The Department of Finance could not apply the increase to payments made through the Finance Pay System until the increase had received Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Royal Assent for the increase was received after payments for 6 July 1995 were processed but before payments for 20 July 1995 were processed, therefore the increase in the Medicare Levy was applied by the Finance Pay System from superannuation benefit payday 20 July 1995.</PARA>
