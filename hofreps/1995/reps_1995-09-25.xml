<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I extend my thanks to the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace), and to Mr Matthew Mason-Cox who prepared the report. Kangaroo 95 was one of a series of major Kangaroo military exercises that have been held since I was minister. They are essentially the major Australia directed joint exercise staged recurringly. This particular exercise was designed to emphasise the joint nature of operations, operations at the tactical level of war, and to further develop the procedures required for civil and military cooperation during short-warning conflict in the defence of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enemy forces were drawn from the fictitious island nation called Orangeland. Under the exercise scenario Orangeland mounted Operation Trojan Horse against Australia. Interestingly, the scenario designed by Orangeland was to obtain a rightful share of the region's non-renewable energy resources. I found that paradoxical because the Orangeland forces were headquartered at Nabarlek where we have one of the world's major uranium deposits. Thanks to the government's three-mine&mdash;I should say two-mine&mdash;policy, Nabarlek is in the process of being taken back to where it was with no mine. The headquarters of the Orangeland forces were stationed at one of the major sources of Australia's energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence elements from seven nations were involved in Kangaroo 95 in varying degrees. There were contingents from the United States, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Papua New Guinea. Unfortunately, we only saw in passing the hovercraft operated by the United States marines. As we comment in the report, the hovercraft cost about $20 million. It is apparently extraordinarily fast and seems to be very mobile, but I think it is quite impractical from Australia's point of view. We would have liked to have seen something of the other forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several aspects of the exercise that are worth commendation. Without any doubt, the first is the degree to which Australian forces took care of the environment&mdash;I refer not only to the portaloos, which were not camouflaged, which were apparent everywhere that the exercise was conducted but also to environmental practices with respect to the use of water and the fact that people were required to wear hats and so on. It was all a very important part of our approach to an exercise setting. It was worth while for other countries to see that and recognise the human rights values which Australian forces apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, I am totally in disagreement with the dissenting report by Senator Margetts. Indeed, she has made an observation about the participation of Papua New Guinea which, to my mind, is not only wrong, but&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite outrageous, as the honourable member for Calare says. I also wish to dissociate myself from this concern expressed at the last dot point on page 11 of the report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before and during the Exercise there was concern expressed by some sections of the community about the participation of foreign forces in the Exercise . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, that is an accurate observation. There was concern, but it was an inaccurate concern that did not reflect the fact that the more countries of our region which can exercise with Australian forces, the better chance they have of understanding the values which Australians apply in so many fields of endeavour. I think it is only through exercising together that there is any chance of that being passed on to other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We visited pretty well all the facilities. Our one initial concern, as we mentioned in the report, was that, unfortunately, we did not get an overall brief on the exercise at its beginning. We would suggest that, on any future visit by a parliamentary committee, a briefing such as the one given to us when we visited Darwin should occur at the very beginning of the exercise. That briefing was excellent. It was provided by Brigadier I.J. Bryant, Director-General, Joint Exercise Planning. Had we had that briefing at the beginning of the exercise, I believe the visit could have been even more worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I only want to pick up a couple of other aspects of the report. We did meet a diverse cross-section of uniformed personnel. We were concerned about some of the problems with family separation, particularly with respect to the 51 Far North Queensland Regiment. We have picked up a recommendation regarding problems with separation. We suggested they could perhaps use a light aircraft and a reserve pilot in order to improve mobility in that far-flung part of North Queensland, Cape York Peninsula. Of course, it would have to take account of the weather, particularly the cyclonic depressions that come through there from time to time. Also, some account needs to be taken of the problem there seems to be regarding the ratio of regulars to reserve personnel within the 51 Far North Queensland Regiment, particularly with respect to Q stores. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the parliament for allowing me the privilege of attending the Kangaroo 95 exercise. I would like to say, as members of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade always find, how impressed we were with the calibre of the people in our defence forces. That cannot be questioned. I was pleased to see the army reserve playing a great role there. As a former member of the reserve, I have always felt they were undervalued. I see that they are now playing an increasing role. I think that will be even more significant in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, along with the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), was surprised that we did not have a briefing when we first arrived on the scene. I understand that in future that will be taken care of.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that I was a little concerned about, having spoken to naval ratings&mdash;about which the member for New England has already spoken&mdash;is that some time ago when young people enlisted in the navy it was in order to go to sea. Now, going to sea is considered fairly onerous because most people can purchase a ticket to go overseas at any time, such is the nature of our country and our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One naval rating said to me that he found that when he came back from being at sea, the shore jobs that may have been available were not available anymore. He was spending a great deal of his time at sea. This places a great deal of pressure on family life. If we were on a war footing this would no doubt be better accepted, but I think the navy must look at this situation because there is ever increasing pressure on those naval families. The shore jobs, for whatever reason, do not seem to be available anymore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to dissociate myself from the dissenting report. It may be that the senator who put forward the dissenting report had contact with people before we arrived on the scene, but every person to whom we spoke was only too pleased to see our forces in the north and would welcome them back at any time. Certainly, no-one said to me that they were worried about foreign forces being in northern Australia. If we all wanted to put in dissenting reports, we could perhaps give a dissertation on the Steyr rifle, the type of ammunition being used, or that we were not happy with the chefs that were available. We could all do that, but we were there as part of the Defence Subcommittee to observe Exercise 95. If we want to put forward a particular philosophical view, this report is not the place to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was surprised the other day listening to a person who is actually doing some defence studies saying that we have no problem in Australia of any potential enemy for the next 15 years. I do not know who has been lecturing him, but I would say we really have to be on guard at all times. We have to make sure that our defence is secure, and exercises like Kangaroo 95 will do that. I am sure the value is there and, of course, there will be a critical analysis of the exercise in the future by other people more expert than I am. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like, once again, to thank the parliament for the privilege of being able to attend this exercise and to comment on the calibre of the people in our defence forces. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to support the comments of my colleagues, particularly the acting chairman, the leader of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I would briefly like to make a passing reference to the dissenting report and express my disagreement with the tenor of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 11 of the report there is a correct reference to the concern that was expressed both before and during the exercise by some sections of the community about the participation of foreign forces in the exercise, including Indonesian forces, and I think that reference should be taken into account. In my view, the dissenting report does have the potential to create in some people's minds the belief that the defence committee was engaged in an analysis of the whole defence posture of this nation. Of course, that was not the case and the report tabled here today that we are talking about has nothing to do in that broad general sense with the defence posture and it should be seen in that context. I hope that, when Senator Margetts speaks in the Senate, she makes it absolutely clear that the task of the defence committee in going to operation Kangaroo was to observe and to report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was delighted during the exercise to be able to meet a young naval officer whom I saw when he left school in Albury-Wodonga and to whom I was able to give some assistance and advice in his pursuit of entering the naval services. I refer to Lieutenant Andrew Greg who was the executive officer on the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Labuan</EMPHASIS> which transported us very efficiently to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS>. I was very pleased to see the calibre of Lieutenant Greg and his colleagues and the way in which he is advancing in the naval forces. It is particularly pleasing to see someone from one's own electorate doing so well and I congratulate Lieutenant Greg and his colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I wish to raise briefly is the strong impression that I got that we must always be very vigilant about our defence. Seeing the vastness of northern Australia and operation Kangaroo 95, it was very obvious to me that we have to make absolutely certain that the Australian defence forces are maintained and supported because of the immense task that we would have in the event of an emergency, in the event of an unfortunate incident with another country, of defending our shores. That is why operation Kangaroo and the involvement of the Australian forces with the other nations is absolutely important&mdash;it is an opportunity to test out and to evaluate, out of which we learn many things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also very pleased to see the presence of reserve forces. Being a former member of the reserves myself and having a strong, continuing interest in the potential of the reserves, I was interested to have brief conversations with some of the reservists. That confirmed my view that a lot more should be done in our defence policy to involve the reservists more and more. There is an enormous potential for that and that was confirmed by my observations and discussions with some of the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also a great opportunity for members of the defence committee to speak directly with personnel. For example, one naval personnel member told me that he had a master's ticket, obtained by private study, which was accepted by the Maritime Services Board but that that certificate and qualification was not accepted by the navy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found that situation to be rather intriguing. I therefore just mention that incident as an opportunity, as a member of the defence committee, to get a deeper understanding of some of the issues that cause members of the services to be a little resentful and to question whether their career path is adequate. Sometimes it even leads to us losing some of these people who have been trained in certain areas. It is an opportunity for us to evaluate what is going on and for us to hear information directly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to see how readily the members of the various defence forces took the opportunity to speak informally to us. That is another indication of the value of operation Kangaroo. It does give them the opportunity to speak directly to parliamentary representatives from all parties who have an interest in defence. I commend the defence forces for their contribution to this exercise. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to speak briefly to this report and associate myself with the remarks of my colleagues the member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) and the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) and also to emphasise that I fully dissociate myself from the dissenting report by Senator Margetts. I think enough has been said about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What all of us found in looking at Kangaroo 95 was that we were very impressed with the professionalism and the dedication of the defence forces of Australia. I think our troops performed extremely well in their role in the Kangaroo 95 exercise. When it comes to training and equipment in the current situation I think all of us were very impressed. I did have a couple of reservations that I would like to briefly touch on. The first one is whether or not we have sufficient troops to properly defend Australia; the second is the question of command coordination and whether or not that is sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the things that does come through is, notwithstanding the last 10 years of moving towards an integrated defence force, there are still very clear distinctions between the army, the navy and the air force. I do wonder whether or not this may create some interference with proper command and control. While I think the complexities of modern defence planning are well known, the fact is we still have to question whether the government has put sufficient effort into planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come back to my first point, the personnel numbers are reaching a critically low level. I think if we were to allow them to fall any further we could create some very serious problems in having sufficient troops available to respond were there a threat to our sovereignty. I think the other point that has come through very clearly in talking to members of our defence forces and to their commanders is that the cutback in numbers has led to an increase in stress amongst many of the troops, both the regulars and the reservists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was demonstrated was that with the lack of backup personnel in some units many people were forced into undertaking additional service requirements often to the detriment of their family. It was pointed out that marital breakdowns are all too high. I do not wish to in any way denigrate the efforts of our service personnel, because I think dedication to the service remains a matter of some pride amongst them, but we do have to acknowledge that they need realistic numbers to be able to do the job adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, this is not to decry the enormous investment Australia has made in modern equipment, such as the locally made Anzac frigates and the Collins submarines, and the purchase of our FA18s and F111s. The point is we do have to get a balance. We have to recognise that personnel are needed and the training required these days means that you cannot recruit overnight. Therefore, we have to acknowledge this is one very serious concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee in the report's final remarks has covered most areas. There are 12 points made on page 13 and 14 which go into some detail on the observations we made. There is no doubt that there is concern about the possibility of the likelihood of paying off the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS>, particularly given that it is a relatively modern ship and the important role it plays in moving personnel and equipment around Australia and where needed. The other concern was shortages in personnel, which are causing problems in the home lives of those in our services. This will have to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is well served by its personnel. We have every reason to be proud of their professionalism and the contribution they make to ensuring that this country remains a free country. </PARA>

I do not want to delay the proceedings of the House a great deal except to say that, like my colleagues from both sides of the House, I totally dissociate myself from the agenda and the comments of Senator Margetts that are included in the minority report associated with this report that has been tabled today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great joys of belonging to this subcommittee is working with a group of people right across this parliament in a way that the general public is not necessarily convinced happens in this parliament very often from the 30-second grabs they see on television each night. Here is a good example of a bipartisan approach taken to a very important defence issue. We are fortunate indeed that virtually every member of the committee has a great interest in defence, some of us having had the privilege of serving as part of the executive in the portfolio of defence at one time or another and other people having the opportunities because of the location of defence bases within their electorates to have some direct involvement as well. </PARA>

There are always going to be stresses and strains associated with operating a modern defence force in a time when there are always pressures on the military budget. But again, during this exercise, apart from the odd hiccup that some members have commented upon, we saw a very professional group of men and women who did us proud in serving, and paying great attention to, the profession of arms.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;There are several things I should say. Firstly, the need for a lead joint commander we have addressed in the report. There are problems because it appeared that the flotilla's commander of the amphibious task group was not responsible to the commander, northern command, but to the maritime commander. I believe that needs to be addressed in future exercises. Secondly, there is the problem of air mobility for the army. There is no doubt that there were difficulties with the grounding of the Nomad aircraft and problems with the Black Hawk helicopters. Also it is essential that we look at the early acquisition of airborne early warning and control aircraft&mdash;again matters which were identified in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter is the strong integration of women. Given the difficulties there have been in some sectors with the role that women will play in the Australian Defence Force, we were delighted to see women in a range of environments during the exercise. They should be commended, as should the relationship between the sexes. I trust that the final remarks on page 13 and 14, which the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) raised, and the particular recommendation in the report do generate a response from the ministry. There are matters within those comments which are worthy of long-term consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report deals with the committee's review of the 1993-94 annual reports of the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The report focuses primarily on the Reserve Bank. However, a major issue dealt with in the course of the review is the use of financial derivatives. As derivatives are used in all areas of the financial services industry, the committee felt it appropriate to also seek the views of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission regarding the supervision of the derivatives used in the insurance and superannuation industries. The outcome of those discussions is included in this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before outlining some of the matters covered in the report, I would like to make a few comments on the importance of this process of reviewing the Reserve Bank of Australia's annual report. The committee regards the opportunity of using the authority the committee has under standing order 28(b) to examine annual reports to be a very valuable tool for committees to improve the accountability of departments and agencies to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the second report that the committee has made on matters arising from the RBA's annual report. This process has facilitated increased scrutiny of the role and functions of the Reserve Bank. It has also enabled the committee to continue to oversight issues and developments in the banking industry, as well as in the wider financial services industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central role played by the Reserve Bank in supervising the banking industry and the bank's important role in setting monetary policy underline the need for parliamentary accountability. This process provides a rare opportunity for members, through the committee system, to canvass issues with the Reserve Bank and to seek the views of the governor first-hand. While it was not the primary focus of the review, the committee continued to take advantage of the governor's appearance to canvass a number of issues related to the economy and monetary policy. Most of the matters discussed were of a general nature and are not canvassed in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two matters that the committee felt worth reporting: the Reserve Bank's two to three per cent inflation target; and the use of prudential requirements to restrict lending for housing where the loan was for more than 80 per cent of the value of the property. With regard to the latter, the committee was not particularly concerned at the use of prudential measures for macro-economic purposes. It was concerned, though, that this measure had the potential to impact disproportionately on those members of the community who were not in a position to save for large deposits. It was not clear that this factor was taken into account when the Reserve Bank made the decision. This is an example of where parliamentary scrutiny can make the RBA more accountable for its decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of economic policy, the committee has also concluded that an increased focus on monetary policy issues in future reviews will assist in meeting the committee's broader objective of improving the process of accountability to the parliament. The committee is of the view that there is an imbalance in parliamentary accountability on the development of monetary and fiscal policy. Through the appropriation bills, parliament extensively debates fiscal policy but no such scrutiny is afforded to monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that it can play an important role in this process by requiring senior Reserve Bank officials to appear regularly before the committee and by inquiring into and reporting on contemporary issues and debates concerning monetary policy. The committee will begin to develop this process in the next review. However, I must emphasise that this does not mean that the committee will be moving away from its concern with prudential and consumer issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major topic dealt with in this year's review was the use of financial derivatives. The committee took detailed advice from both the Reserve Bank and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The committee recognises the importance of derivatives as risk management instruments. Nevertheless, the importance of supervision was clearly demonstrated with the sudden demise of Barings earlier this year. There is no possibility that the Reserve Bank or, indeed, the other financial supervisors will ever be in a position to be thoroughly familiar with all the new products being developed in the field of derivatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1986 the Reserve Bank has been monitoring the involvement of banks with derivatives. Over recent years, it has intensified that monitoring and has developed a comprehensive approach to regulating their use. (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Extension of time granted</EMPHASIS>) The Reserve Bank has participated in the international approach to regulating the use of derivatives through the Basle committee on banking supervision. The thrust of the approach adopted by the RBA has been to require that adequate capital is being held against risk and to ensure that banks have appropriate risk management regimes in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is satisfied that the Reserve Bank has adopted a responsible and thorough approach in dealing with the potential risk that derivatives pose to the stability of the financial system. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission has only just begun to address the question of derivatives. The ISC has issued a series of discussion papers for the insurance and superannuation industries. The committee is generally satisfied with the ISC's approach; however, there is some concern with regard to superannuation. The reason for that concern is that the ISC knows very little about the extent to which superannuation funds use derivatives products. The principles set out in the discussion papers are fine; however, they are still at the discussion stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emphasis now being placed on superannuation and the fact that it will represent the life savings of many Australians make it imperative that those savings be afforded the maximum possible protection. The committee is of the view that the process initiated with the release of the discussion papers needs to be advanced as a matter of some priority. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the Treasurer monitor the implementation of the ISC's proposals for the use of derivatives by superannuation funds and report to the parliament at the first opportunity in 1996. The committee will also be following up this process after the ISC's 1994-95 annual report is tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other issues canvassed in the review process. The committee has a longstanding concern that the effectiveness of the Australian banking industry ombudsman scheme could be improved by increasing to a more realistic level the monetary limit placed on complaints and by increasing the scope of the scheme to include small incorporated bodies, such as small business and rural producers. The committee has held discussions with ombudsmen from the UK, New Zealand and Ireland. The schemes in those countries address the issues of financial limits and incorporated bodies. Their apparent success indicates that the reasons put by the banking industry for resisting change are of doubtful validity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also pressed for an increased use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms by the banking industry in order to avoid unnecessary resort to more formal and costly legal processes. The banks have all agreed with the need to avoid litigation where possible. The committee believes that it is time to have a look at the processes that they have developed and implemented. The committee has recommended that it be provided with a reference to inquire into the effectiveness of alternative dispute resolution in the banking industry, including the role played by the Australian banking industry ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One pleasing aspect of this review was the fact that the banking industry, through the Australian Bankers Association, took the opportunity to raise a number of issues of broad concern to the banking industry. While the committee was not in a position to examine those matters in detail, it will take them up in the next review. Two issues that the committee has highlighted in this report are the proposal by the ABA for the right for banks to have retirement savings accounts and concerns over the levying, by state governments, of the financial institutions duty and the debit tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was impressed with the proposal to introduce retirement savings accounts and is of the view that it warrants further investigation. The committee has recommended that the Treasury examine the proposal for the establishment of RSAs and provide a response to the committee in the course of its review of the RBA's 1994-95 annual report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee will be interested to learn more about the strategies being developed by Australian banks to service Australia's trade with Asia. We endorse the ABA's views that Australian banks are dragging the chain in participating in trade growth with Asia and in servicing those customers who are becoming more involved with trade with Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of interest rate margins and fees was prominent this year. The committee did not pursue those matters due to the conduct of an inquiry by the PSA.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our consideration of the annual report of the Reserve Bank gives the committee a very worthwhile opportunity to discuss with the Reserve Bank a matter which is vital to the public interest: the ongoing integrity of Australia's banking sector, which affects all Australian citizens to a greater or lesser extent. As part of this process, the committee also meets with the Australian Bankers Association and from time to time also takes the opportunity to meet with executives from the main banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary scrutiny of the Reserve Bank's annual report gives members of this committee and the parliament an opportunity to debate a number of important matters. The state of Australia's economy is a matter for constant debate in this place. There is widespread and understandable concern about the current account deficit and foreign debt. The Reserve Bank plays an important role in setting and administering monetary policy. Therefore, it is vital that this parliament has some direct interface with the Reserve Bank. The Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration provides that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monetary policy is one of the vital tools&mdash;or levers, if you like to adopt that terminology&mdash;which a government has to manage the economic affairs of this nation. The Reserve Bank indicated to us, and this is confirmed in its report, that it is committed to the maintenance of a low inflation regime in Australia&mdash;a rate of around two per cent to three per cent per annum. The bank commented on the difficulty of getting people in this country to think in terms of low inflation, especially with an environment where home owners in particular have had in the past an expectation that higher rates of inflation were beneficial&mdash;an argument that I think can be shown to be somewhat fallacious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, it is difficult for the government to achieve lower unemployment, lower inflation and low current account deficits in the present environment. I am sure that the committee, when it meets shortly with the Reserve Bank Governor, Mr Fraser, will be interested to raise with him the comments of one of his directors, Professor Bob Gregory, who noted in the past few days that growth rates of between 3.5 per cent and four per cent will lead inevitably to rising inflation as well as a falling Australian dollar and rising foreign debt. I am sure that will be hot on the agenda for our next meeting with the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of matters have been discussed by the committee specifically. Some of them have been referred to by the chairman. In respect of housing lending&mdash;this matter affects most Australians&mdash;the bank expressed concerns that the extent of the growth rate in this business was a worry. To quote the Governor, `because of the risk of sloppiness creeping in', the risk weighting for housing lending was increased to 100 for lending more than 80 per cent of the value of a property. This action was criticised by the ABA, which took the view that this action was more an attempt at demand measurement than a prudential measure. The committee takes the view that public policy should facilitate home ownership wherever possible. It is a desirable investment for Australian families and individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman mentioned the considerable time that the committee devoted to the question of derivatives. In the present context, there are some very legitimate concerns about derivatives. In the end, the committee concluded that it was reasonably satisfied with the Reserve Bank's approach to focusing on ensuring that adequate capital is being held against risk and that banks have appropriate risk management regimes in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ombudsman scheme came up for discussion again. Once again, the committee came down with the view that it is satisfied with the scheme, although, as the chairman mentioned, we are recommending some changes, particularly to increase the scope of the ombudsman's activities to include incorporated bodies and farmers. The ombudsman scheme is very important, although it is fair to say that most banks&mdash;as most responsible business citizens are&mdash;are motivated to solve problems with their customers. The ombudsman scheme is an important adjunct to that process, as is the code of practice, which is largely being implemented. I notice that it came up in question time last week on the matter of the uniform credit legislation which needs to be introduced in each state to effectively facilitate the extension of that code of practice to all banks. I understand that that is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of superannuation remains a very important one on the agenda for public policy debate in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The Australian Bankers Association has expressed the view that banks should be able to offer a retirement savings account as part of that superannuation regime. I am pleased that the committee essentially agrees with that view and has recommended that a closer look be had at that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue that the committee devotes a lot of time to and which is also of concern to the vast majority of Australians is the question of margins, fees and charges. The Prices Surveillance Authority, as the chairman said, has devoted considerable time this year to that matter and has made a number of conclusions and recommendations. These will come into focus as we discuss the bank's latest report in the next month or so. It is obviously a hot political potato. I am sure that, in the end, the committee takes the view that the banks are entitled to make profits. It is in the best interests of everyone to ensure that the banking sector is strongly competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting in that context to note the Trade Practices Commission's latest decision to allow Westpac's bid for Challenge WA to go ahead on the basis that it would not substantially reduce competition. A decision came down virtually at the same time by the WA government to sell Bankwest to the Bank of Scotland. Certainly the committee takes the view that it is in the best interests of Australians for the banking sector to be as viable and competitive as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) in the House at the moment. I observe as an aside his almost bordering on hysterical criticism from time to time of the banks for some of their activities. He went a little short of suggesting the nationalisation of the banks. The committee has to view these things objectively. As I said at the outset, this committee does its job thoroughly. It focuses on the facts. In response to questions of the Reserve Bank about the facts in some of these matters, it came to light that Australia, in many respects, is fairly much lineball as far as international comparisons on these sorts of issues are concerned. I commend the work of the committee to the honourable member for Lilley in particular if he wants to make himself aware of the facts in relation to margins, fees and charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, I observe in that context that we should not overlook the fact that state governments themselves impact on that particular matter because of FID and DT.

One of the things I mentioned was that when you put the phone up to your ear 50 per cent of the radiation from that phone actually goes into your head.

Obviously, this problem is starting to raise consciousness with the general public and in this House and I am glad that is coming about. I notice in an article in Sunday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> that another area of concern was raised in relation to mobile phones. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People with implanted heart pacemakers should avoid using digital mobile phones, two European studies have found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The studies show that digital mobile phones can cause dangerous heart fluctuations in people with permanent pacemakers if carried or held too close to the implanted devices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Swiss researcher found that mobile phones upset the function of the pacemakers in 18 per cent of cases.</PARA>
<PARA>They are a possible danger to health not only through various radiation concerns but also if you have a pacemaker. Mobile phones also affect the use of hearing aids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a leaked study recently on electromagnetic radiation. You get a bit of radiation from mobile phones, but this study  mainly talks about the radiation you get from VDU units, the electric clocks in your bedrooms, overhead power transmission lines and that sort of thing. The jury is still out in this area. No-one really knows whether it does cause problems, so I urge people to be wary of using or even sleeping near electronic devices and things like that. You really do not need a mobile phone all the time and you can live without having a digital alarm clock close to your head or even the electric blanket on your bed. If you go to sleep with your electric blanket on, your body is collecting these electromagnetic rays all the time. So people should just be a bit a wary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mobile phone issue has been on a crescendo in the electorate of Dunkley. I have a letter here from some people in Pearcedale, in which one of these towers is proposed. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On our visit to the Council we learned the station to be erected at Lloyd Park Langwarrin is in fact Vodafone&mdash;which results in two Vodafone stations, a mere 5 KM separating them, not as we thought 30KM.</PARA>
<PARA>I have not found out as yet why Vodafone would want to put two stations within five kilometres of each other, but I shall be determining that. I always thought stations had to be 30 kilometres apart, but Vodafone has these two only five kilometres apart. Sometimes this is because they are in an area where the rays cannot reach. For example, if the station is in a valley, there has to be an extra station. But I do not know why Vodafone has to have just five kilometres separating the two stations. As I have said before, base stations are going up all over the place. Telstra and Optus also want five kilometres between stations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These towers are most unattractive, especially to people who choose to live in areas of natural bush or with wildlife, and properties will immediately be devalued.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 June I placed a question on notice to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) raising concerns held by many people in my electorate about the recent and uncontrolled proliferation of telecommunications towers in Adelaide. I have not received an answer. On 26 July I wrote to the minister asking, amongst other things, when he expected a revised national telecommunications code to be finalised. I have still not received an answer to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituents want to know what the minister is going to do to protect their rights which have been totally eroded by the government's decision to exempt telecommunication carriers from state and local government planning laws. They are still waiting for answers. Such is the failure of this government to respond to legitimate community concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is widespread public concern about the government's decision to exempt carriers from the planning laws by which other developers abide. The chairman of the Austel review of the existing telecommunications national code has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The weight of opinion expressed to me during the public hearings has been strongly in favour of local government being given a role in the decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the existing code, the role given to local councils in this process is little more than tokenism. In my electorate, local councils that have tried to stop towers being constructed have found themselves ignored by the carriers. In the Enfield City Council area of my electorate a telecommunications tower was erected at Days Road. It was erected in one day in the rain contrary to the wishes of residents and council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present code allows a community, through its local council, to have a tower proposal reviewed by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, to which carriers are answerable. But, in practice, this mechanism does little to curb the power of carriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, councils that have been notified of a proposal to erect a tower have a mere 30 days to notify and consult with residents and, if required, formulate an objection. This is simply not enough time for councils to exercise what little power they have. Secondly, the cost of such an undertaking is also prohibitive since there is no compensation for councils which engage in the consultation process. The arrogance that the government has cultivated amongst carriers is well illustrated by the circumstances surrounding the proposal to erect a tower at 29 Grassmere Road in the Prospect City Council area of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I received a call from an Adelaide businessman, Mr Cruse, who owns the site at Grassmere Road on which Vodaphone is insistent it shall build a tower&mdash;contrary to council and resident opposition. On the remainder of this site the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service engaged Mr Cruse to design, construct and lease to it a building. Subsequently, the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service decided that it did not wish to proceed because of the tower that was to be co-located on the site. Keeping in mind that Mr Cruse has not signed a binding agreement with Vodaphone, it is clear that it is in Mr Cruse's interests to stop the use of his land by Vodaphone if that is what it takes to ensure the future of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps, not surprisingly, Mr Cruse has found himself powerless to stop the construction of the tower on his land. The current disregard for communities' rights being displayed by telecommunications carriers has been allowed to go on for too long. People have found their local environment disfigured by mobile phone towers emitting microwaves&mdash;microwaves which have not yet been definitively proven to be harmless to those who are continually exposed to them. The laying of cables by carriers is beginning to pose a similar set of problems for communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing code which regulates the behaviour of the carriers involved in the roll-out of telecommunications networks is simply not adequate. A new and tighter code with more power for local councils is needed&mdash;and it is needed now! This government cannot continue to use reviews as a way of avoiding action. The latest review of the telecommunications national code must be completed within the next few months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to speak today on the siting of telecommunications towers to facilitate mobile telephone services. There are two concerning issues that I would like to raise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first issue relates to a rally which took place recently in my electorate on the siting and construction of a telecommunications tower at All Hallows School in Five Dock. The system, as outlined in the telecommunications national code, did not work adequately in this situation. The local council claimed ignorance in relation to their rights and obligations in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this information should not just be provided to councils via general administrators but rather to mayors, councillors and aldermen who must be made aware of and responsible for not only these rules but also their obligations. There is no question that under the telecommunications national code councillors do have a right and/or an obligation if they have any concern about these towers to thus take up the matter with the Environment Protection Authority and also, from there, the Australian Radiation Laboratory. This was the case in Harbord but not in Five Dock&mdash;and, therefore, no residents were consulted about this tower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) has written to councils reminding them of their obligations, and I too will be writing to councils in my electorate to inform them once again of their rights and obligations under the telecommunications national code. If councils raise obligations to these towers on their potential effects on local residents, this at least causes some consultation with the local community. Adequate consultation with the local community was totally absent in Five Dock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vodaphone, the company involved, is also a signatory to the guidelines&mdash;guidelines which were developed in association with the Municipal Association of Victoria&mdash;which require carriers to consult with the local community in a situation where they are placing a tower in a high impact area. I would think that next to a school is a high impact area; certainly, next to a school or a child-care centre where children are playing outside for prolonged periods must be deemed to be a high impact area. This consultation should have occurred via the carrier in the case of Five Dock, irrespective of council's failure to act in this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All three carriers have said that they will abide by the guidelines of the Municipal Association of Victoria, yet in this case&mdash;although Vodaphone had consulted with the priest at All Hallows, who had then consulted with the parish council and other parishioners&mdash;Vodaphone had not undertaken sufficient community consultation prior to the contract and the construction of the telecommunications tower. This consultation could have taken place in a number of ways: via a letterbox drop, doorknocking, an advertisement in the local press or a public meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meeting against the siting of this particular tower was exceedingly unpleasant and nasty for all of those involved&mdash;and I am sure that no carrier would want to go through that experience again. People need to be consulted where any potential question of safety hazards is involved. My understanding is that the work on the tower has now ceased. Certainly, I would be failing in my duty as a representative for my electorate and community in Lowe if I did not bring to the House the stress, angst and frustration which the construction of this tower has caused in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken the step of writing a submission to Austel, the organisation which has been conducting an inquiry into the placement of towers and an appropriate code of conduct, and I would like to read part of it to you. Certainly, before doing so, I should point out that we all realise that mobile phone usage is growing, that people want an effective and low priced system and we know that these towers have to be placed somewhere. But the CSIRO at this stage is saying that there is insufficient scientific evidence. In my submission to Austel, I have said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although there is no evidence which categorically links the transmissions from telecommunications towers with risks of disease the general public has made this association. Given the fact that this is new technology and no iron-clad guarantee can be given that electromagnetic transmissions won't result in cancer or deformity in ten or twenty years time there is only one real option.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Telecommunications National Code must be modified to deal with public demands for greater caution. Common sense dictates that we must at least tread a cautious path where there is even a remote threat of the well-being of infants and children in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am therefore strongly recommending that the Telecommunications National Code be modified to ban the construction of telecommunications towers within 300 metres of schools and childcare centres or other potentially high impact areas where children regularly congregate.</PARA>
<PARA>Or, for that matter, where adults regularly congregate. I continued:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public opinion seems to be the only force which can have any effect on the plans of the telecommunication carriers to build these sometimes grotesque structures. For example, three carriers recently planned to erect a facility on a disused water tower in North Beach, at the southern part of my electorate. On the face of it, that might seem a reasonable course of action were it not for the fact that the tower has been restored and is used by the local historical society as a museum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision was strongly opposed by concerned local residents, the North Suburban Historical Society and the Coastal Heritage Society. I too am opposed to the erection of the tower, continuing my efforts to have the federal government rethink its communications policy which sees telecommunications companies able to build such facilities in any location without the permission of local residents and councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the decision was announced to place a transceiver on the Mount Flora tower, I released a media statement calling on greater consultation between the company involved and the Stirling City Council. In addition, I wrote to the council to voice my objection to the structure. Subsequently, the company, under pressure of public opinion, agreed to co-locate the communications equipment it needs on the nearby police tower. I am pleased in this case that community pressure was able to obtain a satisfactory resolution to this problem on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This success seems to be a rarity if the number of plans to build towers that have surfaced in recent months is any guide. In fact, my opposition to the erection of such towers with community consultation goes a long way back. When another company announced it would build a freestanding tower in the centre of Joondalup over a year ago, I immediately wrote to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) to express the concerns of local residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister told this House, in answer to a question about this matter, that he had agreed to require phone carriers to pursue greater community consultation in future plans. Unfortunately, I have to say that that promise seems to have been rather empty. It is similar to some of the other promises peddled by the three major phone carriers. In frustration, in November last year I placed a private member's motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> in the House which called on the government to allow councils a veto over objectionable plans by big communications companies. Hence I am pleased to support the motion moved by the member for Warringah. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effects towers are having and may have on my constituents are growing rather than receding. Take, for example, the Barnes family in Ocean Reef. This family contacted me on learning that they had no way of arguing against a 35-metre high tower that was to be erected 60 metres from their property line on a nearby hillside. Mrs Barnes wrote to me saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I strongly protest that the tower will be less than 60 metres from my property and will have a detrimental effect on the value thereof.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I open my bedroom window (which faces the hill) I don't want to see a tower 35 metres high staring straight back at me. I'd much rather see trees and nature. That is another thing you (the phone company) don't realise . . . that you are destroying the homes of animals and birds that might have nests in trees nearby . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Barnes is right, of course. She bought her property in good faith, knowing there was an existing tower on the other side of the hill beside her house. She accepted that when she paid for her house. What the Barnes family cannot understand, and what thousands of other families across this country cannot understand, is that mobile phone service providers can arbitrarily erect a structure anywhere they want without recourse to local councils, state government and, for that matter, the federal government itself. The Barnes family and dozens of others who have contacted me are also wary of the possible health hazard an uncontrolled proliferation of facilities may cause. I refer to some of the comments made by the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) in relation to the waves that are emitted from these towers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to change the telecommunications regulations to give local councils, which are closer to the needs of the people than the managers of the carriers could ever be, the power to veto proposals in the public interest. This motion simply calls on the government to admit they got it wrong. The minister erred when he granted carriers these draconian and unlimited powers to proliferate their facilities mindless of the legitimate concerns of the community. I commend this motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>To a very large extent the motion speaks for itself. I have taken the opportunity in the wording of that motion to congratulate Franca Arena for her initiative in seeking to arrange an appropriate form of protest by members of parliament throughout Australia in Papeete, Tahiti. I have congratulated Oscar Temaru and Bruce Childs on the responsibilities which they have been given in relation to a new organisation, Parliamentarians for a Nuclear Weapon Free World. I have also congratulated Tom Wheelwright and Ian Cohen on their courage in going on a relatively small vessel to Mururoa Atoll in order to extend the protest and to make it more effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crux of the motion, the essence of the motion, is that it calls on President Chirac to halt these acts of violence against the people of the Pacific and against the conscience of the world. I have referred to some particular people in the wording of that motion, but I want to refer to others&mdash;other members of this parliament who, on their own initiative, went to Tahiti to join a world protest against the resumption of those tests. In addition to me, there were Robert Bell, Bob Charles, Bruce Childs, John Coulter, Paul Filing, Chris Gallus, Clyde Holding, Colin Hollis, Bob Horne, Peter Knott, Dee Margetts, Allan Morris, Shayne Murphy, Sid Spindler, Tom Wheelwright, Harry Woods and Trish Worth. I emphasise that there was no compulsion on those people to go to Tahiti in order to participate in that protest. They did it of their own volition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to emphasise as well that it was representative of every major political grouping in this parliament, including Independents. It does not include the National Party. I think that was more coincidental than anything else. I do not believe and I hope that the National Party did not boycott the protest. Arising from that initiative by Franca Arena, in addition to Australia there were other countries represented on that small island out in the middle of the Pacific that day. People came from all around the world to participate in that protest and to march arm in arm and hand in hand, singing in unison in order to protest against this abominable decision which has been taken by the French President in order to continue those tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to recognise as well that, arising from that initiative by Franca Arena, not only were there parliamentarians from Australia but also parliamentarians from Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, the European Parliament, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, the United Kingdom and the United States. From all of those countries members of parliament went to Tahiti to record their protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was inspiring and encouraging to be in Tahiti. On Saturday, 2 September in Papeete, the capital of Tahiti, 10,000 people marched in protest. At least 9,500 of those people were not from other countries in the world. At least 9,500 of them were Polynesians. As I have said, there were 35 members of parliament from Australia, including those from this federal parliament whose names I have previously indicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Sunday, 3 September in Nuuroa Beach park, Parliamentarians for a Nuclear Weapon Free World was formed. Oscar Temaru is the inaugural president and Senator Bruce Childs is the secretary. With this decision to resume the tests, France has earned the wrath, the condemnation and the outrage of the world. It has broken its own nuclear test moratorium, which it entered into last year with the United Kingdom, Russia and the United States. It has threatened the possible success of the comprehensive test ban treaty scheduled for next year. It has encouraged and provided some legitimacy to China in the resumption of its tests. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to follow the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) in this debate. In general, I support the thrust of his motion. I want to refer to the effect that these tests which France will carry out in the South Pacific are going to have. France is sending a message to the non-signatory nations of the non-proliferation treaty that atomic weapons are important. France is in the privileged position of having nuclear weapons and of supporting the non-proliferation treaty for those countries which have signed and which cannot have them. However, at the same time it is sending another message to countries like India, which is a non-signatory to the treaty, that nuclear weapons are important and that it will continue to use them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would the other countries not ask of France: if it is so important for you to have nuclear weapons, why shouldn't we? The message that France is sending to the world is that it intends to keep its nuclear arsenal and that it sees it as an essential part of its own protection. We might ask why France sees that as necessary. Who is the enemy that France has in mind? If it cannot specify the enemy at present, why is the same condition not applied to other countries? France has sent a very negative message to the rest of the world on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Pacific, France has shown a total disregard of its wishes. That is not to ignore that there are people in Tahiti who support France's position on this. Perhaps one of the saddest things that I saw in Papeete was a sign which said, `The bomb means jobs.' I think that is a comment on the legacy that France has left in Tahiti. That island is dependent for 20 per cent of its economy on the testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the environmental effects these tests will have in the Pacific. Why did France not choose to carry them out in France? I think the answer to that is clear. Can you imagine France doing it in the Pyrenees and being able to get away with it? Physically there would be no difference, but can you imagine the outrage of the French citizens and the rest of Europe if France tested its bombs in Europe? Instead, it will carry out the tests in the Pacific, where the people of the Pacific have less power. The environmental effects may not be immediate, but it is concerning that iodine 131 will remain in the area for a week. France has claimed that this is contained in the atoll, but there are fissures in the atoll and there is a definite and clear chance of both leaching and leakage. Of that, we have strontium 90 with a half life of 29 years and caesium 137 with a half life of 130 years. If these two radioactive substances leach into the Pacific, there will be a definite environmental effect on the marine life of that area, not to mention the flow-on effects to the Pacific islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, the message sent out by this group of parliamentarians who chose to participate in the demonstration at Papeete has been very positive. It has helped to focus the attention of Europe on what is happening in the Pacific and on this wider issue of France thumbing its nose to the rest of the world by testing these nuclear weapons and setting a double standard with respect to the nuclear proliferation treaty. So, if nothing else, what we did by going to Papeete was to keep world attention focused on what France is doing in the Pacific and to give the people of the world the opportunity to say no to France on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members will recall the difficulties experienced between Australia and France over French testing in the mid-1980s. I also note that actions were taken before that by New Zealand. When I was France in 1992 the issue of French nuclear testing was raised with me by members of the French-Australian Friendship Parliamentary Group. At that stage, Mitterrand was backing off on the tests, and the difference that course of action made was enormous. At that time, the programs between our two countries were very strong and we were developing a rapport. It has been absolutely appalling in recent times to watch that relationship being shattered by the actions of the French President and not the French people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extremely important that during this quite difficult period we set three objectives. First and foremost, we must maintain solidarity with our neighbours in the South Pacific. We are one of many countries in the South Pacific. At the moment, we chair the South Pacific Forum, and that responsibility is a very important one. It is important that we act in unison with the people and the countries of the South Pacific and that we represent them as best we can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is critical that we differentiate between the views of the President of France and those of the French people. That is fundamentally important. From my experience&mdash;and I have been in contact with French people for a long time&mdash;I do not believe that they would agree with what he is doing. Thirdly, we should seek to unify world opinion against the French President, and that is already happening. In that context, the visit by parliamentarians from all over the world to Tahiti a few weeks ago assisted in the attainment of those three measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, our visit instilled enormous pride in the Tahitian people because of the fact that people from other parts of the world were interested in seeing them and talking to them. That gave an enormous boost to their morale. I found them to be very gentle people. As someone commented earlier, they are the pacifists of the Pacific. They are very undemonstrative people, which is why the events of some weeks later were so appalling. They sought very little. When talking to them individually, particularly the younger ones, we found that they were extremely grateful that we thought enough of the issue to actually visit them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other poignant point relates to the Japanese. Japan is unique in the world in respect of its experience with nuclear energy. It is the only country that has been a victim of it, and it has a special right in my view. The comments by a female survivor of Hiroshima, who was at the meeting on the Saturday night, were extremely poignant and very important to all of us. The Japanese nation has focused on these tests like never before. What Chirac has done to France in that context is absolutely irresponsible. He has made France the focus of not just world attention and world concern but also anger. The French people do not deserve that; they do not warrant that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion refers to the formation of a parliamentary group, which is an enormous initiative and one which has importance here and now. The removal of atomic weapons from the world arsenals should be a major concern for all of us, and I am sure that it is. In his own way, Chirac has given a boost to that movement, and I am sure that in the time ahead parliamentarians around the world will get stronger and will work more closely together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot speak in this debate without making some comment about the domestic situation in Tahiti. When I was in France the French parliamentarians raised with me the question of indigenous people&mdash;as they should; when we visit countries, we raise with those countries our concerns, whether they be human rights in East Timor or situations in Europe or eastern Europe. We do not normally interfere or involve ourselves too strongly in the domestic politics of a country, but many people in Tahiti would like Australians to think about what is happening there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is sinking in, and what is becoming quite clear, is that Tahiti is now part of Europe, in French terms. It means that any European can visit Tahiti without a visa and can buy and settle within three months. A French citizen in Tahiti can vote and any European citizen has a right to vote in Tahiti after six months residence. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support in principle the motion by the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and to congratulate him on bringing this issue before this parliament. Several weeks ago, when it became apparent that the French President, Jacques Chirac, would defy world opinion and continue with nuclear tests in the South Pacific, though they had been abandoned some time ago, I put a petition in various spots in my electorate. In less than two weeks, over 6,000 of my constituents signed the petition, abhorring the actions proposed to be taken by French President Chirac.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it was proposed that Australian parliamentarians from both state houses and this federal parliament proceed on a ship to Mururoa, to Tahiti, to protest together with other parliamentarians from around the world against this action by the French, I was delighted to represent my constituents and my own views, and I continued on the aircraft to Papeete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For me, a protest of this nature was a first. I have never protested before. It was a unique experience. I am told that my friends from the left do not often see supposedly right wing politicians in such protest marches. On that Saturday morning, the heat, the light and the colour, and the sound, the vibrancy and the smell&mdash;the atmosphere associated with that protest&mdash;were beyond description. It has meant for me a memory that will live with me all my life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were parliamentarians from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, from all over central Europe, from Scandinavia, from North America and South America&mdash;and, of course, many from South Pacific island nations. I thought one of the most important things about the protest march itself was the array of international politicians joined together at their own expense in protest at an action that we all feel&mdash;and most of the world feels&mdash;is simply wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years ago I had the opportunity to participate in my one and only parliamentary representation visit, to five Pacific island nations. We visited Papua New Guinea, Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Western Samoa and Tonga. During that trip I came to the view that Australia, for a very long time, had seen itself as a piece of Europe, somehow transposed in this huge island in the South Pacific. Today our Prime Minister, Paul Keating, would like us to think of ourselves as a piece of Asia. I think that both of those views are flawed. We are the biggest player in the South Pacific. We are a South Pacific nation. We are a country which is perhaps the greatest melting pot of the world's humanity that the world has ever seen&mdash;and a very successful one&mdash;and we represent the views of the world. In this demonstration and protest, when we went to Papeete, that is what we as Australian politicians were doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we have a responsibility for those little Pacific island nations out there. They have a tough time trying to make the transition between market economies and today's modern, highly competitive and highly mechanised industrialised world. It is very difficult for them. The Pacific island image that we have in our heads perhaps no longer exists and, unfortunately, may never again exist, not as we would wish it to be. It is part of our responsibility to try to help them with this transition. In that respect, France has no place exploding nuclear weapons in our part of the world&mdash;in our patch&mdash;and against the wishes of the native islanders throughout the Pacific and the now native islanders on the biggest player of them all, Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was proud to have been a part of the delegation; it was a tremendous experience.

But I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) for putting up this private member's motion today and to say that I certainly agree with the spirit of that motion. Perhaps I would have worded it slightly differently, but I think it gives members from both sides of this House&mdash;and an Independent as well&mdash;an opportunity to come in here and speak on an issue which is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are elected to this place to represent those people in our own districts and our own areas. In the time that I have been in this place I have never found an issue that has so united people of different age groups and different backgrounds with their strong opposition to nuclear testing. Peace is a fragile thing, something requiring vision to achieve and something that requires some effort to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world is becoming a smaller place, with communications becoming more sophisticated, but there was nothing terribly sophisticated about our protest. We went to Tahiti as individuals and, as the mover of the motion said, Franca Arena is to be congratulated for having the initiative. I am sure that at times the organisation was lacking. That was no-one's fault in particular. It was just that there were people coming from all around the world&mdash;from all the countries that have been mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we gathered for that protest march there were doubts in my mind as to whether we would ever get under way. But it all happened. Many of the locals were very smart, because we covered the whole distance in that heat and they joined in along the way. Part of what made it so spontaneous was the fact that people came out of their homes, they lined the street, they greeted us and they were warm towards us. There was no hint in the time that I was there of any of the violence that was to follow as we flew out and the French exploded that bomb. The protests that were beamed around the world were really quite a shock, certainly to me and I am sure to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing was that we came together from around the world to give the French government a very clear message. As other people have said, I do not believe that we hold any grudge against the French people; they have a government that is letting them down very badly. I hope that they make their protests known and known very strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a good experience to meet with delegates from countries such as Germany and Denmark, who are closer geographically to France, but I also felt that we were very much part of the Pacific. Countries such as Japan, New Zealand and Australia obviously feel very strongly about this issue. While I went there without giving a great deal of thought to the local politics of French Polynesia, one certainly could not help but be affected by it, because the reality is that this French testing would not be taking place there if French Polynesia was not a colony. While the majority of people there at this stage claim to support the French and say that they are French, as the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) said, the fact that there could be signs up to the effect that they relied on the economy of the bomb is a sad reflection on the inheritance that they are receiving from that French colonialism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The true issue for the world is that we must be creating an environment where nuclear tests will not be held and where nuclear weapons will not be produced. That is not to say that&mdash;along with many others, I am sure&mdash;I do not recognise that since the end of World War II possessing the bomb has been a disincentive to further warfare but I would like to think we have moved on from that. I would like to think that many parliamentarians will join in this group to be known as Parliamentarians for a Nuclear Weapon Free World. While it might take some time to work through a number of issues to achieve that, that should be our aim as members of parliament in this place representing those people in our electorates who feel so strongly about this issue. </PARA>

Perhaps I should state initially that, whilst we are all united on the view that nuclear testing should not take place, I will not go as far as saying that we might all be united on the view that there should not be nuclear weapons because I am not sure on that point. But I go a little bit further than most of us are able to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 25 years, I and many people like me have been substantially against the nuclear industry in total. To my young children and to people who do not really wish to get into the technical aspects of nuclear testing and radioactivity, the argument against the nuclear industry overall can be put into a very simple argument. If you have a house on a quarter acre block with a fence and, instead of using your toilet you use your backyard, eventually you will get sick. I know it is very base imagery; nevertheless, it is true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where my opposition to the nuclear industry lies, because there is no nuclear toilet. There is no safe way of disposing of radioactivity. There is no safe way of shielding human beings from the biological effects that radioactivity has upon us. Sure there is natural radiation in our environment, but I would suggest to you there are also natural cholera viruses, et cetera. There is no point in exploiting, enlarging or enhancing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the world, though it be a big place, is very small. Eventually the actions of the French at Mururoa and Fangataufa, the actions of the Americans, the actions of the British, the actions of the Chinese and the actions of our own Australian people in the nuclear industry will have horrendous consequences on the biological entities that we humans are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second point I would like to make is the position of the French in the world today. Why is it that we object to them having a nuclear testing program and nuclear weapons? I cannot speak for other people but I can speak for myself. My grandfather left one lung, two-thirds of his other lung and 35,000 of his mates on the shores of France in the First World War. My family was also involved in the Second World War fighting for France and freedom and democracy&mdash;the place where all of us believe democracy first started in the modern world and where the people of France stood up said, `We are the people.

At Villers-Bretonneux they said, `We will never forget you, Australia.' Well, unfortunately, the government has.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I journeyed to Tahiti with my colleagues for the purpose of representing, in the first instance, not merely my own views but the views of my electorate. I have been in politics for some time now, both in state and Commonwealth parliaments, and the strength of people's feelings was driven home to me when in a matter of four hours outside my electorate office in Melbourne Ports some 6,000 people lined up to sign a petition against nuclear testing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing I enjoyed and felt was significant was that this event was the one occasion that I can remember in the history of Australian politics where a delegation represented basically every political position in Australia. That is something we can all be proud of. We are used to having disagreements about all sorts of issues, but amongst those of my parliamentary colleagues at state and federal levels there was a uniformity of view and a commitment. Friendships were born in that situation. We found ourselves reaching out to each other, with the support of the indigenous people, on an issue which has truly embraced not merely the people of the Pacific but the people of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate and sad that France, under the existing government, has denied, in a sense, its own history, its own culture and its own contribution to world civilisation by the actions in which it is now involved. The reality is that we met with people in the local assembly who described themselves as French who had dissociated themselves with the independence movement. They made it perfectly clear that, despite their very best endeavours, they were unable to debate this very important issue in their own assembly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assertions made by the existing government of France&mdash;which does not speak for the French people on this occasion&mdash;that this is really a domestic issue is polemical and political nonsense. When we first got off the plane, the first question I was asked was, `With respect, what right have you to be here interfering with our politics?' The answer is simple. The answer was given in 1914. The answer was given in the last war. You have only to journey to Villers-Bretonneux, a decisive battle in which the Australians figured large, to see the ages on the gravestones of young Australians. You have only to look at the list of some 11,000 Australians who are missing and lying in unmarked graves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is our right, and I am not going to accept any assertion that says on an issue as important as this is to our region that we do not have a right. Not only do we merely have a right but we have a duty to speak on this issue, as we have spoken with one voice and with one principle. I found it interesting that, having been on many of these demonstrations over a period of time, some of my political colleagues felt the solidarity and the comradeship that grew out of this very significant political event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps there will come a time when other events in our own internal domestic politics will enable us to speak with one voice. On this occasion I think one can say that all members of this delegation, coming as they have from the cross-stream of Australian politics, spoke generally with one voice and with one commitment on behalf of the people of this nation. To be part of that was to not merely fulfil one's duty as an Australian parliamentarian, but it was a positive assertion that we are all part of mankind and that we are not going to sit back and see one group of people being dealt with in the way in which the local people are being dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that France is locked into its own polemic on this occasion, but it is a polemic which has a face which will not survive the emerging forces that are appearing in our own region. I thank all my colleagues who participated in this important event. I thank them for their comradeship. I thank them for their commitment. Perhaps&mdash;I hope not&mdash;we may well meet again in Tahiti on a future occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this motion. I concur with the comments of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) that one of the great features of this particular visit was the solidarity of members who may have had some differences of opinion on the aspects of the independent issue but were united on the central matter of the tests. We were unified. At the demonstration on the Saturday, and the consequent meetings, there was consensus that reflected the widespread community opinion in Australia opposing the resumption of these nuclear weapons tests&mdash;tests which are opposed by more than 60 per cent of the French population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took a great deal of pride in presenting to the high commissioner of French Polynesia a letter from the mayor of the city of Wanneroo&mdash;the largest municipality in my electorate&mdash;representing the views of the city which is quite fundamentally opposed to the tests. I was proud to have the opportunity and the ability to join my colleagues and represent the views of my constituents in such a way. It allowed people to see that, even at a time when they perhaps think that no-one else is listening to them, their voices are heard at the very centre of where these things are being decided and enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My wife is French and I have a number of French in-laws who share my views and the views of our delegation about the tests. By and large the French are a very civilised nation. Unfortunately, Mr Chirac's government is out of kilter with public opinion which is quite clearly against the resumption of these tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that these tests have more to do with domestic French politics than anything else. In recent times we saw some very serious incursions in the municipal elections by Le Pen National Front&mdash;the extreme right-wing political force in France which has been steadily gaining influence at the expense of the traditional right. This has obviously caused Mr Chirac to bring these tests back, under pressure from the French military, at a time when quite clearly there is absolutely no reason for nuclear weapons testing by the French&mdash;except, I might say, if you were to look at the cynical aspect of the initial test and the much more powerful one they have announced that they intend to conduct in the next couple of days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is talk of the testing of a neutron bomb by the French. For those who are not familiar with a neutron bomb, it is a nuclear weapon that does not destroy property but issues a tremendous dosage of radioactivity sufficient to cause extreme radiation sickness. People become ill very quickly and die within a very short time after the exploding of the weapon. It was designed for the European theatre of war during the Cold War. If the Russians had invaded western Europe, presumably the neutron bomb would have been used as a means of stopping the Russians from going any further. It was a weapon that was developed in the first instance by the United States. The United States, however, recognised the immorality of such a weapon and stopped development of it. On the scale of all nuclear weapons it would represent the worst case. I am not suggesting for one minute that the others are more acceptable. I am just saying this one happens to be a particularly perfidious example of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we have the French government resuming nuclear tests at the expense of the people who live in our region&mdash;at the expense, quite clearly, of the Polynesians who will be depending very heavily on tourism as a principal source of revenue in years to come and, of course, will have seen that opportunity to extract revenue from their tourism industry diminished by the fact that within their island group they have had these tests conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also point out, Mr Deputy Speaker, my grave disappointment at the behaviour of the British government on this matter. They have been absolutely pitiful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also there is a necessity for us to make sure that our protests are heard loud and clear in relation to the Chinese nuclear tests. The difference is: one country has a democratic system and the other one does not. One asks oneself how many Chinese citizens have had the opportunity of registering their view about these tests conducted in their midst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I congratulate the members of the delegation who went to Papeete and the tremendous effect we had on the issue. Quite clearly, the French would like to say we stirred up the problems that have occurred since. </PARA>

<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, I bring before you and fellow members of the House a health issue&mdash;in fact, a chronic health problem&mdash;that profoundly affects some 20,000 Australian young people, in addition to an indeterminable number of `undiagnosed' or `misdiagnosed' adults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am speaking of attention deficit disorder&mdash;commonly referred to as ADD&mdash;a rather simple but somewhat misleading term that encompasses a medical menagerie of symptoms ranging from aggression, anti-social behaviour, domestic violence and criminality through to complex psychiatric disorders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to the House on this issue before. However, for now, let's turn our attention to the raw facts about ADD. It affects at least five per cent&mdash;yes, one in 20&mdash;of every school aged child in Australia, in addition to at least two to three per cent of adults. Overall, it affects at least 20,000 children&mdash;who will soon become 20,000 very lost, confused and misunderstood adults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixty-five per cent of these children will have more middle ear infections than any other member of the population&mdash;and subsequent short-term, recurrent hearing loss. Sixty per cent of these children have some bi-motor difficulty. The condition is likely to become more widespread, as it is proven to be genetically passed from one generation to another. Some 20,000 today&mdash;but how many more when these children reach maturity, and the age of child-bearing and child-rearing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the facts and figures dehumanise this particular condition. These children suffer&mdash;and suffer greatly. So profound is their lot, that they cannot even understand reality as we know it. Their normal day is a nightmare of disjointed thoughts, with an obscure relationship to time. Medical experts are only now beginning to unravel the threads, symptoms and expressions that together weave the pattern of ADD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is not about pointing a finger at who is responsible or not. This issue is not about under whose portfolio this issue arises or relates. This issue is not about politics, government or factional distinctions. This issue is about children and their right to the best quality of life we, as a society, can offer. This is about the future&mdash;and ensuring that we are providing every opportunity for Australians to be as healthy as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I urge you and my colleagues to undertake the following actions: acknowledge that attention deficit disorder is a medical condition, rather than a behavioural disorder; express concern at the limited resources with federal and state government funding dealing specifically with ADD; note that an unreasonably large percentage of the community is affected by the medical condition ADD; express concern at the ongoing social ramifications of ADD, and the inadequate response of policy makers to cope with the condition; express concern at the lack of specific funding within special education expenditure for children suffering ADD; and call on the government to review education expenditure with the intention to improve resources available to adequately address the needs of children suffering ADD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By responding to these issues we will ensure that ADD is not only recognised but accepted as a real condition. With such acceptance comes tolerance and understanding. In reality, this is all that the ADD sufferers and their families are asking. We cannot legislate to change attitudes, but we can encourage and nurture an environment of social justice and tolerance towards all people, regardless of background, religion, impairment or any other, let us say, `feature', be it a physical, emotional or psychological difference, which sets one Australian apart from another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a nation we have many health issues to face, and face them we must. Health is not a domain of the privileged or of a chosen few.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you do not need me to tell you once again that the matter of attention deficit disorder is beyond being stamped urgent; it is now critical. We must now take immediate yet well planned action. As a nation we can no longer put the issue of ADD in the too hard basket, as we have with other issues in the past. My recommendations, I believe, are appropriate and workable. They tackle the issue head-on using pro-active strategies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a rare occasion in this House that the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and the member for Moreton would agree on a matter but on this occasion I absolutely agree with the member for Cowan in his motion. I come to this issue not through my political opportunities as a member but through friendship. One of my close friends has a child who suffers from a specific learning difficulty&mdash;not ADD but one of the specific learning difficulties associated with ADD in that they are classified as general learning difficulties that children have. On my desk I have piles of papers and reports from a great range of authoritative people in education who have all arrived at the same conclusions that the member for Cowan and I have&mdash;that this is a medical condition and not just a behaviour disorder. Behaviour disorders are a result of the medical condition that the children suffering from ADD and specific learning difficulties have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a range of different learning difficulties that affect children that are not fully and properly recognised in the education system or properly diagnosed. These cause enormous problems for the children concerned and for their parents. The essential feature of attention deficit or hyperactivity disorder is a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity, and impulsivity that is more frequent and severe than is typically observed in individuals at a comparable level of development. Some hyperactive or impulsive or inattentive symptoms that cause impairment must have been present before the age of seven years, although many individuals are diagnosed after the symptoms have been present for a number of years. One of the problems is that the children often are left too late before they are properly diagnosed with this problem and therefore have not received adequate attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are we concerned with this issue? Firstly, as the member for Cowan said, somewhere between five and 10 per cent of children have some specific learning difficulty and at least five per cent have attention deficit disorder. This means that five per cent of children in our schools are not able to receive an adequate education because the whole education system frustrates their everyday life and they are not able to gain from the education system what they could gain. It is important to understand that these children are not intellectually impaired. They cover the broad range of intellectual capacities that exist within our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the brightest children in our schools suffer from attention deficit disorder or other learning difficulties and therefore their intellectual abilities are not being developed in the education system. Frustration at their inability to develop through the schooling system leads to a general frustration with society, which then has major costs on society. We are not developing these children to their full potential and therefore are not able to give them all the life opportunities they should be able to enjoy because we failed to diagnose the medical condition they had. Secondly, what has been proven through the court system is that a very high level of delinquent behaviour can be directly linked to attention deficit disorder or other specific learning difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These children take their frustrations out on society because society and the education system have failed them, so they engage in petty vandalism, in graffiti and, often, in violence because of their frustrations. They are too heavily represented in the court system. If you were able to track down all the kids going through the court system, I think you would find a great number of them have had attention deficit disorder or other learning difficulties. Also, ADD often leads to high levels of suicide or attempted suicide amongst young people because they can no longer tolerate the frustrations that their medical condition creates for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is absolutely urgent for state and federal governments to accept their responsibilities in this area and provide a much broader array of funds to the schooling system and to parents so that they can provide, firstly, the medical treatment that enables them to tackle this problem and, secondly, so that their schooling system is better provided with the skills and the resources to ensure that these children are able to receive an adequate education to fulfil the opportunities that their intellectual capacities will enable them to do. I fully support the motion, and I congratulate the member for Cowan on bringing it before the House today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also congratulate the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) on raising this subject today because it is thought that attention deficit disorder afflicts many Australian youngsters, up to five per cent of those under 18. Attention deficit disorder is also the subject of considerable controversy; and public policy, as it relates to ADD, must successfully navigate its way through these controversies if it is to be effective. There have always been difficult children but, generally, they have been treated as having behavioural problems rather than as patients. Most of the world still takes this view. England and France report one-tenth of the US rate of ADD, and in Japan the disorder has hardly been studied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Researchers generally suspect a defect in the frontal lobes of the brain which regulate behaviour, but some psychologists question whether ADD is truly a disorder at all or merely a set of characteristics that tend to cluster together. Several studies have shown that people with ADD have depressed blood flow and lower levels of electrical activity in the frontal lobes than normal adults and children. What researchers do say with certainty is that the condition is inherited. Diagnosis is not always well handled. Many who treat ADD see recognition of the problem as a humane breakthrough but worry that the disorder, if embraced too enthusiastically, can be used to avoid taking responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most cases, parents trying to explain away why their child is daydreaming in class, failing to complete assignments or driving everyone crazy with thoughtless behaviour stumble across a list of ADD symptoms in a book, on talk-back radio or during meetings of parents with children of similar problems, and so rush off to a doctor to get a prescription, says a Melbourne paediatrician, Dr Oberklaid. Dr Oberklaid argues for proper assessment. He says that the real problem may not be ADD at all, but something as simple as mild deafness or as serious as a psychiatric disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Diagnosing those who have attention deficit disorder without hyperactivity can be tricky. Such children are often described as daydreamers as they are not agitated or disruptive but, says Roseman, `They sit in front of a book for 45 minutes and nothing happens.' Many girls with ADD fit this model and are misunderstood or overlooked. Mark Stein, the director of a special ADD clinic at the University of Chicago concedes, `We need to find a more precise way of diagnosing it than just by saying that you have these symptoms.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are questions about the boundaries between personality and pathology, but it is agreed by researchers that when the traits are so extreme that they interfere with people's lives then the behaviour is a function of pathology. There is no doubt about the fact that lives can be affected. These young people often have few friends. Their parents may be blamed and ostracised by their neighbours, relatives and teachers for failing to have adequate influence over their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parenting skills are called into question. School can be a shattering experience for these young people. Frequently reprimanded and turned out, they lose any sense of self worth and fall even further behind in their work. These children can be accident prone, but worse still are the psychological injuries that are caused. They can lie and steal and as adults will have problems with substance abuse, mostly with depressants like marijuana or alcohol. While early intervention is obviously highly desirable, researchers are still uncertain exactly what optimal intervention should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best known therapy remains a stimulant drug such as ritalin. Some children have anti-depressants prescribed. Overprescription of ritalin has become a major issue in the US, but there are stories of how the lives of young people and their families have been improved and changed by use of the drug. There is consensus that, whether or not drugs are used, these disruptive young people should be taught behaviour modification, how to gain more control over their impulses and how to be better organised. This all takes considerable effort on the part of the children, parents, teachers and professionals giving assistance, with praise being an important ingredient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is argued that, whether ADD is a brain disorder or a personality type, the degree to which it is a handicap depends not only on the severity of the symptoms, but also on one's environment. The right job, the right school or home situation can make all the difference. All kids do not learn the same way and nor are all adults suitable for the same line of work. Unfortunately, modern society seems to have evolved into a one size fits all system. To acknowledge these problems is to acknowledge the need for changes in public policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too congratulate the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) for bringing this matter before the House as it focuses on children, who are the most undervalued group in our nation. Although I listened with interest to the previous speakers and although they have all raised some valid points in relation to the issue of attention deficit disorder, I happen to be in a minority in this debate and remain unconvinced that ADD is a medical condition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Attention deficit disorder is not a disease. I am not attempting to argue that there is not a problem with children who suffer from what is described as ADD. But a question raised here today is whether it is a medical problem or a behavioural problem. I contend that it is most likely to be a genetic/environmental problem which flows on to behavioural problems in young children. I acknowledge that the member for Cowan mentioned that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that attention deficit disorder comes within the normal range of children's behaviour, albeit at the lower and upper limits. The issue is: where does normality stop and abnormality begin? As a teacher and a principal for some 25 years with the South Australian education department I saw at first hand children who fell into this so-called ADD group. I believe that even from birth children are able to work out parental behaviour; that is, what works and what does not. By this I mean that even a newborn baby appears to know that if he or she cries then he or she will be picked up, cuddled, fed and attended to in some form, be it changing a nappy or nurturing in some way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Attention deficit disorder is just that; a disorder not a medical problem. Are we simply drugging children into passivity or submissiveness? Currently, Dr Florence Levy from the University of New South Wales is studying the disorder in 2,300 pairs of twins. She hopes her study will be able to separate which behaviours have a genetic basis and which may be due to environment. For example, the core problem may be that children are easily distracted and their aggressiveness may be a reaction to how parents and teachers handle them. It is generally known that attention and activity level vary across different environmental contexts and at different times during the day for most individuals, including children with attention deficit disorder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my contention that all children need consistent caregivers, be they parents, grandparents or teachers. In my experience as an educator I found that in nearly every case children from homes where consistency in parenting was paramount on the whole performed a lot better than children from homes where parents were indecisive and continually changed their minds, attitudes and responses in similar situations. This also applied to the classroom. Children always responded better to teachers who were consistent and fair, and who treated them with respect. Are doctors overinterpreting the results of the test called neurometrics? The test has cost Medicare and parents large sums of money but it is unproven and may have overdiagnosed the number of children with ADD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that neurometrics testing is largely performed in New South Wales, which has 10,000 drug treated children. An important problem in assessing ADD is that evidence of pervasiveness is needed to show that inattention, impulsiveness and hyperactivity are not specific to certain situations. For example, it can be displayed in school but not at home, or only in some school and home situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I briefly touched on a little earlier, a common finding on ADD is that children with this disorder tend to score below normal comparison levels on IQ and achievement tests but are frequently still within the normal range. Medication has not proven to be the answer. Some research indicates that approximately 50 per cent of children on medication improve. But the results all seem to indicate that those children not on any medication whatsoever also improve at the rate of approximately 50 per cent with behavioural control and, in some cases, food elimination diets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures seem to demonstrate that approximately 50 per cent of children have no improvement even with the use of medication. Perhaps resources from state and federal governments should be directed to assisting parents and children develop a discipline system both at home and in schools. We should also ask ourselves who benefits when we come to the question of power and money. An analysis of the answer to that would prove very beneficial. Perhaps as politicians we should be a little more naturally suspicious and wary of tests costing Medicare $297 per time and $180 for a couple of times as a repeat dose, and drug costs for families of up to $50 per month. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Attention deficit disorder, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, is a condition that has always existed, but the term has only come into being over the last 15 years or so. It describes one of many symptoms, mainly in young boys. Five to 20 per cent of boys can exhibit some degree of it, and 80 to 90 per cent of all cases are in males. It is unlike other disadvantages in society, which often are visible, readily elicit sympathy from the rest of the community and encourage corrective measures to be put in place. In a sense, ADD is a hidden handicap. To that extent, it represents a potential loss to the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These children can go off the rails and go on to drugs, become liars and cheats and end up in gaol. They are often the brightest and potentially the most creative of all children. Leonardo da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin, Winston Churchill, Beethoven and Einstein were believed to have suffered from ADD in their early years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The symptoms are many. One or more of these symptoms by themselves fall into the normal category. They take into account a brief attention span&mdash;hence the name&mdash;hyperactivity, distraction and restlessness. There can be a loss of concentration whereby you go into a daydreaming state. You get increased activity levels in many of these children. They exhibit impulsiveness and incoordination&mdash;they are clumsy&mdash;and they have a weak short-term memory. They are inflexible in their attitude; they are very dogmatic and they cannot adjust to changing situations. They fly into tempers, which distresses their parents. They have diminished self-esteem and peer relationship problems. They often exhibit sleep disturbances, appetite changes and speech disorders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ADD is largely genetic. It is inherited mainly through the male parent. If one identical twin has it, there is a 90 to 100 per cent chance that the other child will have it. They think it is due to a lack of neurotransmitter fluid in the synapse between two neurones. This fluid is necessary to transmit the message from one neurone to another. If that fluid is in insufficient quantity or is destroyed in large amount by the enzymes that regulate any normal surplus in that area, you get a breakdown in the transmission of messages. This seems to peak in children of primary school age and usually, but not always, improves after they turn about 12 or 14. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many things to do for the treatment and management of this disease. Behavioural therapy is very necessary as it moves the child from negative to positive experiences and reinforces their good habits. Remedial teaching parental involvement is very important to identify and utilise the strengths to overcome the weaknesses the children show. Speech and language therapy is crucial, particularly at school. Occupational therapy is also important, especially with fine motor coordination such as tying shoe laces, et cetera. There is a high level of cross-dominance from left handed to right handed with eye, hand and feet, and this has to be recognised. Dietary control is important to identify noxious foodstuffs, such as chocolate and cola, and eliminate them from the diet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drug therapy is a very vexed question. Dexamphetamine is already approved but it does not work for some children. Ritalin is not approved yet for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, even though the advisory committee has recommended it be approved. The company that makes it has not been able to come to agreement with the government and it is costing many parents $70 to $80 every three or four weeks to treat their children, which is putting an excessive burden on those parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation is very distressing, and it is something I would urge the government to sort out as quickly as possible. The drug ritalin does have a very beneficial effect on a high number of these children, though I do stress we have to be very careful when diagnosing and administering these drugs to children because their long-term effects are not yet fully evaluated in society. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has often been queried as to why these drugs&mdash;dexamphetamine and ritalin, which are known as `speed'&mdash;have a hyperactivity effect on adults while they have the opposite effect on these children. This is what is known as the paradoxical effect, because it slows them down. It is thought to be due to the fact that these drugs increase the level of neurotransmitter fluid, which is deficient in these children. It may also decrease the level of uptake of the cells that put out these neurotransmitter fluids. It is also thought to improve the receptiveness of the level of the neurotransmitter that is released, and it inhibits the enzyme action on these neurotransmitter fluids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, they lift a low level of neurotransmitter fluid to a normal level. If you give these drugs to an adult, they lift a normal level to an increased level and you get an undesirable effect. Therefore, if you are normal, you do not want to be using these drugs but if you have a low level these drugs can be very beneficial. We have to be wary of the side effects of the drugs because they can cause a loss of appetite, particularly when the drug is first taken by children. This can lead to weight loss. It can also lead to temporary insomnia. It can lead to early fatigue after the drug is first prescribed. It can lead to headaches, to dizziness, to blurring of vision in some children and also to temporary depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing we want is doctors over-diagnosing this disease unnecessarily and using these drugs as diagnostic tools, or using them as `calmer' drugs, as they are called, in children who may have some other condition or who exhibit only a very low level of ADD. In these conditions, it would be irresponsible to be overprescribing this drug. We have already heard of instances where up to 20 to 30 per cent of children in some classes in America are on ritalin. Heaven forbid that we ever get to that state in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would hope that, where the drug has a proper and beneficial therapeutic use, it would not be held back because of some reticence to use the drug. I do believe that the government should do everything it can in its negotiations with the company that makes ritalin, in particular, to get it onto the pharmaceutical lists so the parents will only have to pay something in the order of $12, $14 or $16 per prescription rather than the $70 or $80 they are paying now. If this continues to be the case, many children, particularly those from poor families, will be denied the use of this drug that they should otherwise be entitled to. </PARA>

I have received letters from my constituents asking me, as a member of parliament, to do what I can to get this parliament to stop rugby league being taken over by a citizen of the United States. They reckon we are all a bit wimpish because we will not do it. While I agree with those sentiments, I have to say that the credibility of the Australian Rugby League is also under question. I was concerned back in the late seventies and the early eighties about the integrity of the game. I believe there was corruption in the game at the time. I believed it had been cleaned up in 1983 as a result of a well-known television program. But more recently there has been a bit of a cloud over the game. That could not be exemplified in a more blatant fashion than the selection of the World Cup team last night, where a number of unarguably the best players were left out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the best Australian team not include players like Laurie Daley, Ricky Stuart, Bradley Clyde, Brett Mullins, Steve Renouf, Steve Walters and so on?

As far as I am concerned, whatever credibility was left in the game until yesterday is gone if that is the best Australian side that can be chosen when all players have been considered on their merits. I think it is a disgrace. The sooner this wrangle can be sorted out in the courts or wherever, the better it will be for all genuine sports loving Australians. I think it reflects very badly that we have a situation where the league is claiming they have picked the best players, yet the players with the calibre of those that I have mentioned and others have been left out of the side. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What he means, of course, is what any interested observer would call a `Clayton's test' in respect of no disadvantage. It would not protect Australian working men and women in terms of their conditions. It would not protect them in terms of some of those well-established and accepted standards that do apply across the community, such as sick leave. That is why on this side of the House we will not leave working Australians disadvantaged as the coalition would, seeing major reductions in income going to them from enterprise bargaining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I gave some examples in the House last week. I indicated that the Leader of the Opposition is on the record as supporting the Western Australian industrial relations legislation. Under that legislation there is no provision for overtime pay, penalty rates, or higher leave loadings; no compensation in the form of higher pay if these benefits are lost, and the wage paid will be of the order of $301 a week for adults for a 40-hour week&mdash;$15,000 for an adult person in this day and age under the Western Australian legislation, supported by the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me repeat a couple of the numbers I gave the House last week. A typical unskilled labourer working on average overtime of 10 hours a week would lose $4,888 per year&mdash;about 17 per cent. That is massively disadvantaging that group of people. A nurse who works 16 hours each weekend would have a pay reduction of about $115 a week, or $5,970 a year&mdash;a reduction of 38 per cent. The average full-time registered nurse today receives an additional 22 per cent in annual earnings just as a result of receiving penalties for night and weekend work. Of course, that would go. The same applies to the transport worker whom I mentioned last week who would lose $5,910 a year&mdash;a cut of 18 per cent a week. This disadvantages 360,000 drivers in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us again record that the opposition will seek to remove the no disadvantage test. Thus we can see reductions in the wages and terms and conditions of employment of Australian working men and women. Some of those well-established and accepted community standards such as sick leave would be abolished. By opposing this approach the government seeks to put in place, in a sense, the best of all worlds: that is, flexibility of enterprise but, at the same time, reasonable and genuine protection for Australian working people.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the stock of debt we have offshore we still have the seventh lowest short-term real interest rates in the industrialised world. I think that demonstrates the point. But there is another point about our debt. The opposition goes running around talking about the debt. Australia has always&mdash;when I say `always', for most of the postwar years bar maybe three or four years&mdash;run a current account deficit, mainly because we have a very large continent which will always require a lot of investment, and that investment, generally, will be more than the savings of a relatively small population of 18 million people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just a week ago a World Bank study said that Australians had the highest assets in the world because of the assets of the continent divided amongst 18 million people. The flip side of that is that there will always be a requirement on Australians to find more savings for the investments that can go into a continent of this size, be it in mining, agriculture, minerals processing, infrastructure or transport. We will always be requiring investment greater than our capacity to save.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our savings declined in the 1970s and the 1980s principally from the household sector, largely because of the corrosive effect of high inflation. Double digit inflation removes the propensity of many Australians to save. The period through the 1970s to the mid-1980s of high inflation had a very corrosive impact on the propensity of Australians to save. At the same time, the public sector had bids for savings. In the year when this government was elected to office Commonwealth outlays were 30.5 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, on a trend basis, they are around 24 per cent to 25 per cent of GDP&mdash;they are down by about six percentage points of GDP. So, with that big call by the public sector in the days of the last coalition government and by the erosion of the propensity to save during the period of the last coalition government, this put Australia hostage to a bigger reliance on overseas savings to fund our investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the fact that we now have an open economy and a higher level of profitability which will actually underpin a higher investment performance, it really means we have needed more money for investment simply because we have had more investment than we had during the coalition years of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there has been a requirement for more investment, hence more savings, yet there has been a falling away in household savings and there has been a bigger demand by the public sector. Both things this government has sought to correct with household savings through superannuation, by our measures to put a minimum of 15 per cent away for all Australians by the year 2002 and, in the public sector, by getting the budgets again back into surplus&mdash;bearing in mind that only a Labor government has ever had the Australian budget in the postwar years into surplus. We are back into surplus and we will be strongly in surplus for the balance of the 1990s.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;About one quarter of the Australian population is aged 18 years or less. Obviously, the vast majority of those young Australians reside with their parents in Australian families. It is important that the vast balance of Australian government policy goes towards the strengthening of those families and the position of those young Australians. Indeed, I recall hearing over the weekend the minister for employment, Mr Crean, speaking about government programs in employment, education and training, which go very much to the support of young Australians. Our health policies are also directed largely to the health and welfare of those Australians and also our policies in relation to the operation of the Australian legal system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal of the laws which impact directly on young Australians rest at the state level. Nonetheless, there are important Commonwealth laws and important Commonwealth initiatives which impact directly on the position of young Australians in relation to the law. For instance, reforms which are currently before the Senate, having already passed through the House of Representatives, dealing with changes to the Family Law Act reinforce even more strongly that the position of children is to be the paramount consideration in any breakdown of marriage, that the welfare of children and parents' ongoing responsibility to their children is to be a primary concern of all those involved in that system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally important&mdash;more important in my view&mdash;should be measures which prevent relationship breakdown and safeguard the position of children. That is why the government's Justice Statement has put so much focus on those areas of prevention, if you like. There has been a specific focus in the Justice Statement on young Australians. The statement supports the funding which already goes to a number of youth advocacy centres operating at the community level throughout Australia. In particular, I note that the statement supports the ongoing work of the national children's and youth law centre. This centre was under threat of closure, with its previous funding source coming to an end. The government has stepped into the breach and will allow that very valuable service to continue. In addition to funding that service, the government through the Justice Statement is also funding an additional placement in the range of community legal centres of specialist youth workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will also be working in my portfolio area in the next number of months to develop further responses in this area. I note, in particular, that the Australian Law Reform Commission has now begun work with a specific reference dealing with the position of children and the law. The aim of this reference is to make sure that the inter-relationship between young Australians in the legal system is a responsive one, that young Australians do enjoy their full rights before the law, and that their parents are also fully equipped to deal with and protect them in relation to the law. Together with a range of other government policies, this proves the government's intention to make sure that Australian families are structured and supported in such a way that they are able to continue to progress, notwithstanding the obvious pressures of modern life.</PARA>

They need a long performance to be taking the view that, particularly on the long end, lending in this country is going to be as inflation protected or as inflation proof as, say, lending in Germany or in other places.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question because it gives me an opportunity to comment on a number of misleading reports making international comparisons of pension systems in Australia and in other countries. Such comparisons often fail to take into account the specific structural features of retirement income provision in this country, which is based essentially on three legs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is a targeted public pension system delivered through the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The second leg is publicly mandated private savings through superannuation, which the government has given considerable emphasis to extending. The third leg is voluntary savings. In this country the main form that has taken is by people acquiring housing. Around 80 per cent of people going onto the old age pension own their own home outright, which is an extraordinarily high percentage by international standards; in fact, it is the highest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three basic components to our retirement income system. Some have tried to compare one component of it&mdash;that is, the targeted pension system&mdash;with other systems in other countries which are based on a contributory arrangement. That is obviously an absurd comparison to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at that component of the pension system which is directed at those in the greatest need and if you make adjustments for cost of living differences between countries, it turns out that we have one of the most generous pension systems in the world. The amount that is paid is 50 per cent higher than what is paid in Germany, 33 per cent higher than both the US and the UK, 17 per cent higher than Sweden and 12 per cent higher than France. This gives the lie to the claim that we have a peculiarly parsimonious age pension system or retirement income structure. We do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a system which is different. Unlike most developed countries, for a variety of reasons, we did not go down the route of a contributory system. When you look at the three components, there is no doubt that we have a retirement income system which is adequate in terms of providing a safety net. We have committed ourselves to maintaining it in real terms and improving it, unlike the coalition, which allowed it to erode both in real terms and as a proportion of average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly&mdash;the World Bank emphasised this point in a recent report on how different countries are coping with the old age crisis&mdash;we have a system which, because of its efficient targeting, will be sustainable in the long term in the context of a situation where we have a significantly ageing population. Within a few decades, we will have to deal with the situation where a significantly higher proportion of the population will be above pensionable age. On all those counts, there is no doubt that we are moving to a system which is both fiscally sustainable and provides a decent retirement income for Australian elderly people.</PARA>

I gave him, as I remember, the answer on the key point&mdash;that is, household disposable income has risen by 40 per cent since 1983. Household disposable income per capita has risen by 21 per cent since 1983. It is that increase in household income plus the support which comes to Australians, particularly in the bottom deciles of income through the other transfer payments&mdash;10 per cent of the budget outlays we pay to Australian families&mdash;which go by way of additional family payment to the basic family payment. Of course, there is support under such broad programs as Medicare, which are progressive in their impact. There is also the home child-care allowance, the generalised child-care rebate, fee relief and all the other elements, including Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of changes are the things which have made the difference in this country compared with some of the countries the honourable member mentions in his question&mdash;that is, in Australia, there has been a much greater level of support for those people on the bottom deciles of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I gave the points the American Labor secretary made recently when he said: `In the United States, we have had huge employment growth but we have had falling real incomes.' He said, `By contrast, in western Europe they have had rising real incomes but lousy rates of employment.' Whereas, in this country, we have had the best of both worlds&mdash;rising employment and good growth in real incomes. Part of the good growth in real incomes is coming off the low inflation. If you look at the average weekly earnings growth at the moment juxtaposed against inflation, you will see real-term increases of substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It becomes a joke that members of the opposition think they can ask questions in parliament about people on low incomes as though they ever cared for them. The Leader of the Opposition has opposed every wage increase since 1978 bar one. Here you are now trying to knock off the no disadvantage test so you can claw the heart out of bottom end incomes. I suppose on the coffee shop circuit on Saturday you will say, `Good question there. Give it to them up there.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It just demonstrates the point that the people opposite have never cared about low income people. They have never cared about social justice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member, the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, for his question. It is a matter of disappointment to the government that the International Court of Justice ruled against New Zealand in its attempt to revive its 1973 nuclear test case. I point out to the House that this decision was not a decision which ruled on the merits of the case. It was made entirely on procedural grounds because the 1973 case was concerned with nuclear testing by France in the atmosphere it could not apply to the kind of test which France is now conducting&mdash;that is, underground testing. It made no substantive decision on the legality of nuclear tests and therefore gives France no warrant for claiming that it is justified in legal terms to go ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the court expressly stated that its decision about the obligation of the states to respect and protect the natural environment was without prejudice. It noted that both New Zealand and France had reiterated their obligations to that effect in the course of the proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that both Australia and New Zealand acknowledged from the outset that these proceedings faced formidable procedural hurdles. As well as that, no new proceedings against France can be commenced because after the 1973 case it withdrew its recognition of the jurisdiction of the court so we could not raise any new cases. But by applying to intervene in support of the New Zealand case, during the proceedings Australia and four other Pacific countries&mdash;the Marshall Islands, the federated state of Micronesia, Samoa and the Solomon Islands&mdash;were able to demonstrate our commitment to opposing the resumption of nuclear tests in the region. We were able to put on the record our views on the important questions of international environmental responsibility which the New Zealand case raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will, of course, continue to do whatever it can do to apply pressure on the French government to reverse its decision to resume nuclear testing. As for Australia's 1973 case, which as you would remember, Mr Speaker, was brought by the Labor government and was successful in driving the French underground, our legal advice has been that there is no real prospect of success for any attempt by Australia to re-open that case. The court's decision confirms the legal advice we have had to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To answer the second part of the honourable member's question, the government has also given careful consideration as to whether Australia could now commence new legal proceedings against France on any other basis, particularly, for example, under conventions which are aimed at the protection of the environment. Again, the clear legal advice we have had is that it is not possible to take action against France in the ICJ or before any other judicial or arbitral body without its consent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From now on, our focus in the ICJ will be on mounting oral argument on another nuclear test issue which is forthcoming&mdash;that is, the hearing of the advisory opinions which are being sought by the WHO and the UN General Assembly on the legality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.

What I said is this: the office of the DPP is of the view that there is sufficient evidence to establish that the four letters attempted to be tabled by Mr Aldred amount to forged documents within the meaning of section 63 of the Crimes Act 1914. However, the DPP is of the view that these documents are not forged Commonwealth documents within the meaning of the act in relation to the commission of a Commonwealth offence.

Mr Aldred's initial allegations made in this place on 5 June received widespread coverage that damaged the reputations of the honourable member's constituent and Mr Costello. It is sad and unfortunate that that occurred. Mr Costello and Mr Leibler suffered hurt on the basis of forged documents full of fabrications.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer to the standard of government administration and leadership and the public attitude to our democratic institutions. One can listen to the government's daily menu during question time in the House. I noted today that there were three typical questions supposedly without notice&mdash;but of course on notice&mdash;from government members to ministers. The three questions related to pensions, health and law. As I have said, this is part of the daily menu of government and part of what is really the government's administrative load.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also notice the difference between that and the big picture: the question of what the government is doing overall, what its major policies are doing to Australia, and how those policies can enable it to carry out its administrative load. I have no doubt that, as far as the public are concerned, the government is not governing according to the expectations of the electors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted the contradictions between ministers' statements and the response that they have received in the media. I read some references today in the amazing statement by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) last week concerning the non-connection&mdash;or lack of connection as he said then&mdash;between Australia's overseas debt, inflation growth and interest rates. In last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the Treasurer said that the increases that occurred last year in interest rates had nothing whatever to do with foreign debt. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have, therefore, a level of mortgage rates which are set off official interest rates and have no connection whatever with the level of foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA>I think most people on this side of the House shook their heads in amazement that the Treasurer could make such a definite statement when, of course, he is obviously wrong. The error of his pronouncement was illustrated in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> under the heading `Adviser lashes Keating on debt'. The article refers to the view of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on this question. The commentator, Mr Alan Wood, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drawing on work by two Reserve Bank researchers, Gregory delivers the unpalatable message that if the Government tries to push the economy along at the 3.5 to 4.0 per cent rate forecast in the Budget, it will face a falling exchange rate, rising inflation and rising foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a view that is in direct contradiction to the official view now adopted by the government. There was a reference in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> to Mr Vince FitzGerald who, in his own article, answered the criticism of his view of the connection between the debt and economic factors within Australia. Mr FitzGerald wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government net debt to all other sectors, including amounts legally owing to its employees for past service, is well over $200 million.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say, however:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Commonwealth debt accumulated over the past two decades, due to the Commonwealth consistently spending more on current consumption than it raised in revenues.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he quite clearly indicates that the Commonwealth's internal borrowing in Australia has a direct relationship to the overseas debt as we now know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are further references in headlines such as `Deficit or jobs: It's our choice, says economist' and so on. This means that the government is in disarray. It could not be better illustrated than in an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> which is headed `Innovate or Evaporate'. It refers to the industry policy for innovation of the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook). The article begins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the planned cornerstones of the Keating Government's electoral recovery&mdash;its proposed innovations statements&mdash;has been savaged by the Labor Caucus as woefully inadequate, and its author, Industry Minister Peter Cook, told to go back and try again.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the government is not governing in the accepted sense of the expectations of Australians. The roll-up of this is that the government is standing still and day by day justifies its record, instead of going out and telling Australia its plan for Australians in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no point in the government continually saying to the opposition, `Bring out your policies.' The government has been in power for 12 years in Australia. It is Labor's record of government in Australia that I want to refer to now. I do so knowing that Australians generally have a very poor view of their politicians. There have been several polls of recent times and an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> which illustrate this point. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A massive 95% of respondents&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>referring to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> poll&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">say that MPs should stop arguing with each other and concentrate more on running the country.</PARA>
<PARA>But, worse&mdash;this is according to the polls&mdash;it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to voters, the quality of our federal MPs is much poorer today than two decades ago;</PARA>
<PARA>I do not agree with that poll. I believe that members of this parliament from both sides of this House are here with high motivations to serve Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Labor in government across Australia has given a clear picture of its record in the last 12 years; that means that these disillusioned voters will make a decision for perhaps the first time in those 12 years knowing fully what they can expect from the result of that vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look at Western Australia&mdash;a state government which blighted the future for years of that state with a patronage from government to selected individuals in industry and commerce, resulting in a fiasco, a loss of a great sum of money in petrochemicals and in the failed Rothwells bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Australia there was an enormous loss by South Australian standards, and by any government standards, of about $4 billion because of the defect of a Labor government's administration. In Victoria, there was a loss of similar dimensions&mdash;approximately $4 billion&mdash;through the failure of the Victorian State Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where were the regulators? Who was the chief regulator in Australia when these failures were occurring? It was, of course, the Treasurer of the federal government, now the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. He was the regulator of the financial institutions who could have and should have reined in those reckless state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, the federal government was up to its ears too in the entrepreneurial spirit of the 1970s. I remember in this House the passage of an amendment to the Australian securities legislation to assist Mr Robert Holmes a Court to take over the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. It was a narrow run thing that that company was not acquired by Mr Holmes a Court, broken up into constituent parts and sold to owners around the world. If that had happened, this government in office would have been directly responsible for the bill that it passed in this House to assist a friend in the entrepreneurial area of Australian commerce and industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The picture is there for all Australians to see: three failed state Labor governments have been all replaced, a federal government which has run out of reform and a federal government, once we have got through the entrepreneurial activity in Australia which led directly into a recession, that has no further ideas to sustain the Australian economy. This government borrows heavily internally, affecting the overseas borrowing and reducing the initiatives that are available to any government to manipulate, for the benefit of Australia, the growth factors in this country: employment, interest rates and the value of our dollar on the world market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These facts are clear for Australians to see. The dissatisfaction which the general public has with politicians in general will be transferred into a significant roll of the democratic wheel at the next federal election when this government will be soundly defeated. One can find the inevitability in the community and the atmospherics in the community&mdash;the forces which threw out the McMahon government will throw out the Keating government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this grievance debate I want to refer to the Working Nation program in two ways: firstly to commend and congratulate those firms, organisations and community groups that are participating in the Working Nation program and helping provide opportunities for unemployed Australians to re-enter the work force and, secondly, to encourage more businesses, local government organisations and community organisations to join the program and so further expand the range of opportunities for unemployed people to re-enter the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the Working Nation program what government is about is generating continued employment growth and seeking to involve all Australians in the economic recovery that is well under way. Where we have had growth in employment in the past, particularly back in the 1980s when the economy lifted and employment growth took place, most of that growth, most of those new jobs, went to new entrants to the work force. What we are trying to ensure through Working Nation is that those who have been unemployed are given priority in re-entering the work force. So those who have been unemployed 18 months or more are given special treatment to get them back into the work force, to give them current work experience and so enhance their chances of regaining an independent income and the dignity of having their own income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) launched Working Nation on 4 May 1994 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Success depends on all Australians joining the effort to tackle unemployment&mdash;from business, trade unions and communities and all tiers of government.</PARA>
<PARA>So Working Nation does address all Australians. What we are saying to young Australians is: if you are inexperienced we will see that you get the training you need to get into the work force. To those who are unemployed we are saying: if you do not have the appropriate skills we will help you get those skills. To business, we are saying: we are aiming to supply you with the people and the skills that you need&mdash;people who are well trained and ready to enter or to re-enter the work force. The expenditure of public money will be on programs that will improve community amenities generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the heading of the Working Nation program there has been the introduction of a national training wage, there have been increased resources for work experience and training programs and there has been the introduction of the job compact. This is a compact between government and a person who has been unemployed 18 months or more that they will be given the opportunity to re-enter the work force, that a place will be found for them at least for six months and, one would hope, longer than that so they can rejoin the payroll and update their experience and skills, so enhancing their chances of securing long-term employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have brought in new work opportunities, NWOs, and jobskills. Both of those programs are very active and are going well in my electorate. I will come to that later. One of the important aspects of Working Nation has been the introduction of case management so that the person who is seeking employment is able to deal with the same person. A manager is allocated to that unemployed person to assist and guide that person to regain employment. In the past, each time somebody went into the CES or went to make an inquiry the odds were that they would find a different person dealing with their problems. There was a lack of continuity and what came about was frustration and certainly a high degree of inefficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been changes to Department of Social Security programs to assist people to get back into the work force and to support them whilst they are out of the work force. One might ask: how much is it all costing? The allocation over four years is $9,000 million. Of that, $2.2 billion is being spent in this financial year, 1995-96, and $2.3 billion in the following year, 1996-97. This is the largest amount of money and the strongest attack that has ever been made on unemployment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the problems abroad. No Western economy has been able to address the question of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, in the manner in which Australia is addressing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people here may make complaints. Some may say, `You should be doing more', but no country in the Western world is having the success in addressing the problems of the long-term unemployed that we are having. Others might say, `Well, you aren't doing enough.' Any person unemployed is one person too many unemployed. But there is a limit to how fast we can move through this program, and it is a limit that is in some ways decided by the level at which business, community groups and local government organisations are prepared to participate in the program. No other country provides a job for every person who has been unemployed for 18 months or more, and no other country in the Western world provides one-to-one case management as we in this nation are providing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Working Nation began over a year ago, much progress has been made. The number of young people looking for work is down by 14 per cent; the total number of unemployed is down by 14 per cent. I do not mean that the rate is down by 14 per cent, but that the number of people who are unemployed is down by 14 per cent. The number of 15-year-old long-term unemployed people is down by more than 20 per cent. The number of 20- to 24-year-old people who have been long-term unemployed is down by over 30 per cent. In the last financial year over 400,000 unemployed persons entered case management. Of those, 110,000 obtained work, many in unsubsidised employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, Working Nation is working. It is stimulating growth, it is raising the level of domestic savings, it is improving infrastructure and, most importantly of all, it is giving back to hundreds of thousands of Australians the dignity, independence and freedom that comes with being in employment, that comes with having a job and that comes with earning one's own income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate, the Working Nation programs have been very successful for the community, for the long-term unemployed and for local businesses, firms and community organisations. In the Toukley area, the Chamber of Commerce, in association with the CES, has developed a main street program. It is an excellent program, aimed at beautifying the main street and at providing skills in paving, planning and painting for the long-term unemployed. It is also aimed at strengthening that old type of local shopping centre, the main street, for people who have some difficulty coping with the big shopping centres. Here we have a wonderful combination of providing opportunities for unemployed persons to regain skills, to get them back into the work force, and also enhancing the environment of the local shopping centre, giving it and its business people a better chance of coping with the pressure that comes from the big shopping centres. It is helping to stimulate local business, and it will help put pride back into Toukley as a shopping area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A little to the north, right on the coastline, on Birdie Beach there is a dune stabilisation program going on as a new work opportunity program. Under that project, the sand dunes are being shaped and re-stabilised, native vegetation is being preserved and the planting of trees is taking place. The dunes are being fenced, and the building of those fences is part of the program. Better community access and better national park qualities are being provided in that coastal area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving to the northern part of my electorate, to the Lake Macquarie City Council area, a bicycle track is being built virtually right around the northern half of Lake Macquarie, running from Speers Point all the way around to Blacksmiths in the south. Last Friday morning we opened stage one of that project. Ten of 11 people there had been long-term unemployed, and they graduated with certificates. One could only be proud of the quality of work that they had completed on this cyclepath. One man I met there had been unemployed for four years, and one could see the difference it made for him to be back at work, even if it had been for only six months. For him to have a pay envelope for six months, to update his skills and to get his dignity and independence back, made it well worth doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment and training skills were provided for those people; the community has gained an excellent cyclepath; the participants have gained pathway construction and measuring skills, first aid skills, traffic control procedure skills and personal development. They have been provided with current experience, and we have enhanced their opportunities and prospects of gaining employment. So, overall, Working Nation is producing results in the electorate of Shortland. We want to see more participation from more business people and more community groups. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems that home owners in the Geelong region know more about economics than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other so-called experts do. While the Prime Minister is saying that things `are as good as they get', the World Bank is telling Australians they are the wealthiest people in the word. However, home owners in Geelong could be forgiven for not feeling particularly wealthy in the last few years. The seat of Corangamite has one of the highest proportions of home ownership in Australia: 77 per cent of dwellings are owned by the occupier, compared with the national average of 67 per cent. There is concern amongst these home owners that, while mortgage rates have risen in the last 12 months, the value of their homes has hardly risen at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent World Bank study which placed Australia at the top of the international wealth table is based on the value of unrealised assets, which are in the ground or exist in theory only. Much of that wealth is beneath Mount Isa or Olympic Dam, and is of no tangible benefit to individual Australians. Some of it is beneath North Ranger or in the south-east forests, which government laws prevent any Australians from realising. As anyone struggling with a family budget could tell you, these theoretical assets in the ground will not pay for the mortgage, food, gas or electricity. They know that their wealth can be judged only by real assets. The family home is the most obvious tangible piece of wealth for most Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the World Bank believes that the typical Australian lives in a cave of jewels, but the reality is that most Australians are not seeing their most fundamental asset rise in value. Owning the family home is the great Australian dream, something Australians have always strived to pay off and own outright after a lifetime of hard work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Residents in Belmont, Highton, Grovedale and the Bellarine Peninsula have been paying more and more on that investment in monthly mortgage repayments in the last 12 months, while the value of this asset has remained static. They find it hard to believe the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Willis), who say that high mortgage rates in Australia have nothing to do with the $180 billion net foreign debt problem. If that is the case, why then are Australian home owners faced with higher mortgage rates than those in America, Britain, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, France and Japan? Even Dr Vince FitzGerald, who was the government's own adviser on national savings, is reported in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> to have refuted this claim. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The level of our foreign debt, our current account deficit and the financial behaviour of domestic sectors contributing to it&mdash;especially government&mdash;are in turn key factors in the foreign lenders' calculus about the quality of Australian debt. The resulting risk premium they demand is priced into the whole structure of Australian interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr FitzGerald, an authority on national savings policy and the government's own savings expert, refutes the Treasurer's claim that foreign debt has nothing to do with interest rates in Australia. Under the current Labor government, net foreign debt has risen from $23 billion in 1983 to the current $180 billion. This year, Australia's record $27 billion current account deficit will simply add to this figure. This has put pressure on interest rates. Since August last year the Reserve Bank has raised official interest rates three times by a combined total of 2.75 per cent. This has fed through to housing interest rates, meaning home buyers in the Geelong area will pay more each month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, at the National Australia Bank in High Street in Belmont, the flexible home rate now stands at 10.55 per cent with the alternative rate fixed at 7.9 per cent for one year or 8.95 for two years. At the ANZ Bank in Belmont, the variable rate is 10.5 per cent with fixed rates ranging from 8.95 for one year up to 9.9 for five years. However, while home buyers in Geelong have faced rising home loan rates, the value of their investment has not kept pace with inflation over the last three or four years. According to the Valuer-General, in Geelong in 1990 the median house prices in the city of South Barwon, incorporating Belmont, Highton and Grovedale, was $113,000. By 1992, the median price had fallen to $106,000. Similarly, in the Shire of Bellarine, including areas of Port Arlington and the new housing developments in Drysdale and Clifton Springs, the 1990 median price was $103,000. By 1992, it had fallen to $97,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the amalgamation of local governments in Victoria, the Valuer-General's figures are available only for the City of Greater Geelong as a whole. However, those figures show that right across the Geelong region the median house price remained stagnant at $94,500 between 1993 and 1994. Over the same period local house prices either fell or remained stagnant. The consumer price index rose by four per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So while home owners are giving more and more of their pay packets to pay off their homes, their house values have not even kept pace with inflation. We are now faced with the very real prospect of negative equity where home owners owe more on their homes than the house is worth. This negative equity problem has been particularly acute in Britain where an estimated five per cent of houses are worth less than the combined mortgage repayment bill on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the UK several families and young couples have sold their houses only to find that the sale price will not cover the outstanding debt to the bank on the property. The root of the problem in the UK has been the twin causes of rising interest rates and stagnant house prices. The result has been a series of stunning by-election defeats for the ruling British Conservative Party. Although this situation is yet to become widespread in Australia, it is something which could happen soon given the current conditions. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> two months ago ran a story on the prospect of negative equity sweeping through parts of Australian suburbia. This is the situation in Geelong and the Bellarine Peninsula. Home rates have risen, house prices are stagnant, and young couples have the majority of their loan still to repay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is worsened because many home buyers start off at a lower interest rate fixed for a year or even up to five years. This makes sense for those who have a number of up-front costs such as furniture and other things associated with starting out in a new home in a new area. However, by the end of the period in which the concessional fixed rate applies, the home owners have paid off very little of the principal of their loan. They will have paid off some interest on their loan but the amount of debt they owe is often as high or higher after the initial period. They will face the prospect of higher home loan rates which could go even higher if the current account deficit and foreign debt continue to spiral out of control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Home owners in Belmont, Highton, Grovedale and the townships of the Bellarine Peninsula can be forgiven for thinking that they are not as wealthy as the World Bank believes them to be. They should also take issue with the Prime Minister's notion that things `are as good as they get'. They might also wonder why they pay so much more than home owners in most other Western nations. </PARA>

The Lebanese government had arranged for a week called Lebanon-Australia week to occur at that time. Honourable members may not be aware that Lebanon, as a country, has quite a small population&mdash;around 3 1/2 million people. But there may be as many as eight million to 10 million people of Lebanese descent living outside Lebanon. Although Australia is not the major place of residence for Lebanese who have emigrated, we are a major location for Lebanese migrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lebanon-Australia week was designed to help foster good relations between our two countries and to help improve the understanding of the circumstances of Lebanon. It was a great success. Lebanon is a very small country geographically and a very interesting country in terms of its actual strategic position in the Middle East. It is an area that has gone through a severe civil war. Some 17 years of civil war occurred there. The fighting was widespread and quite vicious. It is now just a couple of years since that war officially ended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that I was particularly impressed by upon my arrival and travels in Lebanon is the relative safety that now exists within Lebanon. Sporadic acts of violence still occur, as they occur in all countries of the world, but members of the delegation were able to travel around at all times of the day or night feeling safe and were free to travel where they wished to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing I was impressed by was the friendliness of the people. The Lebanese people were extremely friendly to the members of the delegation. We were treated extremely well throughout our time there. The development that is occurring in Lebanon also deserves comment. After so many years of war, the fact is that most of the basic infrastructure of the country has been destroyed. There was widespread devastation, particularly in central Beirut, which had to be acted upon by the Lebanese government and people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have embarked on an impressive program of development in order to correct those difficulties. We were able to tour the sites of some of the development, particularly in the central area of Beirut, undertaken through a consortium entitled Solidaire, which is looking to rebuild central Beirut. An interesting aside is that, when they were removing the remains of some of the devastation they found significant Venetian ruins under the main streets. They are now endeavouring to rehabilitate those ruins into a major tourist attraction as a result of what they have found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major development is occurring. Another comment about Lebanon concerns its traffic problems. As I said, Lebanon has a population of around 3 1/2 million people but over 1.25 million cars. Travelling around by car is seen in the current circumstances to be a sign of freedom. The fact is that you do not tend to travel very far very fast, because the traffic problems are quite horrific. But new works are going on into roads, electricity and telecommunications. The work is quite significant and important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It brings me to the question of the potential of Lebanon as a country. Lebanon was known in the past before the civil war as the Switzerland of the Middle East. It was the commercial hub of the Middle East. Over 50 banks had their regional headquarters for the Middle East in Beirut. It was very much the commercial capital of the Middle East. Post war, attempts are being made to get that back on track. I wish the Lebanese people and the Lebanese government well in trying to deliver that. They have a major task ahead of them. Certainly on the evidence we saw while we were there, they are well on the way to rehabilitating the capital into a  major commercial centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of that area is a history of great trouble. It is also a history of great accomplishment. In our time in Lebanon, we toured a number of historical areas in Baalbek and the Bekaa Valley. We viewed Roman ruins and Venetian ruins throughout the country. We certainly got a sense that many had travelled there before us. The ability of the people to rehabilitate themselves over time after the struggles they have seen historically is quite significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to another issue, which is something I brought back from the trip. It relates to the question of, in media terms, the stereotyping of Arabic people through the media. It is a problem that many in this House suffer. We get stereotyped for our behaviour. It is often unjust, but sometimes just. But the fact is that it does occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any fair-minded observer, when examining both electronic and printed media reports in recent years, would certainly develop a very different view of the people of Arabic descent from those of us who deal with them. It has often been said to me when I have said I was going to Beirut that I should be careful and duck. I have been asked whether I am sure it is a wise thing to do. Others say things to the effect that there are a lot of terrorists there. Although, as I said earlier, there are problems in that part of the world, the fact is that the Arabic people we met there were very much cosmopolitan and modern in their outlook and ways. They were not riding camels and all wearing headdresses. We were not in situations, which you would see from the media, where there was a bomb behind every doorway or behind every cupboard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the weekend, I went to a seminar run by the South Eastern Arabic Community Association and the Australian Arabic Council, which is looking at the very issue of the stereotyping of Arabic peoples in the media. They raised some very pertinent examples of this occurring in the past. Members would remember the Oklahama bombing, which occurred not so long ago, and the initial stories that came out in the media at that time around the question of who may have been responsible. I know that the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, for example, did run in its stories&mdash;it was not alone&mdash;comments that the attack bore all the hallmarks of Middle East terrorism. Certainly a terrorist was one of the key prime suspects early on, but, when you went to the detail, there was no basis in fact for these allegations. As we all now know, it appears to have been done by an ex-marine all American boy. The matter is still before the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example that is closer to home is the Russell Street bombing that occurred in Melbourne some time ago. At the time of the attack, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> ran a story mentioning an Arab looking person being seen at the scene of the crime. Again, circumstances showed that it had nothing to do with anyone of Arabic descent. It had nothing to do with the Middle East or, for that matter, any organised group of terrorists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact I would like to impress upon the House is that, as we all know, not all Arabs are Muslims. There are Christians and many different religious denominations in Arabic communities. Not all Arabs are Muslims, not all Muslims are fundamentalists and not all fundamentalists are terrorists. That is a fact. The circumstances are clear for people to see once we get past the initial media reports. That is something that people need to keep in mind when they read them. It is fair to say that it is a form of persecution which occurs against the Arabic community through the mainstream media in terms of perceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank a range of people associated with the trip. I mentioned before Ghasssan Karaki and Karl Saleh. There is also Hussein Al-Hage and Hayssam Joumaa, who is the director general of the Department of the Emigrants. The others include Ghassan Nasser, Eddie Abdullah and Nabil Seif. I am running out of time and I cannot go through the rest of the names. All those involved can be assured that they have my thanks and the thanks of other members of the parliamentary delegation who were there in an unofficial capacity for the work they did in ensuring that the trip was a success. There were problems. There will always be problems in organising a group and an itinerary of the size that they did. All in all, it was a great success. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today in the grievance debate to bring to the notice of the parliament the Queensland Labor Party's approach to the Eastlink proposal. The Eastlink proposal is about the connection of Queensland to the east coast national power grid. It involves a connection from just near Gatton, which is west of Brisbane, across the southern Darling Downs through to Armidale. There have been very real concerns in the community about this proposal that has been put forward by the Goss Labor government in Queensland. Those concerns have been recognised by this side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, after the last state election, Premier Goss was almost in tears apologising to the people of Queensland. He said that in future he would consult with, and listen to, the people of Queensland. He said that he got the message at the state election that the people of Queensland were not happy with the manner in which he was governing Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we seen since the state election in Queensland from the Goss Labor government, which governs with a majority of one seat at this stage or 16 votes in a marginal seat that is now the subject of disputed returns? Mr McGrady, the minister responsible for the Eastlink proposal, has said that they will push through with the connection of the Eastlink proposal. He will not listen to the people of Queensland. He will not listen to the Senate inquiry that has been proposed by this side of the parliament. The inquiry will conduct public hearings in that part of Queensland which will be affected by Eastlink from the very first week of October. Mr McGrady has in fact said that the Senate inquiry is irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much for the Labor Party in Queensland learning something from the last state election. Mr McGrady is not going to listen to the people of Queensland on this issue. I wonder whether he is going to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Ms Crawford), the member for Forde, who is sitting opposite, who made a statement last week which ran in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> in Queensland. She is going to dissociate herself from the Labor Party on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go back to the Eastlink inquiry because it is of concern not only to members on this side of the House but also to members of my own electorate. They have very real concerns which have not been adequately addressed at any level. They have concerns about the effect this powerline will have on the health of the community. They do not believe that the environmental concerns have been adequately dealt with at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have concerns about the effect this powerline cutting across the southern Darling Downs will have on the growing tourist industry, particularly rural tourism. They have concerns as to the operation of the small farms in that part of Queensland and how they will be able to continue to operate with this massive power grid traversing the small farms on the southern Darling Downs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are not irresponsible people; these are very responsible people who have organised themselves and done a great deal of research with the limited resources they have. They want the government of Queensland, including Mr McGrady, to listen to the outcome of the Senate inquiry. This inquiry has already started to examine the impact the power grid will have on the community in terms of health and tourism, as well as the operation of agriculture in the southern Darling Downs and the Lockyer Valley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the Eastlink proposal, it is interesting to note that the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology has produced a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gas and electricity&mdash;combining efficiency and greenhouse</EMPHASIS>. It is a report that Mr McGrady should have heeded. I would like to quote from the committee's 1992 report because it is very important that its recommendations are on the record of this House. It looked at this very subject of a national power grid. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the Committee considers that the connection of Queensland to the integrated grid would be highly questionable due to the very significant costs of a link and the extent of energy losses which would be likely to occur. It recommends Queensland not be included in the initial assessment of possible grid extensions and until it could be demonstrated that their inclusion can be achieved economically. Queensland may well be the ideal place to concentrate on the introduction of new technologies . . . rather than extending power grids.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Senate was looking into this whole subject of extending a power grid on a national basis. It is now going to look into the implications of the Eastlink proposal in terms of the connection to a national power grid and look further beyond those recommendations as to the effect this proposition by the Queensland Labor government would have on the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on another issue relevant also to Eastlink. As I mentioned earlier, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> on the weekend an article relating to the member for Forde was titled `MP slams Eastlink'. The member opposite, the member for Forde, is a parliamentary secretary, an office holder, who is disagreeing with the Goss Labor government. I challenge you to take the issue up with Mr McGrady and the Labor Party in Queensland. I know you did not have a great deal of success when it came to the implementation by the Labor Party of the affirmative action policy. I hope you will have a bit more success on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Jenkins)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! The honourable member for Maranoa will address his remarks through the chair, not across the table. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the parliamentary secretary's publicity on this issue, it is a forerunner of what we are going to see a great deal more of.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to talk about something that is relevant to my electorate: petrol prices. Regional Australians seem to suffer more than the rest of Australia over prices generally and petrol prices in particular. Mysterious extra costs seem to appear under the heading of freight charges&mdash;on everything from the local bowser to the corner store.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in Cairns are quite justified in being flummoxed at the inexplicable and large differences between petrol prices in Cairns and Brisbane. If you travel outside Cairns, you will see that for some reason petrol prices are cheaper in places like Mossman, Port Douglas and Babinda than they are in Cairns. That is very hard to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prices Surveillance Authority does not include freight charges in its setting of the wholesale price in places like Cairns because it has a sea port. There are no freight charges. Weipa has a similar problem. Prices are much higher there than in Cairns, even though the tanker stops at Weipa first before travelling to other centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between Cairns and Brisbane is volume. There are fewer petrol stations in Brisbane for the number of users than there are in Cairns. Consequently, individual Brisbane retailers will pump a greater volume of petrol and can carry price cuts. Brisbane also has a very competitive market. As a retailer, you do not survive long in a place like Brisbane unless you run a very efficient business and are prepared to enter the local pricing wars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this type of atmosphere the large oil companies will support their retailers and the market by discounting and keeping their prices low. They do not have another option in the larger cities and do not have the competitive incentive in regional areas. Brisbane also has independent retailers that keep the major oil company run stations on their toes in terms of prices. In such a competitive market it is difficult for collusion between companies to occur on the whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Cairns there have been reports of collusion between petrol stations for price setting, which is illegal. This is unfortunately difficult to prove. I would ask any member of the public who has information on collusion and can provide evidence and statutory declarations to please provide that information to me so I can turn it over to the Prices Surveillance Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The large oil companies are unfortunately not willing to cut their costs in places like Cairns. They do not see any reason to. Retailers will set their prices as high as they can in these situations. They say that their margins are so small that they have to charge the maximum price the market will bear. There is no doubt that they do have a case. There has been considerable pressure put on petrol retailers in recent years. It is true to say that they have faced higher overheads and lesser margins. Although this may be true, I am sure that there are some retailers in Cairns who would not survive the competitive markets in the bigger cities because they are not running as efficiently as they perhaps could. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What can we do about prices in regional areas like Cairns? It is simply not fair and equitable to say to those who live in regional Australia that this is one of the consequences of living far away from the capital cities. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Ms Crawford), who is at the table, is responsible for the northern social justice strategy. A very important principle of that strategy is that people who live in remote areas should, if at all possible, have the same benefits as those people who live in the larger capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have kept the Prices Surveillance Authority apprised of the situation throughout Leichhardt, particularly in Cairns and Weipa. The authority's view is that there is little scope for them to become involved in the issue. Their position is that they have no control over the retail price and the wholesale price is worked out using overseas averages. It is set quite fairly and gives retailers room to discount, but the problem is that discounting is not happening in Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prices Surveillance Authority can become involved where there is collusion between organisations on what price is set. Anecdotally, there is no doubt that collusion between petrol stations over the setting of prices is happening in some places in Cairns. However, getting hard evidence on this is difficult and anecdotal evidence is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, my office recently had a call from a gentleman who spoke to someone behind a petrol station counter. He mentioned to the attendant that the price down the road was cheaper and the attendant remarked that this should not happen because the stations had an agreement. My office has tried to get a statutory declaration from the person outlining the full details, but so far has been unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Understandably people are reluctant to do what is seen as dobbing in a fellow member of the local community and innocent bystander, such as the station attendant. Unfortunately, the Prices Surveillance Authority cannot do its job without solid evidence. People with any evidence of collusion should contact the PSA or my office with that information. I am sure that would apply for other members in other regional centres. Another view often put is that there appears to be a lack of competition in Cairns simply because there are too many petrol stations for the market. I am not sure whether that is true but that is certainly a view that has been put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in Mildura a successful scheme was set up to introduce competition into the market. The local RACV, with the help of the local paper, published daily the three cheapest petrol stations in town in a small box on the front page. This of course drew a lot of interest from the locals. People began buying the paper for the prices alone and were willing to switch their allegiances from station to station even for a small price difference. After a while, queues actually began to form at stations that had cheaper petrol. What began to happen was that there was a change in volume output of the stations pricing their petrol cheaper so they were able to carry the initial price drop and sustain further discounting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The local paper had been publishing this price list consistently every day for a month when the petrol stations put up a concerted fight to stop the publication of prices. The stations were understandably worried but the paper continued this campaign for another month. After this time there was a permanent change in the market. Not only had competition been introduced and the opportunity for informal collusion broken but an independent station entered the market creating further competitive pressure. The oil companies were no longer able to be complacent about their pricing policies in regional Australia, and neither were the local operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to do something similar in Cairns. There are some drawbacks. I would need the assistance of the local media. Prices would have to be listed daily for the idea to work. This may not be a problem. I would also need an army of volunteers because Cairns is a bit bigger than Mildura. I will be calling for volunteers as well as contacting people to see whether I can set up something like this in Cairns. It will create quite a workload so I will also approach the RACQ for assistance. They have been publishing some petrol prices in their magazine, but it does not come out often enough to encourage a price drop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The oil companies have to take a lion's share of the responsibility for this situation. I believe the oil companies need to be shaken out of their complacency in Cairns, and this may only happen if the market in Cairns becomes more competitive and an independent moves in. Creating competition can be quite a hard game, particularly in regional centres such as Cairns. It certainly does not happen by itself, but creating the right prod is also difficult. Oil companies have to play a part. They have to&mdash;to use a colloquialism&mdash;give those petrol operators who are operating efficiently a fair go. Hopefully, if resources allow, the regular publication, either through the paper or on radio, will give the impetus some retailers and their suppliers need to consider the margins again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituents know that they will perhaps never get to the situation where they will pay the same prices as people in Brisbane pay. They want to be assured that the system is fair and equitable. They want to be assured that in a market the size of Cairns they are able to buy petrol at a fair price. It is something that we have to recognise as an essential component in the outgoings of families these days. In an area like Cairns people have to travel to take their children to school and sport and to get to work. It is important. We of course have to develop public transport, but the price of petrol is also important. I certainly hope that by taking this matter up in the grievance debate in this parliament today we can get a bit of fairness and equity in terms of petrol prices in my region. </PARA>

Mr Holmes is a marine engineer who was a member of the crew of the oil rig tender <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lady Kathleen</EMPHASIS>. On 21 July 1991, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lady Kathleen</EMPHASIS> was involved in an operation to prevent an oil tanker, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>, bound for Kwinana from the Arabian Gulf, from running aground on the Western Australian coast.</PARA></TALK.START>

In fact, it was generally agreed that the action taken by Mr Holmes and his colleagues aboard the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lady Kathleen</EMPHASIS> was directly responsible for preventing an environmental disaster occurring on the Western Australian coast which would also, incidentally, have severely affected Australia's cray fishing industry. Mr Holmes and his colleagues aboard the ship&mdash;there were 12 involved&mdash;received salvage awards for their efforts. My constituent received a gross award of $23,381 for the part he played in that rescue mission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will be aware, if they have followed this issue in the press, that the Australian Taxation Office held that these rewards or amounts were assessable income under section 26(e) of the legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Holmes and his 12 colleagues aboard the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lady Kathleen</EMPHASIS> received a considerable amount of recognition for the action that they took that day. Part of that recognition was a citation for bravery by the Governor-General for the part that they played in the rescue mission.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ship's company of "Lady Kathleen" maintained a calm and purposeful dedication to the operation and performed their dangerous tasks with courage and enterprise.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that Mr Holmes has certainly gone through the due process of the law, but it is now up to the Australian government to take action to make sure that the bravery these men exhibited is properly recognised. What the government is doing by failing to act to correct the situation is entirely penny pinching.

But where has she been, as the member for Fremantle&mdash;where most of the crew of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lady Kathleen</EMPHASIS> at the time now reside? The answer I am informed is that she has been almost invisible in coming forward to help and assist in having the law rectified to overcome this problem. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), another Western Australian member, appeared on the Ray Martin show and told Mr Holmes and his colleagues to go to the AAT. They did and they won. They have since lost in the Federal Court, but Mr Gear has now apparently declined to appear again on the Ray Martin show and has had nothing further to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a close look at the circumstances that existed at the time, and I believe there are certainly some extenuating ones which need to be taken into account. As the court has made a final determination on this matter, the government now has an opportunity to step in and rectify the situation in the favour of Mr Holmes and his colleagues. I observe, as I did earlier, that the amount of taxation involved is very small compared with the amount of money that the Commonwealth has saved as a result of these men's actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to point out that the crew involved had no knowledge of any salvage agreement having been signed between P&amp;O and United Salvage. A technical question formed part of the final determination in the court&mdash;that was, under what circumstances they were acting. They did not attempt the rescue mission on the basis that they would receive a reward. I believe they were motivated purely by desire to prevent an environmental disaster. In any case, it is quite clear that the actions of those involved were carried out quite voluntarily. When you read the citation, when you hear first-hand accounts of what happened that day off the coast of Western Australia, those involved certainly risked their lives in the rescue attempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of Mr Holmes, I have written to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and have asked him to look at this matter. I hope that he will be motivated by the case that I put on behalf of my constituent and his colleagues to change the law&mdash;if that is what is required&mdash;to ensure these men receive the full reward to which they are entitled for the actions they took back in 1991. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak to the Veterans' Affairs (1995-96 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. This bill contains amendments necessary to implement some elements of the budget package for the veterans' affairs portfolio. Complementary to a comprehensive program of events commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, this budget package responds to the health and housing needs of the ageing veteran community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends two acts administered by the veterans' affairs portfolio&mdash;namely, the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. For the most part, the amendments give legislative effect to the 1995-96 budget announcements. The major announcements were to extend defence service homes eligibility to full-time members of certain Second World War women's services; to allow the assignment of defence service homes eligibility to providers of retirement villages and granny flat accommodation; to set a minimum age requirement for the partner service pension; to extend income support supplement to war widows and widowers with pensioner partners; and to extend treatment eligibility for veterans suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As there is no central theme to the bill, I would like to provide a brief background on each of the major amendments. The main amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 are as follows. Housing assistance has been available under the  provisions of the act to certain men and women who have served Australia since 1918. As at June 1994, there were 107,124 persons in receipt of defence service homes assistance. Assistance includes housing loan interest subsidies, comprehensive home owner insurance cover and home contents insurance. The maximum loan available is $25,000, repayable over 25 years. Under an arrangement between the Commonwealth and Westpac Banking Corporation, the Commonwealth subsidises Westpac for low interest loans that it gives to eligible persons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main effect of this amendment is to extend defence service homes eligibility for women who during the Second World War were members of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women's Army Service or the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force; a member of the Australian Army Medical Women's Service, other than a member of the Australian Imperial Force; or a full-time paid member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) said in his speech, for 50 years now former members of the World War II women's services who did not actually serve overseas during war time have been excluded from home services benefits, in contrast with many of the male volunteers. This initiative redresses that situation and recognises the major contribution to the war effort made by thousands of female volunteers who joined the services on the same basis as their male counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, a conciliation conference was held before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission as a result of a complaint from a World War II ex-servicewoman representative. The parties agreed that the present position is an issue of indirect discrimination and should be resolved. This proposal redresses that situation and recognises the major contribution to the war effort made by thousands of female volunteers who served the services during World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the proposed amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 deal with the assignment of the DSH eligibility to provide retirement village accommodation and granny flat accommodation. The key amendments proposed give the secretary to the department power to give permission to eligible persons to give their DSH eligibility to another person. Permission which takes the form of the issue of a certificate of assignment will be given only where certain conditions are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 1 extends the proposed amendment right to widows and widowers. It also extends the proposed assignment right to loans for essential repairs. The rationale behind the amendment is that, as the veteran population ages, their housing needs change and retirement village or granny flat accommodation are appropriate for many who have difficulty living alone independently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These arrangements will increase appropriate housing options and assist elderly clients to remain independently housed while encouraging them to move to accommodation more appropriate to their needs. As veterans age, existing accommodation may become inappropriate, and where this occurs, and particularly where social isolation is also a factor, there is often increased demand for nursing and caring services that might be more effectively met in terms of cost and health outcomes in more appropriate accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 are as follows. Firstly, there is an extension of pension eligibility to persons who performed continuous full-time service in Japan between 28 April 1952 and 19 April 1956. The government's intention with this amendment is to make eligible for a pension persons who were allotted for duty in Korea during the Korean war but who served only in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there will be a minimum age for partner service pension. The Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 allows a partner of a veteran to receive a partner service pension where they are married to or in a marriage-like relationship with a veteran receiving an age or invalidity service pension. The main effect is to provide that a person is not eligible for partner service pension unless they have reached 50 years of age or have a dependent child when they make a claim for the pension. This exclusion will not apply in two circumstances, namely, to a claim made before 1 October 1995 by a person eligible for a partner service pension or to a claim by a person determined by the Repatriation Commission before 1 October 1995 to be eligible for a partner service pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale given for the proposed extension is that it is generally accepted that people under 50 years of age should not be expected or encouraged to retire. Payment of partner service pension to younger partners does not encourage those people to seek work in their own right, and for many it is irrelevant as most partners today tend to be in the work force. Future non-veteran partners under 50 who are not looking after a dependent child or severely handicapped veteran and are unable to obtain work may be eligible for partner allowance, sickness allowance or disability support pension from the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next amendment is the extension of eligibility for partner service pension to certain non-veterans and widows and widowers. Eligibility for partner service pension will apply to those persons who are a member of a couple, whose partner is a veteran and who qualify for an age pension under the Social Security Act or who are a widow or widower of a veteran who has rendered qualifying service and who qualify for an age pension under the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently a partner of a veteran cannot apply for a partner service pension unless the veteran is receiving a service pension. Therefore, a partner who is of pension age and married to a veteran below pension age has to apply for a DSS pension and then transfer to a service pension later when the veteran becomes eligible. This initiative enables the Department of Veterans' Affairs to support a veteran's dependants even though the veteran does not receive a service pension or did not receive a service pension prior to his or her death. In addition, partners, widows and widowers may be entitled to receive a greater amount of pension than they would be entitled to from DSS because the DVA does not assess disability pension as income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, there is extension of income support supplement to war widows and widowers with pensioner partners. Basically, income support supplement is a payment in lieu of a social security payment, and to qualify a person must be a war widow or widower, an Australian resident and have reached retiring age, have a dependent child or be permanently incapacitated for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment extends eligibility for income support to war widows and widowers who have a partner getting a pension. The rationale for the extension of income support supplement is that the original intention of the income support supplement was to give all war widows and widowers receiving a social security income support pension the option of receiving their income support payment under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. However, not all social security pensioners fall within the existing eligibility criteria for the income support supplement. War widow and widower spouses of disability support pensioners and age pensioners are excluded. These amendments rectify this oversight. On equity grounds, war widow and widower spouses of service pensioners are also given eligibility for the supplement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final amendment is extension of treatment eligibility for veterans suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. Basically, to be eligible for treatment there has to be a determination in force providing that an injury suffered by a veteran is a war caused injury or that a disease contracted by a veteran is a war caused disease. Entitlement to treatment commences from the date the pension or increased pension is granted to a veteran for the injury or disease or, if the injury or disease is insufficient to grant eligibility for a pension or pension increase, the date the pension or pension increase would have been granted if the injury or disease was sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential features of post-traumatic stress disorder include rage, feelings of betrayal and guilt over having survived, confusion and memory problems, apathy, depression, anxiety, obsessive memories of combat experience, nightmares, insomnia, irritability and psychosomatic manifestations such as headaches, dizziness, stomach complaints, startle reactions, fear of losing control, panic attacks, emotional numbing and frequent denials of any problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the government initiated major extensions of treatment and support services for veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder around Australia. Many veterans have directly benefited from specialised in-patient services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal will assure the provision of appropriate early treatment to veterans for psychiatric problems brought on by post-traumatic stress disorder. Such early intervention in post-traumatic stress disorder cases greatly increases the likelihood of successful treatment outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst talking on the topic of veterans' affairs I thought it might be appropriate to take a moment to mention the importance of the Australia Remembers year and the way in which this has impacted upon my electorate of Lowe. `Australia Remembers 1945-1995' is the title of a year of commemorations which seeks to honour those Australian service men and women who died both during the war and in the intervening years, to thank those remaining service men and women for their efforts, to appreciate the sorrows and the difficulties of those who lost a loved one and to acknowledge the role played by those who worked on the home front in Australia during the war years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in my electorate of Lowe the Australia Remembers committee has played a key role in putting together and orchestrating a great program of events for the people of my area. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow Australia Remembers committee members for their fine effort. The committee consists of Mr John Lutman, the chairman; Mr John Murray MP; Mr Paul Zammit MP; Stephen Lesley; Alan Kinkade; Debbie Picone; Maurie Goldberg; Jack Hayes; Ross Brown; Bernard Falk; Frank Hayes; Karen Meadth; Ben Woolden; Ron Peak; and Russ Kenny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to mention the funding which was allocated by the Australia Remembers program to the following: World War II Veterans' Association launch; Concord Repatriation Hospital ball; Concord RSL fundraising ball; book of prose, poetry and performance program organised by Ms Joy Dempsey; Strathfield Municipal Council historical program; Burwood Oral Historical Group; Tarakan Memorial; Australia Remembers badges; Drummoyne RSL memorial refurbishment; school essay competitions; and Massey Park Ex-serviceman's Club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to especially mention an excellent book by Ms Olwyn Green of Drummoyne entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Name's Still Charlie</EMPHASIS>. This is a book about her husband. It has been a highly acclaimed book. I would highly recommend it to anyone who would like to relive those years; it certainly brings those war years alive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to refer in particular to the amounts given to the Concord Repatriation Hospital ball and also to the Concord RSL fundraising ball. The profits from those two balls went to the Anzac Health and Medical Research Foundation. I am very pleased to say that a grant has been given for a research institute in my electorate. I will just read part of this article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Con Sciacca, visited the Electorate recently to launch the capital appeal for the ANZAC Health &amp; Medical Research Foundation to be based at Concord Repatriation General Hospital.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Foundation will also have many benefits for Concord Hospital. Over the years, as a Repatriation Hospital, Concord Hospital's focus has been on service provision to the veteran community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike other major teaching hospitals Concord has not had a Research Institute. While valuable research has occurred at Concord in the past the strategic advantages of the hospital hosting a stand alone Research Centre are enormous.</PARA>
<PARA>I turn to make a few reflections on VP Day. I had the pleasure of attending a memorial service at Concord Hospital and later went to the wards and distributed the Australia Remembers certificates of appreciation. It stands out in my mind as one of the most moving days in public office. There were people who said to me that, for the first time in 50 years, they had actually begun to cry. It certainly was an opportunity for people to let out emotions that they had hitherto kept inside. When you asked where they served, the stories came tumbling out. You realise that these were ordinary Australians caught up in extraordinary times. I guess it is always ordinary Australians who are there to fight wars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the launching of a school kit at MLC we had the recollection of the diggers. One of them was talking about the night before they went into battle and saying that they were praying and that they were scared. As he described it, they were scared as hell that when the moment came they would not let their mates down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the beautiful things that I have been involved with on the Lowe Electorate Australia Remembers Committee has been the essay competitions where we have seen young people, who really did not have experiences of this war, all of a sudden building bridges with an older generation and asking people for the stories of what their experiences were like. They certainly appreciated that the freedom that they now have is a result of the sacrifice that other people made. It is certainly very important to building those bridges between our generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Those veterans did not let us down. I often wonder, as a young person of my generation, whether we would be prepared to pay such a price. I remember saying this at a function of the veteran community in Drummoyne and some veterans called out from the hall, `Yes&mdash;yes, you would pay the price just as we did because you are Australians, just as we are.' There is always the belief that as Australians we are prepared to do the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have shed many a tear at many of the commemorative events but I also have a new-found and deeper admiration for many of the older Australians, especially our veterans. They fought to protect us not only for democracy&mdash;these are not just words&mdash;but also for a way of life. I express the gratitude of a whole nation for remembering the end of the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Rocher)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! Before I call the honourable member for McPherson, I would like to say I was enthralled by the comments of the honourable member for Lowe. It would have been more than churlish of me to interrupt. The government does have a motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> that the House take note of the minister's statement on the Australia Remembers program. The only reason I mention it now is that this debate might stray into that area, whereas it is dealing with specific legislation.

I was thinking of taking a point of order but, for the same reasons, would not have wished to interrupt the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson), as I am sure she was absolutely genuine in what she said. I recall that, in a previous debate on veterans' affairs a few weeks ago, many of us took licence and the debate did stray so far from the bill that it did go down the track of talking about Australia Remembers. I was one of the members who took advantage of that, so it would have been even more churlish of me to take a point of order on the member. There is a motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> to take note of the minister's statement on the Australia Remembers program.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member in her remarks&mdash;having been kind, perhaps I could be slightly unkind&mdash;read a speech. I am not quite sure where she was given it to read from; I assume from the minister's office. I do not want to cast great aspersions on her, but she was obviously swallowing the propaganda that is often put to us by the government on these sorts of issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Lowe talked about initiatives and extensions in the context of a bill dealing with veterans' affairs. That may be the rhetoric, but in practice that is not actually what we are talking about here. Taking the Veterans' Affairs (1995-96 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill in its entirety, we are not talking about the extension of benefits to veterans; we are actually talking about a reduction of benefits to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not have to look past the financial impact of this legislation to see that that is the case. In total, there are 14 items listed in the financial impact statement accompanying this legislation. Of these, four have no financial impact, five will cost additional money and five will result in savings. Overall, the measures result in the following savings: in 1995-96, $3.4 million; in 1996-97, virtually $6 million; in 1997-98, $7.4 million; and in 1998-99, $8.7 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net effect of this legislation is that it takes away benefits from veterans; it reduces their current entitlements&mdash;you cannot obfuscate that. Even if you do want to trot out the government propaganda on this legislation and talk about initiatives and extensions, that is not the case. Those savings mostly come from the one element which the member referred to&mdash;where she again used the phrase `an extension of benefits'&mdash;and that is the changing of the minimum age for non-veteran partner service pensions. I regard that change as a direct attack on the veteran community. It is penny-pinching in the extreme. The reason it was introduced was to stop World War II veterans taking young Asian brides. There is nothing racist intended in that comment, as people who are aware of the situation would understand, but that was the point of that change, as I understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is not in the House today. He very often is in the House when veterans' affairs matters are debated. I do not question his whereabouts. I only make the observation that he normally comes in. I assume that he is otherwise engaged, which I perfectly understand, but I hope that somebody from the government side, and hopefully the minister when he sums up, will refute that suggestion in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to hear an argument&mdash;not a trotting out of the propaganda or a talk about other issues&mdash;that this has not been introduced for that reason. If that is the reason the government is supporting this legislation, as I suspect it is, then I want to ask the parliament and the minister whether they have questioned the effect this will have on the vast majority of veterans who will be adversely affected by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Setting at 50 years the minimum age requirement for partner service pensions for partners without dependent children saves the government a few million dollars, but it impacts severely on those many veterans with younger wives. Most of those&mdash;almost by definition&mdash;are not aged World War II veterans. You could count on a couple of hands those who do marry younger brides for one reason or another. Affected by this will be mostly Vietnam veterans, particularly the Vietnam veterans who have emotional or cardiorespiratory impairments where it is desirable&mdash;as it probably will be in every case&mdash;to have a wife acting as a carer at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this bill not only represents an attack on veterans, and Vietnam veterans in particular, but also represents an attack on those who care for them and need to care for them. Caring is a very emotive situation. The member for Lowe and the government have made the point that this initiative is to encourage those younger women to get back into the work force. Of course, many of them can choose, and they do choose, to do that&mdash;that is their right, and that can be encouraged&mdash;but this proposal will deny those veterans not on the special rate the care they need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that the government under pressure backed down in respect of some veterans&mdash;the member in her speech alluded to some of those areas&mdash;and certainly in respect of those on the special rate. But what about those, I ask the minister, on the 100 per cent rate who are unemployable and others who need to have a carer at home? Their interests are being severely downgraded. I am assured, from talking to some of my friends in the Vietnam veteran community, that they regard this also as an attack on their existing entitlements. There can be no argument that it is other than that, because of the savings that are going to result for the government from this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument may well be&mdash;let me anticipate government members who may come in here to argue the pros of this bill; perhaps the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) will&mdash;that this will more or less bring Vietnam veterans into line with social security beneficiaries. That also is objectionable in principle to the veteran community. Veterans deserve special treatment, not for any other reason than that they have earned that special treatment. It is something they are entitled to. Any attempt to downgrade the special treatment of Vietnam veterans, take it away from them, diminish it and put them in the same category as all other people is to downgrade their entitlements, which they have earned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of entitlements to veterans or their carers are not handouts but things they have earned. The wives who are involved, particularly if they are taking care of a veteran, are also entitled to have that opportunity. It is a shared responsibility that they have. The veteran lives through the effects, but so do the carers and spouses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very disappointed that the government has taken this action at this particular time. The member for Lowe who spoke before me mentioned Australia Remembers. It has been a great year. We have all talked about the many wonderful things that have happened. It is unfortunate that this measure should be enacted in this year of Australia Remembers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of this bill, let me place on notice for the minister some concerns that are being expressed in the veteran community about the 1994 changes to the act. There is an increasing concern that veterans' conditions have in practice been considerably diminished by virtue of that legislation. The legislation established the Repatriation Medical Authority, and we debated that at length at that time. It was the government's response, on second or third try, as I recall, to the Bushell decision, which was at the time very generous to veterans. There was concern&mdash;misplaced as it turned out to be&mdash;that this was going to cost billions of dollars. It was accepted by the RSL at that time, but I do not know exactly why. I have heard some suggestions as to why that might have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterans, the system having been put in place, are now coming to realise the full implications of this change. I want to ask the minister&mdash;he has responded frequently to the remarks I have made in the House by writing to me, and I respect him for the way that he does his job&mdash;when the promised review of the working of the new RMA is to happen. Veterans are starting to ask that. A review is part of the process. We are not sure whether that review is to take place on the anniversary of the passing of the legislation or at what point that review will take place, but veterans are certainly looking forward to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the benefit of doubt which had been enjoyed by the veteran community has, in practice, now been undermined to some extent. The RMA is effectively now judge and jury, and it seems to many veterans that the weight of medical and scientific evidence is now the standard of proof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is concern amongst veterans over the effective treatment of those with motor neuron disease. I bring this issue to the minister's attention. Motor neuron disease is a name given to a group of diseases, each sharing several commonalities. Statistically, MND affects about one person in every 100,000. It generally occurs in those people over the age of 50. The most preponderant form of MND witnesses a slow degeneration in muscles, with an average of about eight to 10 years from diagnosis to death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Out of the approximately 50,000 Vietnam veterans, one would statistically expect only one case of MND. Statistically, any more than two cases of MND in the entire Vietnam veteran population is beyond a chance event and points to a threat to the popularly held genetic hypothesis. More than three cases being found would also allow scientists to link the disease to a special causative agent, so reinforcing the weight of environmental hypotheses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, nine Vietnam veterans have been diagnosed with MND. Clearly, the fact that nine cases of MND have been diagnosed upsets the relevance of the currently popular genetic hypothesis. It also warrants a major investigation. The fact that so many Vietnam veterans have MND, and the SOP shows no linkage to service, undermines the validity of the current process. I make those remarks because in the context of this debate&mdash;and bearing in mind your earlier admonition, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;I want to take the opportunity to ask the minister specifically about that issue. A number of veterans have put to me a concern about how the current system treats motor neuron disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say this lightly, but I am concerned that the last couple of years have seen consistent downgrading of benefits to veterans. That is the debit side. In fact, I do not think there is any real evidence that there is a great credit side, but perhaps we will hear some cogent arguments from government members when they get up to speak on this issue. I hope that a coalition government, elected shortly, will reverse this&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one thing upon which I will agree with the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) and that is that veterans in our community are entitled to extra benefits and extra consideration because of the service that they have performed for their country. As the child, grandchild and son-in-law of veterans who served in the Second World War&mdash;and many other of my relatives served in the Second World War, the Korean War and a couple in the Vietnam War&mdash;I believe that it is the government's policy and philosophy to provide as many benefits as possible to the veteran community in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where I disagree most strongly with the member for McPherson is in his assertion that we are continually diminishing the benefits that we provide to veterans. I believe that that can be very strongly contested. As the member for McPherson has recognised, our current Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) has been doing an outstanding job in his portfolio, and that has been recognised across the community. I understand that in very recent days he has been recognised for his contribution by the RSL organisation nationally which has granted him the distinctive honour of life membership. I do not think that organisation has ever previously given that honour to a minister&mdash;particularly a Labor Minister for Veterans' Affairs. That speaks volumes for the contribution that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has made to the welfare of veterans throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995&mdash;the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War and the year of Australia Remembers&mdash;I believe that we are honouring that memory with additional benefits to veterans. There is one very important part of the Veterans' Affairs (1995-96 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 that the member for McPherson failed to recognise as a positive benefit. I refer to the amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act. I will deal with that matter shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other things that the minister has done this year which give due recognition to the important place that veterans have in our society and the honour that they deserve for the work that they have done for our community. One of those has been in the area of the aged care policy. The minister outlined previously in the House the policy that he had earlier announced called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">As time goes by: Continuing the commitment</EMPHASIS>. That was the policy statement on aged care which sets out future directions for care of the veteran community in the next five to 10 years. That policy has been drawn up in consultation with the veteran community across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through that policy program the government is introducing a five-year program to assist ex-service organisations to upgrade, replace or relocate their aged care facilities. It will be complemented by a four-year community care seeding grants program to improve the range and availability of community services in areas of demonstrated need where there is a high veteran population. That is just one initiative that the minister has taken which is a positive improvement in services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major initiative increases funding for research targeted to the health needs of the veteran community. A number of priority research areas will be identified each year to maintain the focus on veteran related issues. These arrangements will ensure that the health areas of most concern to veterans can be researched by the best scientists. That is a very important initiative because our veteran community has a number of specific health needs that require intensive research and analysis. This government is demonstrating its commitment to fulfilling that need by this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another very important initiative which the government recently announced is the improvement in the payment of nursing home costs for former Australian prisoners of war; improved access to chiropractic and osteopathic services for entitled veterans, war widows and war widowers; and simplification of the delivery of health care by halving the different types of treatment entitlement cards. I would like to particularly comment on the expansion of the nursing home costs for former Australian prisoners of war because that is a very important additional initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was impressed by the arguments of a former member of this place, Mr Tom Uren, when he sought to have some improvements made to and recognition of the particular circumstances that prisoners of war had suffered in the war years. He pointed out that they were entitled to some additional benefits. I commend the government on this initiative of covering all the nursing home costs of Australian former prisoners of war. I am the grandchild of a former prisoner of war. My grandfather spent 3 1/2 years in Changi and on the Burma railway and suffered enormously as a result of this treatment. He is no longer with us. He certainly gave a great deal for his country. I believe that prisoners of war deserve special recognition and special consideration. They are getting it from this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that this government recognises the important place that veterans have in our society and that they get extra special treatment. It is something to which they are fully entitled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to comment on one of the very important initiatives in this legislation that the House is debating today, and that is the extension of the defence service homes eligibility to full-time members of certain Second World War women's services. For 50 years former members of the World War II women's services who did not actually serve overseas during wartime have been excluded from the defence service homes benefits in contrast to many of the male volunteers. This amendment redresses that situation and recognises the major contribution to the war effort that was made by thousands of female volunteers who joined the services on the same basis as their male counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of these female volunteers worked in circumstances which were in forces that acted in a military-like way and they were required to undertake certain duties that were similar to military type duties without, of course, facing direct threats in service. They provided an enormous array of services for Australia's war effort. This extension of the defence service homes eligibility will be an important additional benefit for them in recognition, in 1995, of the contribution that they have made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important change that has occurred is that we have extended the eligibility of defence service homes to providers of retirement village and granny flat accommodation. This will mean a major improvement for former veterans who are living in those forms of accommodation. As the Department of Veterans' Affairs review outlines, as the veteran population ages their housing needs change and retirement village and granny flat accommodation is now more appropriate for many who have difficulty in living alone independently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will increase appropriate housing options and assist elderly clients to remain independently housed by encouraging them to move to accommodation more appropriate to their needs. As veterans age, existing accommodation may become inappropriate. Where this occurs, and particularly where social isolation is also a factor, there is often an increased demand for nursing care and services that might be more effectively met in terms of costs and health outcomes in more appropriate accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the desire of the government to keep people independently housed for as long as possible. If that means that we need to provide additional financial assistance so that people can utilise other forms of accommodation such as granny flats, where they are living under or next to their families but still independent of their families&mdash;still having close access to their families&mdash;or if they are living in retirement village situations and are able to work in a group and have the comfort of knowing that they are in a group housing situation for their own support needs, we believe that should be encouraged. It is preferable to people being forced, because of their needs, to move into some form of institutional care such as a nursing home or hostel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this amendment to the legislation will facilitate greater independent living by those veterans who are in need of nursing care or support services but who do not wish to be institutionalised in a nursing home. So I commend those amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight we are considering a number of other amendments in the legislation, one of which extends income support supplement to war widows and widowers with pensioner partners. This, again, is a positive benefit which is not a reduction in the conditions applying to veterans, as the member for McPherson would have us believe. It is an improvement to the benefits available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that all of these amendments are worthy of support. They are not amendments that will in any way diminish the quality of care that this government provides to the veteran community. It is a reflection of the fact that this minister does have a strong commitment to the veteran community. That has been demonstrated throughout this year through the commemorations and celebrations that we have had all over Australia with the Australia Remembers program. It is to his credit that the minister continues to be an active voice in the government and in the cabinet on behalf of veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also make a couple of comments about the success of the Australia Remembers program, because it has been a very vital program for the whole of Australian society. Within my electorate, I had great pleasure in being engaged in a range of activities for the Australia Remembers program, encompassing young school children attending primary schools, through to some of our most senior members of our community being involved in some wonderful celebrations and commemorations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to single out two particular events. The first one was a musical event that we staged in Brisbane at the Southbank piazza which was called `Bridging the Generations'. This Australia Remembers celebration was designed, as the title says, to bridge the generations between those young people from the 1930s and 1940s to the young people of the 1990s, so that the young people of today could understand some of the joy and happiness and some of the songs and dances that the young people of the 1930s and 1940s enjoyed, so that it was not all a sombre reflection on the sorrows and tragedies of war, but a part of our celebration of life and the good times that people had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `Bridging the Generations' concert involved some 200 young people from primary and secondary schools around my electorate who joined together with some older singers who sang a number of the songs of the war years and massed choirs. We also had a couple of school bands playing some of the big brassy sounds of the 1940s. And we had a `Bridging the Generations' dance group which was made up mainly of 70- to 80-year-old ballroom dancers who did a medley of about six different dances from the 1940s, which was greatly enjoyed by the audience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the evening, we took the opportunity to remember some of the particular important points during the war years. The Mount Gravatt High School put on a short play which emphasised some of the personal recollections that people had from our local area about their time in the war years, some of the things that they saw and some of the things that they suffered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all it was a wonderful evening. My congratulations go to all of the people who helped pull it together. It was staged by the Moreton commemorative committee for Australia Remembers, but it was particularly pulled together by a small subcommittee which organised the `Bridging the Generations' concert, led most ably by the principal of Greenslopes State School, Mr Geoff Mill, who did an outstanding job in bringing together all of the different primary school bands. He was helped by Mr Graham Mellor from the Catholic Education Office who assisted in bringing together some of the Catholic schools involved, particularly the band from St Laurence's college, to perform at the concert. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second event, which was a very important and a more sombre occasion, was the opening of Australia Remembers Place, which is now established in Stimson Park on the corner of Ipswich Road and Beaudesert Road in Moorooka. This is now a permanent memento to Australia Remembers and to the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War. It has been put in there by very generous support from the Brisbane City Council which, firstly, allowed us to establish this place in Stimson Park and, secondly, spent the money to build the pathways, build the gardens and plant the trees and flowers in Australia Remembers Place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My thanks go to Jim Soorley, the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, who has been a very strong backer of the Australia Remembers program throughout Brisbane, but particularly was very supportive of the establishment of Australia Remembers Place. It is the only specific memorial to the Second World War in my electorate and one of the few that exists in Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have throughout Australia many fine memorials to the First World War, and the names of veterans who gave their lives in the Second World War have often been added to these First World War memorials. But there are very few Second World War memorials only, and this Australia Remembers Place in Stimson Park in my electorate will be a very important reminder of the unique contribution that many people made in the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The place is designed to have two main arcs that your eye immediately goes to. One represents the African and European conflict and it has a number of plaques to specific conflicts within that theatre of war. The second arc goes to the Asia-Pacific conflict and it has a number of plaques that commemorate particular campaigns in that theatre of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plants in the African and European garden are flowering shrubs and trees from Africa and Europe and the plants in arc of the Asia-Pacific garden are from the Asia-Pacific region. The flowering plants in the African and European garden will flower around early May, which is the time of the ending of the Second World War in Europe. The flowering plants in the Asia-Pacific garden will flower at around mid-August, at the time of the achievement of victory in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large plaque in one garden commemorates Australia Remembers Place and that garden is full of the peace rose to commemorate what that sacrifice by all of those people who fought in all of those campaigns was all about, namely, the achievement of peace and freedom for all the peoples of the world and particularly for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has much to be thanked for&mdash;it has been his initiative and his drive that has kept the Australia Remembers program going throughout 1995. He has done an outstanding job and the people of Moreton, the people of Queensland and the people of Australia are very grateful to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for all the good work he has done on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House should also be supportive of this legislation, because although a couple of clauses here will make some changes to benefits, by far and away the vast bulk of this legislation is positive and built upon many other positive achievements that this minister has made throughout his period as Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. We are debating the Veterans' Affairs (1995-96 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, which amends two bills. As seems to be the practice in this place, a bill will often be brought into the parliament making a large number of changes which never seem to share any common thread. This bill amends the Defence Service Homes Act of 1918 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act of 1986. There are 14 changes made pursuant to the budget delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) some months ago. Four of these have no financial impact; five will cost the Australian taxpayer money, and five will save money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total budgetary impact will not be large when one looks at the overall level of Commonwealth expenditure today. Indeed, one ought to appreciate that the net result will be that the veteran community will be worse off financially. The honourable member for Moreton told us that the vast bulk of the amendments improved the situation for veterans. There are some of those but one must realise that the government is taking away benefits from other veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are major amendments in relation to both acts. There is a most important amendment to extend the defence service homes eligibility to full-time members of certain World War II women's services. The legislation also seeks to allow the assignment of defence service homes eligibility to providers of retirement village and granny flat accommodation. The legislation seeks to set a minimum age requirement for the partner service pension. It also seeks to extend the income support supplement to war widows and widowers with pensioner partners and seeks to extend the treatment eligibility for veterans suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, in regard to the changes made to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918, this act provided housing assistance for certain men and women who have served our nation in various spheres of conflict since 1918. The 1993-94 annual report of the Repatriation Commission and Department of Veterans' Affairs states that as at June 1994 there were 107,124 persons in receipt of defence service homes assistance. As a person who formerly practised law, we had many clients who sought loans under the defence service homes arrangements. From time to time government policy has varied and at times people were disadvantaged by changes in government rules and regulations. Up until the present time the loans were available only to certain persons. The amendment before the House seeks to extend the eligibility to former members of World War II women's services who did not actually serve overseas during wartime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might say that the government is seeking to remove some discrimination but the government cannot strut about or be too proud of this change because this amendment results from a complaint made at the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and actually follows a conciliation conference. It was not that the minister got up one morning and said: `This is an injustice that must be rectified.' A conciliation conference drew this to the government's attention and, in effect, the government has been dragged kicking and screaming into the House to propose this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, many women were not given the opportunity to serve overseas. The general belief at the time, 50-odd years ago, was that it would be better to fill the jobs and positions of men at home with women so that men would then be free to serve overseas in the war zones. Women who were members of a number of services up until now have not been eligible to receive defence service home loans. That was an obvious discrimination and completely unfair. I am pleased that the government, however reluctantly, is seeking to change the provisions to permit members of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women's Army Service and the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force to receive the benefits they should have received many years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also to benefit from the amendments are some former members of the Australian Army Medical Women's Service. Also, full-time paid members of the voluntary aid attachment during the war will receive the benefit of the amendment we are currently debating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past it was considered that the services in which these women who will now benefit worked were, in effect, raised merely for home service and that the very important contribution they made to the war effort was not sufficient to make them eligible to apply for a defence service home loan. It should be noted that male volunteers who did not serve outside Australia have been eligible for defence service homes assistance for a very considerable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major development included in the legislation is the assignment of defence service homes eligibility to providers of retirement village and granny flat accommodation. In effect, this keeps before veterans a wider range of housing options. As many of our veterans are not as fit and able as they used to be, they are clearly at this time of their lives looking at housing options. I am pleased to see that the government is bringing this amendment in, which will provide a wider range of options to veterans so that they will not be disadvantaged. The legislation allows for the assignment to providers of a granny flat despite the fact that the particular property might not be owned by the veteran or the veteran's spouse. This would benefit many veterans who might well make an addition to a home owned by their child. So they have this sense of independence while still being close to family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the amendment allows for the assignment to a retirement village that provides accommodation mainly to veterans or their widows. The legislation encourages independence and freedom of choice. In the electorate of Fisher, a very fine electorate, we have two war veterans' homes. One is at Caboolture, which is going to the new seat of Longman, which will be represented by Malcolm Brough for the Liberal Party after the next election. But I am retaining the establishment in Caloundra, known as the Centaur home. Both the home at Caboolture and the home at Caloundra are very well run. Matron Gwenda Shaw at Caboolture does a fine job and, along with her staff, has gone out of her way to make sure that the veterans living in the war veterans home have a very caring environment. It is a desirable place in which to live. Garry Dukeson, the director of nursing at the Caloundra Centaur home, has been able to create a similar environment there. It is important that as a nation we seek to care for our veterans at a time in their lives when they need this kind of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are changes to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and earlier speakers in the House have outlined what these changes entail. Basically it will mean that partners of veterans who are currently allowed to receive a partner service pension where they are married or in a marriage-like relationship with a veteran receiving an age or invalidity benefit will not necessarily have this benefit extended. The amendment provides that a person is not eligible for a partner service pension unless he or she has reached the age of 50 or unless he or she has a dependent child at the time an application is made for the pension. It ought to be noted that this provision is not retrospective and will not affect those receiving or those who have been determined to be eligible for a partner service pension prior to 1 October 1995. The Department of Veterans' Affairs budget review 1995-96 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is generally accepted that people under 50 years of age should not be expected or encouraged to retire. Payment of partner service pension to younger partners does not encourage those people to seek work in their own right. Future non-veteran partners under 50 who are not looking after a dependent child or severely handicapped veteran and are unable to obtain work may be eligible for partner allowance, sickness allowance or disability support allowance from the Department of Social Security.               </PARA>
<PARA>So, even though these changes are coming in, there will be a safety net there for those who need it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, as has been indicated by the shadow minister, is not opposing this amendment, but we do have some reservations, particularly regarding Vietnam veterans. It is fairly obvious that many Vietnam veterans now aged about 50 could well have spouses somewhat younger, five or 10 years younger, and it seems that the government is going to disadvantage those families. This is a matter the government really ought to look at very closely. The Vietnam veterans are not happy about this particular amendment as they feel that it does not adequately recognise their age group and that indeed it is an unjust imposition on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some Vietnam veterans are already eligible for various entitlements but, due to the simple fact some spouses are not 50 years of age, they may get nothing. It would not take too much for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) to take this matter back on board and to once again try to make sure that the justice which everyone wants to see extended to veterans is indeed extended to veterans of the Vietnam War. I was very pleased to hear that the shadow minister, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), will be continuing to look at this matter because it is very important that Vietnam veterans be given the same consideration as other veterans who have served their nation in the way Vietnam veterans have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the amendments before the House. We have a number of reservations, particularly relating to Vietnam veterans, but I do not believe that it is too late for the minister to look at this again. With a couple of nips and tucks in the legislation, I think the minister could rectify what is probably an unintended consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A moment ago we heard the honourable member for Moreton say that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has driven the Australia Remembers program. The honourable member for Moreton seemed to indicate that had it not been for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs we would not have had an Australia Remembers program&mdash;a program which has been patently successful, as everyone in the nation would accept. I think we really ought to pause for a moment and recognise that the success of the Australia Remembers 1945-95 program has not been due solely to the minister; it has been due to the bipartisan approach that both sides of politics have taken to the Australia Remembers program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, the Australia Remembers program is bigger than politicians; the Australian community has fully embraced the Australia Remembers program. Right across every electorate in the nation committees were set up, and those committees worked very hard. They called for submissions, and projects were submitted to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Right across the 147 House of Representatives electorates there are very many worthwhile projects which will see bricks and mortar monuments to the Australia Remembers program in place for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will not be surprised to hear, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the electorate of Fisher has fully participated in the Australia Remembers program. When the minister announced that seeding funding of $20,000 was going to be provided for every federal electorate throughout the nation I called a public meeting at the Caloundra RSL. A wide representation of RSL members from throughout the old electorate of Fisher attended. We tried to get some extra money for the electorate of Longman. I think the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) was also very keen for money to be provided separately for the electorate of Longman because that would have left more for his electorate of Dickson. Indeed, had we been able to get money for Longman there would have been more for the redistributed electorate of Fisher. The minister said, though, that only existing and not new electorates would be funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman of the committee we set up was Mr Gordon Caldwell of Blackbutt; the secretary was Dick Alchin of Caloundra; the treasurer was Bill Platten of Caloundra, and the committee members were Jim Courtney from Bribie Island, Bernie Barton from Glasshouse, Bob Russell, Gordon Granzien from Toogoolawah, and John Hodgkinson. This committee worked together and called for applications from throughout the electorate, recommending funding for some 19 projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, when one is a representative of a geographic area considering applications for funding from that geographic area there would be every opportunity for a bunfight, but I must say that this committee worked very well. Whenever a local project was being considered the representative from that area on the committee did not take part in the discussions, with the result that the 19 projects which were recommended from the electorate of Fisher were indeed 19 very worthwhile projects. I am very proud to have been part of this particular program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also say that there were contributions made by people who did not receive seeding funding. For instance, the Buddina State School opened a cenotaph and memorial garden. The way the entire school community contributed was tremendous. The principal, John Brooker, and the school community got behind this project, and the fact that it was such an outstanding success&mdash;involving also the local Kawana Waters RSL&mdash;was a credit not only to John Brooker but also to all the staff, students and parents of the Buddina State School. Peter Koster from the Bokarina State School got into the action too. They also opened a memorial garden in conjunction with the Kawana Waters RSL. I was privileged and proud to have been part of both of those ceremonies. What continues to happen in the electorate of Fisher with respect to the Australia Remembers program is indicative of what is continuing to happen throughout the nation in this particular year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech on this bill the shadow minister once again drew to the attention of the House the fact that the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan), on the back of his application form, had a lot of party political information regarding the Australia Remembers certificates. I think all of us on both sides would condemn the honourable member for Lilley for doing this because he is politicising what is really a non-political issue. I now announce to the House that it seems he has withdrawn the side of his application which is critical of our side of politics. Indeed, he now has a document which on one side has an application for a certificate of appreciation in recognition of wartime service to Australia, and on the other side we find he is announcing Wayne Swan's community information kits and sheets. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The careers of hundreds and thousands of young men have been interrupted and in some cases partially ruined. There is a break of education, training and opportunity which cannot be repaired. It is perfectly true that experience is gained, but that is not material to an ordinary civil vocation.

<PARA>So we had two sentiments expressed by two great Australian Prime Ministers. As a coalition member, I must say that I agree with the comments made by both Prime Minister Chifley and Prime Minister Fadden. It is very important that, as members of parliament dealing with veterans' affairs through the bill we are discussing today, wherever possible we are bipartisan, that wherever possible we endeavour to make sure that we do not play party politics with the lives of ex-service men and women who went overseas to make sure that succeeding generations are able to enjoy the freedom, stability and way of life that we have today in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Australia Remembers program has been such a success is a credit to everyone in this place and a credit to the entire Australian community. I am pleased to see, in the area of veterans' affairs, that we have adopted these sentiments of Chifley and Fadden but, with respect to the legislation that we are debating, I would ask the government once again to look at the case of Vietnam veterans because Vietnam veterans are going to be disadvantaged by the amendment I referred to earlier. It is important to be fair, reasonable and just. We do not oppose the legislation before the House, but we ask the government to reconsider that particular matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I start my speech on the Veterans' Affairs (1995-96 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill, let me just say that I find it somewhat ironic that members of the opposition lecture this side on social security, family support and a safety net that is available to all Australians. If there is any government in the history of Australia that has ensured that all the needy people in Australia have a safety net, it is this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia remembers and this government remembers. I am proud to say that veterans' affairs are of great concern to this government. They always have been and, while we continue on the government benches, they always will be. This has not always been so. There have been governments in Australia's history that have tended to ignore the needs of the men and women who fought for the freedom of our nation and our way of life. But the time has arrived where changes need to be made to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments comprise 14 key points which will provide greater services and benefits to veterans. Indeed, these amendments are about increasing flexibility and making the veterans' affairs support system more user friendly in areas such as housing, health, treatment and provision, and insurance. The amendments will also reduce areas of waste, inequality and, particularly, bureaucratic delays. Everyone in this House knows how many representations they make to Veterans' Affairs to support the veterans in their electorate when bureaucracy, unnecessarily in many situations, delays the assistance that is sorely needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that the opposition is supporting these amendments. They have made some political capital of the fact that veterans' spouses under the age of 50 may be removed from the safety net of Veterans' Affairs. While I understand that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) later this evening will address this issue, no-one from this side is suggesting that they would be removed altogether from the safety net of social security. That has never been the intention of the government. It is not our intention to remove any needy Australian from any safety net. The opposition should keep that well in mind when they are talking about budgetary cuts and about how they might do things, if they get the opportunity to cut spending. I am sure they are looking at cuts to the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment under this legislation is to provide assistance under the Defence Service Homes Act where title is to be held as tenants-in-common. As I said, there is flexibility and it is user friendly, allowing the beneficiary the maximum flexibility of the system. It will assist clients who are wishing to hold title as tenants in common, allowing clients who have pooled loans recognition of title. These changes are in keeping with current commercial practices and they will not affect a great number of clients. But the ones they do affect will receive the benefit they wish. That, of course, is the wish of the government&mdash;that where people require this form of assistance, it be available. So the fact that the amendment may affect only a few is really irrelevant. The ones who need it are the ones who ask for it, and they will get that form of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment will provide defence service homes benefit to full-time members of the World War II Women's Service. It is not to any previous government's credit that this group of Australians have not received this benefit until now&mdash;after 50 years. Until now the Defence Service Homes Act of 1918 discriminated against women by not entitling them to the full defence service homes benefit if they had not served outside Australia, regardless of their Australian service. For 50 years, women in the Australian armed forces have received little or no recognition of their commitment and loyalty to Australia. Men have always had access, even if they served only on Australian soil. This change will improve the position of over 200 women in the first year. While government outlays may be relatively minimal, to the people who receive the benefit it is something that is not only needed, it says that Australia as a nation thanks those volunteer women who served Australia so well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is important to me as a representative because I am aware of several ladies who served as nurses in France before the German invasion and following D-Day. These ladies faced risks as great as soldiers did, if not greater, because they were unable to defend themselves. I have also met ladies who were seeking to move closer to their families and friends, and required a loan to purchase smaller apartment style accommodation. I think it is great that there is flexibility in aged housing these days. This government certainly has a commitment to hostel accommodation and to nursing homes&mdash;but they do not suit everyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families today tend to be diversified. They do not stay in one locality or community. Many people, as they age, want to get closer to the family support system but that has been denied to many of the elderly, particularly widows, because they did not have the mobility or capacity to get rid of their home and purchase another one. To those ladies who were previously refused access to defence service home loans, I say that this injustice has been rectified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment allows the assignment of a defence service home loan entitlement to certain providers of accommodation. At present the current loan conditions for defence service home loans do not accept the properties in question as collateral if the home or unit is within a retirement village. You and I both know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in the Hunter region there are some magnificent retirement villages that provide first class accommodation and are there purely because of grants from this government, something that this side of politics is extremely proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often, retirement villages offer only a leasehold agreement and, therefore, provide less security for the loan provider. The current act does not allow loans to be used for this purpose and the legislation will see this revoked. Again, it is all about flexibility and being user friendly. Not only will this provide veterans with a wider choice of accommodation facilities, it will allow them to retain their independence, freedom and privacy&mdash;the things they fought for so long ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterans can live in a retirement community with a body corporate able to provide essential services and care usually found only in nursing homes. The extension of the loans criteria is a recognition of the value that the community places on these Australians. The take-up rate will be approximately 70 in the first year. Again, it is not a major cost item to the government, but it is of major value to those people who require it. I am sure that it will be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth amendment provides assistance under the DSH Act for a company title or leasehold title. The current act does not provide conditions under which a property may be purchased under company titles. While this has not affected many people, especially following the spread of strata title units, there is still a number of people who wish to take on loans under these conditions. This is simply a procedural matter to assist in the processing of requests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth amendment cancels the subsidy in relation to deceased estates where there is no surviving spouse. This will prevent subsidy conditions being continued to an estate after a veteran and their partner have died and there are no more dependants. There is a three-month period following the death of a veteran and partner without dependants before the cancellation of the subsidy, allowing time for the executors of the estate to make all the necessary arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth amendment will allow greater flexibility to clients by allowing subsidised advances to be used for housing purchases different from the initial house if that is no longer available or suitable. The existing certificates only last three months, which requires clients to apply for new certificates for each new project. The changes will see this time period extended. This will represent a saving to the government. Again, it is not a lot, but it will benefit in the order of 100 people per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seventh amendment will extend the pool of persons eligible to insure dwellings under the Defence Service Housing Act. At present, the current legislation does not allow a DSH client to be eligible for DSH insurance without undertaking a defence service housing loan. The amendment will allow veterans who may own their own home outright to take out defence service housing insurance. This insurance offers a broader cover than most insurance packages. Its structure shows an understanding of the requirement of veterans in the community. Defence service housing insurance covers flood damage, which is rarely covered by private institutions without high premiums. While it may seem far away, Mr Deputy Speaker, flood damage in your electorate and mine is of major importance. With the way it was raining when I left home this afternoon, perhaps we should take out some. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The current legislation does not allow portability of the loan if the client decides to move. We are talking about people of advancing years. These people may require movement, as I have already indicated, to be near their family, but they cannot move because of financial arrangements. If they have an existing loan and the loan is not portable, they will stay there. They will put up with the hardship that is incurred by that. Under this legislation, the loan will become portable. That in itself is a major benefit to those people who need it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important for the entire community, not just the veterans. It allows veterans to remain in their own area as they grow older, even if their housing needs change. An example of such a situation would be a veteran couple who sell the family home and move closer to their children in perhaps smaller unit style accommodation. The portability of the loan would allow the couple to take their existing borrowings and transfer them to the new property, thus allowing the veterans to move freely, to live closer to their family and friends and to have greater access to health and community services and, of course, the family network that is so important to the elderly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community of today owes a debt to those who fought for our nation in the past. We can repay this debt through allowing them to remain an active part of the community, as most of them wish to be. I am sure all members know that these people are fiercely independent. They gave something to Australia that no other generation has. They want to be independent. These amendments are about assisting that. Finally, the changes will repeal the insurer of last resort, which has often seen the DSH liable for substandard physical or moral risks. This will benefit the community as a whole and reduce the financial burden on the government, as it has been previously placed in a position that private insurers would not accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eighth amendment redefines the terms and stabilises interest rates for further advances under the Defence Service Housing Act. The variation to the terms of the loans will see loans become more portable and reduce the pressure on those who choose to move. At present, if a recipient chooses to move and take the loan with them, their interest rate will increase, changing what would have normally been, for example, a $63 per month loan repayment to a $237 per month repayment. This current system discourages the elderly from moving closer to family, friends and medical and community support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ninth amendment is designed to amend eligibility for income support and compensation payments. The amendment to this act will simply redefine the qualifying characteristic for eligibility to service or disability pensions. The act of 1920 set out the criteria for eligibility for age or disability pensions. The current amendments only seek to explain this more clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clarification is designed to reduce the number of veterans pensions being paid to people who are not eligible for a pension. There have been several cases where people who were not in operational areas have received pensions to which they were not entitled. The amendment also makes special provision for the payment of pensions to people who were ordered to serve in Korea but who served only in Japan. Until now, these people were not recognised as being in an operational area. The amendment seeks to redress this problem and recognise the contribution made by these people to the defence of the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 10th amendment is to adjust disability pension lump sum arrears where the social security pension or income support supplement has been paid to the veteran's partner during the arrears period. At present, the current act has a provision allowing for excess income support payments to veterans to be deducted from their veterans pension arrears. However, this provision does not allow for the deduction of any amount of an existing pension benefit or allowance that would not have been paid to the partner if a new pension or allowance had been paid. This amendment will establish a new methodology for the calculation of the lump sum arrears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 11th amendment will set a minimum age of 50 years for partner service pensions. As I have already indicated, I understand that this amendment is to be addressed by the minister later this evening. As I also pointed out, it does not mean that that partner of less than 50 years of age would be denied access to the government safety net. They certainly will continue to be the recipients of benefits. I look forward to what the minister has to say later today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act will allow the retention of eligibility in certain circumstances when the veteran ceases to be paid. This could be due to receipt by the veteran of a special compensation lump sum payment or similar payment. The act will also limit the rate of service pension to the married rate in any circumstances where the other member of a couple is not receiving a pension or benefit. These last two measures will allow partners and dependants to continue to receive pensions even if their veteran partner or provider no longer receives payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 12th amendment will disregard war widow or widower pension as income in the calculation of bereavement payments. This will bring together pension payments to war widows and widowers of disability and age pensions under the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Previously, they had been under the control of the Department of Social Security. This act will see war widow or widower pensions not included as income in determining bereavement payments but will see them included in determining income support supplement payments in general. This will see the government aid war widows and widowers as a total by $67,000 in 1995-96. </PARA>

This bill puts forward a number of proposals. I urge all members to consider them very carefully not the least because of the significance of this year to veterans, to the veterans of the Second World War, and naturally, in retrospect, to all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Bass, the most outstanding thing about this year has been the enormous success of the Australia Remembers campaign. I note the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is in the House at this time. He, his staff and his department are also to be commended for that particular campaign. It has been very successful. I am sure that is an observation that would be shared in all electorate offices all over this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many hundreds of constituents have contacted my office seeking information and material relating to that campaign. They have been, without exception, positive and favourable in their response to it. Seeing the real joy many are deriving from the campaign has been a highlight for me personally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Remembers has more than a symbolic relevance, however. Indeed, witnessing the strength of community support for Australia Remembers prompts an important realisation. It is about more than just remembering. It is about doing. It is about paying real respect to those who defended our country during the Second World War. That means ensuring our servicemen and women continue to receive an appropriate and benefiting level of care, even as we move away from the war era and into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill that we are speaking on here today, which has been put forward, takes several positive steps towards achieving this objective. It demonstrates that this government is committed and willing to put its money where its mouth is when it comes to recognising the particular needs of servicemen and women&mdash;needs which, while remaining essentially the same, will inevitably change as the service population ages and society in general changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the changes that I am most pleased with is that women are finally achieving equality of recognition and entitlement with their male counterparts.

Arising from the 1995-96 budget, the bill before us puts in place measures which will provide such women&mdash;servicewomen, partners of veterans and war widows&mdash;with the entitlements and benefits they deserve. Item 12 of schedule 1 will extend eligibility for defence service homes benefits to full-time members of the World War II Women's Service, including the Women's Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, the Army Medical Women's Service and the voluntary aid detachment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is significant because for 50 years these women have been denied defence service homes benefits unless they served overseas during the war&mdash;in contrast to their male counterparts who, by and large, automatically qualified. Representatives of the World War II Women's Service have long campaigned for this recognition and there is no question that they definitely deserve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the suggestion of indirect discrimination arising from the current legislation has been acknowledged by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I understand this was their finding early in 1994. Currently, subsection 4(2A) of the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 is almost certainly in breach of both sections 5 and 26 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, and the Department of Veterans' Affairs has no choice but to redress that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind, there remains no valid reason to delay this measure any longer. It should come as no surprise, by the way, that the estimated take-up rate for loans under this measure is around 200 per year in the first five years. The increase in options for housing, independence and comfort in retirement for eligible women will certainly make an impact here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other areas of veterans needs which have come under a degree of scrutiny in my electorate of Bass, as has been the case, I do not doubt, in many other electorates. Recently I attended a meeting of the Launceston RSL sub-branch at which specific matters relating to housing were raised. I have been looking into this area with a great deal of interest partly because I see it as an area which is constantly being improved and extended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, as with everything that is put into place, there is almost certainly always room for more flexibility in terms of providing accommodation. In this instance, it is in providing accommodation for war veterans and pensioners. The amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 are responsive to the reality of changing needs, and they certainly provide the flexibility that we have been looking for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Item 35 of schedule 1, for instance, allows for the assignment of a defence service home loan entitlement to certain providers of accommodation&mdash;those who can provide retirement village or granny flat accommodation. Other items extend this measure to benefit widows and widowers and to help provide loans for essential repairs. The area of loans for essential repairs has long been an argument with regard to housing for the elderly, and I am pleased to see that this is a measure we are looking at. There is a measure included in the bill to extend eligibility also for home insurance. We heard the previous speaker, the member for Paterson, expound on that particular area at great length. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important measure is to redefine the terms of and stabilise interest rates for housing advances. These seem like simple and obvious solutions to a range of problems and I think that they have come none too soon. Difficulties encountered by those wishing to use their service home loans to help them into retirement villages and other forms of accommodation should be adequately addressed by the proposed measures. Under existing arrangements, although a service housing loan can be used to buy a spot in a retirement village, in reality very few loans are made for this purpose. The main reason for this is that the form of tenure in most retirement villages does not satisfy the lender, Westpac, in terms of security. The amendment put in place in this bill gets around this problem by assigning the loan to the organisation, which is better able to satisfy security requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the war veterans pensioner population is ageing. We hear this on a daily basis. This goes hand in hand with changing needs. The one thing which should be kept in mind is that freedom of choice, the ability to live as independently as possible, is a common desire and ought to be respected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments before us not only help to fulfil individual needs for housing but also, in doing so, will have significant benefits further down the track. By helping a pensioner to live in a granny flat, for instance, where family care or alternative carer support may be readily available&mdash;many older citizens of our community do not wish to go into nursing homes; the option of getting a loan for a granny flat is going to be optimal for them&mdash;we will be able to alleviate some of the need for health and home care services. There could be significant downstream savings to health program expenditure as a result. We are always looking for some ways to make savings in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to see the bill includes amendments which extend pension eligibility and clarify previous fairly grey areas in the legislation. Those people, as we heard the member for Paterson remark, who were members of units which were allotted for duty in Korea but who served only in Japan will now be eligible for this pension under part II. This is a measure which will no doubt be made very welcome by that particular group of war veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also had a lot of contact with representatives of our younger veteran group. I am talking in particular about the Vietnam veteran associations. They have been concerned about various aspects of their entitlements to pensions and so on. They are the next generation, so to speak, of pensioners. They are looking towards their future and questioning their entitlements at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 85 of the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 deals with eligibility for medical and other treatment which basically relies on there being a war caused injury. Item 1 of schedule 6 of the bill extends such eligibility to veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder&mdash;we have heard a lot about it in recent times and will continue to hear a lot about it as our Vietnam veterans are ageing&mdash;a condition which is characterised by symptoms such as anger, confusion and memory problems, apathy, depression, panic attacks and so on. I am sure most members of this place have been in contact with Vietnam veterans who are suffering those particular symptoms. It is not only stressful to the veterans and their families but also stressful to their friends. It is particularly prevalent in Vietnam veterans. The amendment will go a long way towards redressing what have been perceived as longstanding inadequacies in benefits available to Vietnam veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thoroughly approve of the amendments which extend the eligibility for the seniors health care card. Again, from an electorate perspective, I can see a need for this card to be made more widely available&mdash;if only to help fill in some gaps in benefits available from one class of pensioner or veteran to another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I complete my remarks on this bill, I would like to spend some time talking briefly about the Australia Remembers program. Many people actually consider, now that VP Day&mdash;August 15&mdash;and the major celebrations are over, it is all over and done with. I guess most members of this place would agree with me that in their electorates it is generally alive and well. In my electorate of Bass I am fortunate that in November the minister will come to my electorate and present certificates of appreciation. I have been amazed at the number of people who are still contacting my office and asking whether they are eligible for these certificates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this has been very significant for veterans, particularly the World War II veterans. It has also allowed the electorate&mdash;young, middle aged and older people&mdash;to remember what the World War II veterans did for us and to reflect on all other conflicts. One of the special things is that it has made all of us aware of the veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also encouraged young people to learn about what happened. They were not alive in those years and they do not know much about what happened. Perhaps we have been a bit remiss in our schools over the past 50 years for not teaching our school children what has happened to the extent we should have. We have made our veterans proud of what they have done for us in all arenas of war. We have also put our thanks for what they did on the record. I take this opportunity to commend the minister, his department and his staff for all the hard work that they have put in on the Australia Remembers program and continue to put in on that program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, this bill represents a very sound and equitable response to the evolving conditions faced by our war veterans and pensioners. It can only result in immediate and measurable improvements in the prospect of our veterans overall and, in particular, those who have until now been excluded from receiving certain benefits because of obscure and sometimes discriminatory rationale. I give this bill my full approval in commending it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;First of all, I thank the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) for her kind and generous remarks and also thank all other speakers in this debate. It is quite poignant that we are discussing the Veterans' Affairs (1995-96 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill in this House on the very day that the national executive of the Returned Services League bestowed on me honorary life membership. I am very touched and satisfied with that. I probably do not deserve it, but in their wisdom they thought I did. I thank them very much for that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member. I understand this is the first time they have bestowed this highest of honours to a politician&mdash;certainly to a serving one anyway. That said, I would like to make a couple of points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to the comments of the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). In all my dealings with the member in his capacity as the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, he has always taken a very positive and very constructive role. He sees his role&mdash;and I commend him for it&mdash;as an advocate for the ex-service community. Again on this occasion with this particular bill he has taken the same approach. I know that he had some objections with respect to one of the measures being introduced in this bill&mdash;a measure which will hopefully be passed today. He has made it very clear that he will be monitoring the situation to ensure that nothing happens which will in any way impinge on the rights of veterans, particularly younger veterans such as those that served in Vietnam. I respect his views on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government did not take lightly its introduction of the 50-year age limit for partners of service pensioners who do not have dependent children. We need to be make it clear that the only people who may be affected by these initiatives  are those who on and from 1 October 1995 are less than 50 years old, those who are not receiving service pension and those who do not have dependent children or do not have a partner who is receiving the special totally and permanently incapacitated&mdash;TPI&mdash;rate of disability pension. With respect to the last condition, I will shortly be moving some amendments that will ensure that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three important principles which stand behind this initiative. Firstly, younger partners who do not need to stay at home in a carer role should be encouraged to contribute to their family's support and maximise their family's total income by continuing to participate in the work force. They should not expect to be able to stop working earlier than they would otherwise just because their partner is a service pensioner. Secondly, younger partners who are encouraged to participate or continue to participate in the work force as a result of this initiative are contributing to their own support in their eventual retirement through ongoing contributions. Thirdly, due to the changing gender roles in society and the significant changes in women's labour force participation in recent decades, over half of all women of work force age now participate in the labour force. On the basis of this statistic, it is no longer appropriate for the government to make income support payments to younger women on the assumption that they are dependent on a male partner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is committed to providing assistance to those who genuinely need it. Younger partners who are unable to find employment will still have access to assistance from the Department of Social Security in the form of partner allowance, newstart allowance, sickness allowance or disability support pension. This range of safety nets is also available to any other member of the community who is seeking work or support from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The carer service pension will still be available from the Department of Veterans' Affairs to those whose veteran partners require a significant level of care in the home. This government has developed a budget that saves money, and this initiative is one of the means of achieving those savings. However&mdash;and this needs to be made very clear&mdash;the additional resources that will become available enable the government to extend benefits in areas of identified need. For example, over $20 million has been provided to help meet the needs of veterans and war widows and widowers in age accommodation and in their own homes. The health care entitlements of over 140,000 veterans and their dependants will be expanded at an additional cost of over $20 million over a forward estimates period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sum of $5 million has been allocated to medical research, of which $3 million will be given to the Anzac Health and Medical Research Foundation, which will be attached to the Concord hospital in Sydney when it can get matching funds from the New South Wales state government. That is a project which I personally am very glad to support strongly, and I have indicated that support. We need to ensure that we research diseases of the ageing lifestyle. We are all getting older. The veteran community is ageing at something like 2 1/2 times the rate of the general community. The fact is that they are the ones that are feeling problems such as dementia and so on. I think we need a research facility. The moneys that I and the government are able to save in one area without any harm to existing pensioners can be used in those other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the rules for carer service pension will be relaxed and a range of additional benefits will be available for those caring for a severely handicapped person. Eligibility for income support will be extended to the older partner of veterans who are not yet eligible to claim service pension and to the widows and widowers of former veterans who did not claim service pension before their death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor commented that the initiatives in this bill result in overall savings to government. As I have pointed out previously and in my second reading speech, this bill is only part of a package of measures announced in the context of the 1995-96 budget. Next month I will be introducing a second budget measures bill with the remainder of the changes required to legislation. More importantly, from the point of view of overall expenditure, many of the initiatives in my budget package do not require any legislative change. I have mentioned some of those. These amounts that I have mentioned previously dwarf the savings mentioned by the honourable member for O'Connor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the contribution of my friend&mdash;and I say that quite sincerely&mdash;the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford). I do not think it would matter if the government and I gave away $100 billion tomorrow to the veterans' affairs portfolio. There is no doubt in my mind that my friend and colleague would find something wrong with it. I do not think there has ever been anything that I have ever done in this House regarding the veterans' affairs portfolio that he has not found something wrong with. I do not say that to be in any way critical, because I know of his own interest in this. For instance, he has been one of the biggest supporters of the Australia Remembers program, and for that I thank him. In fact, I have been in his electorate and have officially opened a memorial garden at Allambie Gardens for him. I am quite happy to go back again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for McPherson for some reason always tries to find some negatives. Even if there is nothing there, he will still try to find it. I say to the member, `Do not think simply because we are on opposite sides and because I represent the government, the Labor Party, that necessarily we will be doing things which in some shape or form will hurt veterans.' It is quite the contrary. He states quite unfairly&mdash;and I think deep down he will acknowledge this&mdash;that over the last five years or so we have been decreasing the entitlements of veterans. That is simply not true. It is not substantiated by the available evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just off the top of my head, with the help of some of my staff, I made a list of the new initiatives since I have been the minister over the last 18 months. We have put $50 million towards aged care. Just recently we have agreed to put in $200,000 for the Hellfire Pass memorial, $200,000 for the construction of a Korean war memorial at Anzac Avenue and a $20 million younger veterans package. We have extended the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, started a PTSD national centre at Heidelberg in Melbourne, provided gold cards for winners of the Victoria Cross and combined four treatment cards now into two. That will mean an extra 120,000 or 140,000 new veterans will come into extended eligibility for the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had new initiatives with the Arthritis Foundation of Victoria, research, as I mentioned, into the Anzac Health and Medical Research Foundation, books and videos on dementia and incontinence. And on and on it goes. I do not know what it is we have got to do to convince the honourable member for McPherson that we are introducing new initiatives all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for McPherson also raised a concern about the impact of legislation introduced last year, establishing a Repatriation Medical Authority and a Specialist Medical Review Council to improve the consistency of decisions made by the Repatriation Commission. I know that when we introduced this the honourable member for McPherson was quite concerned about it, but I have to say that that concern is not shared by the ex-service community. There is the odd one, but generally they are not concerned. The reason is that it has been working very well. As the member correctly pointed out&mdash;and he has a good memory&mdash;at the time the legislation was introduced I promised a review of the Repatriation Medical Authority. And I did. Only today it has been discussed with the Ministerial Advisory Council on Veterans' Issues, which is meeting at Parliament House today, the members of which I will be having dinner with shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also been consulting with members of key ex-service organisations and with the shadow minister, the honourable member for O'Connor, on the timing of the review. I certainly have not forgotten about it, and I want the member for McPherson to know that I am looking at it. Just recently I was requested by one of the larger ex-service organisations to leave the review until the Repatriation Medical Authority brings in more statements of principle. In the interim, I have requested that officers of my department prepare a progress report on the Repatriation Medical Authority's operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also mentioned concerns about the possibility of higher than normal rates of certain diseases among Vietnam veterans. My department is looking at morbidity, general health issues and vocational training and rehabilitation for younger veterans. That will commence this year. The department will also use data obtained from the Vietnam veterans' mortality study to shape these initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the member for bringing up the issue of motor neurone disease. The statement of principles on motor neurone disease is being reviewed by the Specialist Medical Review Council due to some new information becoming available and the outcome will be known in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I finalise this and before we proceed, I want to pay particular tribute to Mrs June Stone. She is one of the leading lights in the ex-servicewomen's organisations in this country, particularly those from New South Wales. She has been one of the most dogged lobbyists&mdash;a really strong lobbyist&mdash;for the extension of eligibility for defence service home loans to full-time members of ex-servicewomen groups who served during World War II without the necessity of having to have served overseas. I want to pay particular tribute to her, to Amy Taylor and to all those who worked to make this such a reality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk this evening about the Brian Mahon Easton petition, the Penny Easton petition. In particular, I want to go through some documentation concerning the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program of 11 September in which it was alleged that Mr Easton had boasted at parties, et cetera that he was going to get a bonus of $200,000 after he left Exim. I want to go through where that $200,000 may have arrived for Mr Easton.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some members may recall that in the Family Court matter Mrs Easton claimed in the course of proceedings that her husband, Mr Easton, was to receive $200,000 additional to moneys that he was otherwise entitled to on his retirement from the Public Service. The petition itself says in clause 2(a):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the petitioner's then wife and wife's sister gave false evidence on oath alleging that the petitioner would receive $200 000 additional to moneys that he was otherwise entitled to on his retirement. . . </PARA>
<PARA>In the same petition it also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a reference from the Official Corruption Commission to the WA Police Force, the Police could find no basis for the allegation that the petitioner would receive or be paid $200 000 in what could not be other than corrupt circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>On 12 September 1988, Mr Easton, then employed in the Public Service, conceived the embryo of the Aboriginal Home Building Cooperative. In a document that he forwarded to the Public Service Commission on that date, he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This concept in embryo is presented to you as a preliminary discussion paper on a proposal which would make practical and incisive use of some of the opportunities and funds available through the Aboriginal Employment Development Policy. The availability of adequate funding was further underscored in the Federal Treasurer's Budget speech on August 23, 1988 and again in the Premier's Budget Speech on August 30, 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>Interestingly enough, in this document Mr Easton concedes `the writer claims little special knowledge of Aboriginal culture or problems' but he does claim to have `expert knowledge and considerable experience in the manufacture of pre-fabricated housing for dispersed communities employing a work force of unskilled and often illiterate labour'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following this, the then Premier of Western Australia, Dr Lawrence, now the member for Fremantle, wrote a letter to the Public Service Commission. This followed an earlier minute which was forwarded on 18 August in which she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to our recent discussions concerning the availability of Mr Brian Easton to assist me with the review of the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act and the establishment of the review of infrastructure and services to Aboriginal Communities.</PARA>
<PARA>At that stage, Dr Lawrence was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. In her letter dated 30 November 1990, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to my minute of 18 August 1989 and your subsequent agreement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is to the Commissioner of the Public Service Commission of the Western Australian government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to Mr Brian Easton being available until 31 December 1990 to assist me with various reviews.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Easton is now engaged in finalising work on a number of approved proposals and reviews which require his continued involvement.</PARA>
<PARA>Following that, there was a document prepared by Mr Easton, an application to Premier Lawrence that she approve a sum of $614,640 seed funding for the Aboriginal Homes Development Association. These funds were obtained from the Aboriginal community development program through the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority of Western Australia, for which Dr Lawrence at the time had responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation from Cedric Wyatt, the Commissioner for Aboriginal Planning&mdash;and he still retains that office&mdash;was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That ACDP funds be applied in accordance with the approved budget as seed funding for the two year `set-up' activities associated with the development of the Aboriginal Home Building Project.</PARA>
<PARA>In that proposal Mr Easton then proposed a budget for the AHDA showing him to be paid $201,067. That was over a period between 12 September 1990 and 12 September 1992. In my view, that would constitute the $200,000&mdash;or could&mdash;for which Mrs Easton tragically made her claim in the first instance in her Family Court matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 18 December 1993 it was pointed out that, by comparison, the annual salary for the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs at that time was $84,940, which included expenses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Markets alone can never produce a completely socially acceptable allocation of private income or corporate investment, so there is always a need in the market economy for a strong regulatory framework. In pursuit of an effective competition policy we must never equate effective competition with a laissez faire approach to ownership or regulation. This is particularly the case in the banking industry, but it is also the case in the petroleum industry. I have spoken many times in this House recently about the need to regulate aspects of banking if certain social and economic outcomes are not delivered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to address the issue of the regulatory framework in the petroleum industry. This industry was subject to an Industry Commission report last year that recommended there be complete deregulation of the petroleum industry. As I said to the Australian Service Station Association at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The draft Industry Commission report, in advocating the abolition of maximum wholesale price setting, quotas on the number of service stations operated by major oil companies and deregulation of all oil company franchising is advocating sending the teams on the field without a referee. We will always need a referee in this industry, but to make the game faster and more competitive we should update the regulations and get rid of the rules which are out of date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There must be change in the industry, but it must be sensible change that gets rid of ineffective regulation but puts in place a regulatory framework for fair and open competition.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is in the oil companies' interests as much as everyone else that a simple regulatory framework exists so that we can rid this industry of the conspiracies, real and imagined, that bedevil public perceptions. However, I do not believe the total deregulation of the industry is in the best interests of industrial investment, the economy, small business or the motoring public. In my view, deregulation in the petroleum industry would give unacceptable market power to a few and, to this extent, deregulation would not be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government said at the time of the Industry Commission report that we would not deregulate but would seek negotiation of a new self-regulatory regime. The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) was appointed to see if such a regime could be negotiated. Unfortunately, I know from representations to me from petrol retailers and their families that, while these negotiations were going on, there has been a parallel push by some oil companies to attempt to restructure the market without a lot of thought for the impact of this restructuring on consumers or station operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told, for example, that Shell is close to removing 19 out of every 20 of its petrol reseller franchises and Mobil is moving in the same direction. Forcing out franchisees from sites to be run by the companies under different arrangements is happening at the same time as negotiations are taking place. All of this is happening when there is an act of parliament on the statute books which is designed to stop such a thing from happening. If it is true, I could not recall a greater effort at thumbing the nose at the parliament and the government than that, because it is pretty breathtaking. But it is more breathtaking to be doing that precisely at the time when negotiations are under way to remove legislation by which such an outcome would be equitable and lawfully secured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we continue to have petrol prices fluctuate wildly between different places. The country-city price disparity is huge and consumers, especially rural consumers, seem not to be getting a fair deal. The problem we have with Shell is that they are trying to eliminate many of their franchisees. The Shell National Action Group has had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the potential savings which Shell is claiming will flow from&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>its multisite franchise system&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">cannot be substantiated. We know that there is a growing body of opinion within Shell which supports this view. The alternative is not to reduce cost, but to increase control and influence over the retailing of petrol and other goods from service stations, with a view to edging up the margins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If other oil companies follow Shell's lead . . . then collusion on price will be easier to achieve. Moreover, if collusion were to occur, its effect would be instantaneous and spread over large areas. The most probable end result would be a substantial lessening of competition on a scale not yet experienced in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA>In short, the major oil companies are trying to achieve total vertical integration of the industry. That is why the package brought down by the minister for small business, Senator Schacht, last Thursday is so important. Small businesses, including service station owner operators, have welcomed the package. It promises the most far-reaching changes to the Trade Practices Act in a generation in this country to protect small business. That is particularly important for many of these operators, particularly the Shell operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> You would have thought that such a package would have received strong support from the business organisations and from the Liberal Party. It has not received that support from either the Liberal Party or significant sections of business. This is what the Pharmacy Guild of Australia has had to say about the approach of the larger business organisations in this country. Mr Greenwood from the Pharmacy Guild said this when talking about the approach of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems to indicate that they represent the big end of town ahead of the interests of small business. Surely that's the role of the Business Council of Australia. Over 80% of ACCI's member businesses are small to medium sized and its most important role should be to represent and lobby for small business.</PARA>
<PARA>ACCI has not been representing small business, neither has the Liberal Party. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) came in this evening to talk about exactly the same subject that I have come in here to talk about. I want to go further than just talking about the petrol resellers. I will go right back to looking at how the consumers in regional Australia are being unfairly dealt with as far as the petrol pricing regime of this country is concerned. Consistently this year, consumers have been paying 77c a litre for their fuel in the city of Port Macquarie, in Forster-Tuncurry they have been paying 77c a litre for their fuel and in Taree, on the highway, 75c a litre; but in South Dowling Street in Sydney, every time that I check it, it is 10c a litre cheaper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of things were addressed in the Industry Commission report that the member for Lilley identified. Might I say that the IC report was responded to 18 months or thereabouts after it was delivered to the government by the ministers responsible, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) having responded to that report last week. Another irony is that on Thursday of last week Professor Thomas Parry, who was conducting the New South Wales government inquiry into retail petrol prices in rural New South Wales, came down with his report, which identified a few different things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, let us go back to the Industry Commission report which recommended a couple of things that should take place with regard to terminal gate pricing and the Laidley agreement. Recommendation No. 1 of the IC report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth should withdraw the Ministerial Directions and terminate the existing price surveillance arrangements in relation to petroleum products.</PARA>
<PARA>The government response to that recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for continued prices surveillance will be assessed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in early 1996. The ACCC will also be asked to report on proposals to introduce terminal gate pricing.</PARA>
<PARA>Fair enough&mdash;that is a wait and see attitude. Many of the people that I talk to who are in that end of the industry that the member for Lilley has just referred to have identified recommendation No. 3 as being of great importance in getting access to fuel when it is available at a reduced price. Recommendation No. 3 of the IC report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government should encourage the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association, the Transport Workers Union and the oil majors to accelerate the withdrawal of the Laidley Agreement by negotiation. Failing progress in that direction, the Government should consider legislation to eliminate those provisions in the Agreement that have the effect of restricting competition.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's response states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The withdrawal of the Laidley Agreement is supported in principle. The Commonwealth believes withdrawal would be best achieved through the enterprise bargaining process.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know that that will go absolutely nowhere. Members should realise that the Laidley agreement restricts very severely access to anybody that is not a card carrying member of the TWU from entering refineries. A distributor from the country cannot just lob down there with a tanker and say, `We want to get a load of fuel,' because he will not be allowed in. If we are going to have fair dinkum competition that is supposed to be presenting the consumers of this country with benefits from the national competition policy, one of the first things that has to be eliminated from this industry is the Laidley agreement. That was also recognised by Professor Thomas G. Parry in his recommendations to the New South Wales government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose all that Bob Carr found out in New South Wales&mdash;they used it as a bit of an election ploy earlier this year; they would check out the disparity between petrol prices in rural New South Wales and the city&mdash;was that the responsibility really lies with the federal government and that the federal government has been sitting on the Industry Commission report on the petroleum industry for the last 18 months. A small step in the right direction has been taken by both ministers concerned, who released their report at the end of last week. But it is not going far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be far more positive action. If they are seriously supporting the national competition policy and if they seriously want to see genuine competition, then they should go that little step further with their macro-economic reform in this particular industry and allow greater access to oil refineries around Australia so that regional Australia can get access to that fuel the same way as our city counterparts can. At the moment, we are paying 10c a litre more. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My subject, sadly, is not as enjoyable as that of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith). The main headline on the front page of today's Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> reads `500 rail workers face axe'. The article by industrial reporter David Penberthy starts:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hundreds of South Australian railway workers' jobs are facing the axe under a severe restructuring of Australian National.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than 500 jobs are likely to go as a result of a review of AN's staffing and operations in SA and Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps this is even so in the electorate of Bass. The rail industry, as we in this place all know, has a proud history and is very much steeped in Labor's tradition, but the changes over the last few decades have simply left communities like Port Augusta, Port Pirie, Peterborough and Gladstone wondering when the next blow will come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have been restructured and restructured and restructured. They have been centralised, decentralised and centralised again. A cartoon in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> showing an Australian National employee tied to the railway track about to be cleaned up by a locomotive coming down at full speed sums up how many of these employees feel. The mayor of Port Augusta, Mrs Joy Baluch, summed up the situation and was quoted in today's Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There's only a handful of politicians and a handful of bureaucrats and a couple of bloody consultants who are driving the matter of the railway system of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Many times in recent months the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has been invited to Port Augusta and to Port Pirie&mdash;and of course to anywhere else in my electorate he may care to visit, but particularly those areas&mdash;and so far the silence has been deafening. Over many years now, there has been this ebb and flow of uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anyone denies that there needs to be change. But when you get this sort of uncertainty, combined with this constant centralisation and people leaving regions such as mine&mdash;which already has one of the lowest incomes in the country&mdash;it is perfectly reasonable for people to be upset. I see that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) is at the table. No-one expects miracles, but we do need to have this matter addressed at the most senior level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are peripheral issues which come around too regularly, but the government in many of its budget decisions in recent years has continued to impose costs on rail which are totally unreasonable. We are asking rail to be efficient and internationally competitive while at the same time piling hundreds of millions of dollars of increased taxes on it. We have got to come to a position in this country where rail is respected for the national role that it can perform&mdash;not for what it has done in the past but for what it can perform in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister must be part of those discussions. It is not good enough just to pass it to a consultant. It is not good enough to pass it to bureaucrats within the department. The communities of Port Augusta and Port Pirie expect more than this. When unemployment is such a serious issue in this country, particularly regional unemployment, and when the number on social security benefits is double the national average, this is a significant crisis in the state of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I say to Minister Brereton: come to Port Augusta, speak to the people and try to address those issues and stabilise a difficult situation. There are too many headlines like `500 rail workers face axe'. The government needs to face up to them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My interest lies with the Totalisator Agency Board. It is a monopoly on wagering owned by the people of Victoria. As one would expect, it makes a lot of money. Not only does Tabcorp own the TAB, but it also owns gambling systems and obtains revenue from over 9,000 gaming machines. It makes a nice little bit of income for the people of Victoria. As one would expect with a conservative government, the TAB is being flogged off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument is that by flogging off a state owned monopoly so that it will be a privately owned monopoly&mdash;the antithesis of what Hilmer is about&mdash;we will save money in Victoria. As Kenneth Davidson points out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, that is a load of nonsense. In effect, by selling Tabcorp the state of Victoria will lose revenue. For a one-off capital gain the state government of Victoria will lose this annual stream of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the TAB is privatised the reality is that the private company will pay tax of 33 per cent&mdash;and I think it is going up to 36 per cent. In order for the private company to maintain its revenue stream it has to improve its profitability. While Tabcorp is owned by the state government it does not pay tax. But the top end of town has decided that it wants to get the profit out of Tabcorp, so it is going to be flogged off by the Kennett government at an enormous loss to the people of Victoria. As Davidson points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . based on existing interest rates and profit forecasts for 1994-95, the Government is already out of pocket as a result of the sale by about $18 million a year (loss of $95 million revenue and savings of $77 million in interest expense).</PARA>
<PARA>What responsible body would sell a publicly owned asset that makes a profit to a private sector? Why would you do it?

As Terry McCrann points out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I am no great fan of Terry McCrann, but when he starts raising questions you know there is something pretty smelly about it&mdash;who would like to be given $8 million to make an investment that grows in value and produces an income of $330,000 each year? Who would not want to take that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Wilson has been appointed by the Kennett government to run Tabcorp before it is sold. The top end of town&mdash;Kennett's mates; snouts in the trough stuff&mdash;is down there and really getting into it. It is unbelievable. Ross Wilson's likely package, as near as one can find out, and this is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> which says that he has a $10 million package, includes a salary of $690,000 a year, an interest-free share loan of $800,000&mdash;so that he can buy shares in the float at a reduced rate&mdash;a housing loan of $200,000, a car and $10,000 worth of other perks. It is equivalent to a salary of $1.7 million. </PARA>

Those opposite have great concern for the battlers! What does the Liberal Party do when it is in government? It sells a state monopoly owned by the people of Victoria&mdash;the TAB&mdash;to its mates. Before the sale the government sets its mates up for either an $8 million or $10 million package, depending on whether you want to believe the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS>. The government sets them up beforehand and then flogs it off. As a result, the state of Victoria loses $18 million a year on the sale. Boy! And these people want to be in government! These are the people who are on about privatisation and competition. Competition? As far as I am concerned, a monopoly sold to the private sector is the antithesis of competition, it is the antithesis of Hilmer, and everyone on that side of the House should be ashamed to even acknowledge that it is happening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the comments of the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) in question time today, I note that the minister did not question the forensic status of the documents I attempted to table in the House on 5 June and 30 August: nor should he have as the three Suriname letters in particular had been subjected to exhaustive forensic and analytical examination for months beforehand. The matter has therefore been dealt with with great deliberation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 19 June I had provided the Australian Federal Police with copies of two of the Suriname documents. On 25 August I was informed that the AFP could not assess whether the documents were genuine. On 29 August the Minister for Justice did not refer to the documents as forgeries and asked that I hand all documents to the AFP. On 1 September I handed two more documents to the AFP, including the very complex letter dealing with the Marshall Islands affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, therefore, refutes the assertion of the minister at one point that I had not cooperated with the AFP. On 8 September I was advised by Superintendent Brian Hepworth of the AFP that the documents were thought to be not genuine, though he gave no explanation as to why he was of that opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous documents had taken two months to investigate. However, the second letters took only seven calendar days, or five working days, although they involved complicated major crime matters including alleged deposits of funds in an overseas bank, provision of passports to drug traffickers, and the Marshall Island's passport scam involving Graham Richardson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the contradictory findings of the AFP&mdash;contradicting themselves, not me, I might add&mdash;I sought the forensic opinion of Mr Neil Holland of Scientific Document Services Pty Ltd in Melbourne who is widely recognised as one of Australia's leading forensic experts. Mr Holland's highly detailed three-page report concurred with the original AFP assessment&mdash;he could not prove that the documents were genuine or otherwise. Moreover, he noted that there were no identifiable signs of document interference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the Minister for Justice claimed that the contents of the letters are not genuine. However, he provided no evidence whatsoever that the documents are forgeries. The DPP, whom he quotes with misplaced confidence, is not equipped to deal with such issues. Most significantly, the Minister for Justice notes that he has been advised that the contents of each of the letters is false, although he produces no proof whatsoever for this judgment. The Minister for Justice stated today, `Regrettably, in so far as this investigation proceeds, there matters must rest.' Why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present AFP findings echo Operation Wallah which cleared former senator Graham Richardson before the AFP investigation had even begun. The many unexamined roles of the present head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Michael Costello, and Melbourne tax haven expert Mr Mark Leibler are the real issues. All else, quite bluntly, is government contrived smoke and mirrors. </PARA>
