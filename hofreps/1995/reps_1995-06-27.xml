<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Maralinga rehabilitation project, SA.</PARA>
<PARA>The Maralinga and Emu sites are located in South Australia in the region north of the Nullarbor Plain. Maralinga is 270 kilometres north-west of Ceduna. Emu is 190 kilometres north-east of Maralinga. Between 1953 and 1963, Great Britain conducted several programs of nuclear warhead development trials at Maralinga and Emu. These included detonations of nine nuclear weapons and hundreds of `minor trials' that dispersed radioactive materials. The former test site areas are contaminated to various levels with plutonium and other artificially produced radioisotopes that present an unacceptable risk to future users of the sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1990, the Commonwealth government agreed on a preferred rehabilitation option for the Maralinga test sites as a basis for seeking a substantial contribution to rehabilitation works from the British government. It is intended that upon completion of the project the test site area will be returned to South Australian control for addition to the Maralinga Tjarutja freehold lands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed clean-up will reduce the radiological hazards of the test site to enable Aboriginal use and transit of the test site area, reduce and possibly eliminate the need for control and surveillance of the sites, and remove potential Commonwealth liabilities arising from site contamination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 20 June 1995, recommending the project at an estimated cost of $104.4 million at November 1994 prices. In its report, the committee recommended that an independent audit of the trials and the results of the in situ vitrification of material containing plutonium be undertaken by competent experts not associated with the project. If the results of the review indicate that the in situ vitrification process provides encapsulation and mixing of material to prescribed standards, the process can be extended to full-scale treatment of the burial pits at Taranaki. If the results of the in situ vitrification trials are inconclusive or do not provide results to prescribed standards, the further direction of the project should be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to these recommendations, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has advised that a cautious step-wise approach has been adopted to the assessment of the applicability of the in situ vitrification technology to stabilisation of plutonium contaminated debris pits at the Taranaki site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In accordance with the Public Works Committee's recommendations, results of field trials of this technology will be assessed by independent experts. These experts will report through the Australian Radiation Laboratory, the project regulator. Methodology for the alternative process of controlled exhumation and reburial of the pits at Taranaki is being developed in case the results of the in situ vitrification trials do not confirm that application of this technology at Taranaki is practicable and effective. </PARA>

<PARA>The Land Warfare Centre, Canungra, which this year saw the establishment of the defence intelligence wing, is a vital training establishment for the Australian Defence Force with a complement of 364 posted military personnel. The Defence Housing Authority is responsible for the provision of housing for married defence personnel at the Land Warfare Centre, Canungra.

<PARA>This proposal relates to the Defence Force structure review, which was announced by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) on 30 May 1991. Under this review, a regular army brigade is to be permanently based in Darwin by the end of the year 2001. This is being achieved by the phased relocation of southern based units to Darwin.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Commonwealth Law Courts building, Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1987 the government decided to provide clearly identifiable and purpose designed Commonwealth law court buildings in each capital city of Australia to accommodate the courts and their associated staff and facilities. In accordance with this policy, facilities have been provided in Sydney, Canberra, Hobart, Perth and Brisbane. Currently the needs of the Melbourne and Adelaide Commonwealth jurisdictions are provided for in leased office premises which have been adapted for court purposes, with the exception of part of the operation of the Federal Court in Melbourne which is housed in the old High Court building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To overcome the problems associated with leased premises, it is proposed that a purpose built Commonwealth court facility be provided in Melbourne. The decision to pursue construction of the new building was made after detailed assessment of a number of options to provide purpose designed court facilities for the jurisdictions, including the leasing of commercial premises and purchase and fit out by the Commonwealth of a suitable existing building. A construction option proved to be the most economically viable option. The scope of works provides for the construction of a building of 36,000 square metres of gross floor area which will provide accommodation for the High Court of Australia, the Federal Court of Australia, the Industrial Relations Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The site for the proposed development is located on the corner of William and Latrobe Streets in Melbourne, directly opposite Flagstaff Gardens. The estimated total cost of the building, including fit out costs and rise and fall, has been agreed at $108.4 million. It is proposed that a contract to document and construct the new building will be let in 1996-97 with all works scheduled for completion in 1998-99.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, and by reason of the urgent nature of the work, it is expedient that the following proposed work be carried out without having been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works: Sydney West Airport development</PARA>
<PARA>With the continuing problems at Kingsford Smith airport, it is imperative that the development of the Sydney West airport gets under way urgently. Hence, I am seeking the agreement of the House for the works to commence without consideration by the Public Works Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To achieve the targeted completion of 1999 within the next four years, the following activities will need to be undertaken: environmental studies with adequate community consultation, detailed design and planning for the airport, construction commenced and completed, relocation of a major high voltage transmission line off the airport site following completion of the route selection and environmental impact statement processes, and completion of the western orbital link and upgrading of Elizabeth Drive to ensure high quality road access to Sydney's centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the Public Works Committee reviewed the Sydney West airport project under the name of Badgerys Creek airport development stage 1, although at the time the project was a smaller general aviation development with an 1,800-metre runway. In its findings, the Public Works Committee concluded that, although the master plan for the ultimate development of the airport was appropriate, the 1,800-metre runway proposed by the Federal Airports Corporation was inadequate and unlikely to attract potential users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial development should include a 2,900-metre runway with the minimum associated infrastructure necessary to allow for both domestic and international operations. This should include the provision of navigational and visual aids and an instrument landing system. The Federal Airports Corporation should seek additional Commonwealth funding for the expanded proposals in accordance with the committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1994, the government announced cessation of the 1,800-metre runway development. Instead, the development of a 2,900-metre aircraft runway was to be accelerated. Since then the Federal Airports Corporation has commissioned specialist engineering consultants to prepare and cost various concept designs for the airport. These are based on a master plan which has not changed fundamentally since the 1992 Public Works Committee review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the latest budget announcements, my colleague the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) released the government's preferred plans for the development of Sydney West airport. It provides for a 2,900-metre runway and associated infrastructure sufficient to handle domestic and international operations. The airport is to be equipped with instrument landing systems, and the Civil Aviation Authority will be required to provide navigational and visual aids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed level of development is on a par with that recommended by the Public Works Committee in its 1992 review. The government has also announced that there will be considerable involvement of the private sector in the project. Sydney West airport will be packaged together with Sydney airport as part of the government's disposal program for federal airports. The Federal Airports Corporation will be responsible for the development of Sydney West airport until the airport is leased, after which the new lease will include forfeiture provisions to guarantee that the Sydney West development is completed by 1999. Costs of the airport development will be recouped by the lessee from a special charge on Sydney airport users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the urgent nature of the Sydney West airport development, in accordance with section 18(8)(b) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 I seek the support of the House for the expediency of the proposed work and its exemption from a second Public Works Committee review. I therefore commend this motion to the House. </PARA>

My only difficulty might be with the eventual sale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In late 1992 the Public Works Committee held an inquiry into the airport development at Badgerys Creek and reported to this parliament, as the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) has just said. Had the government at that time accepted the report and the recommendations of the committee, instead of Badgerys Creek now being about to be commenced it would be nearing completion or at least halfway to completion. What the committee recommended in 1992 is precisely what the government is proposing to do today, even to the extent of private sector involvement. We recommended it all. The only difference is that the project is beginning 2 1/2 years late and consequently will be that much more expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parliament, in its wisdom, sets up committees such as the Public Works Committee. We, like other committees, carry out our work with diligence. One would expect that, if the parliament is going to set up these committees, when we make a recommendation the parliament would at least accept what we have said. In this case, if our recommendation had been accepted it would have saved the Australian taxpayer a considerable amount of money and it would have saved residents of certain parts of Sydney from certain noise aspects they are now experiencing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that and having put in a plug for the Public Works Committee, I indicate that I welcome what is being proposed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise in the House to support the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. The EMDG scheme has been spectacularly successful in encouraging and assisting Australian firms, particularly small and medium firms, to enter the export ring. I am very pleased that the government's commitment in Working Nation to extend the life of this scheme for another four years has been brought to fruition in this legislation now before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a general proposition, the measures contained in this bill are designed primarily to improve the focus of the export market development grants scheme. That focus will increasingly come on to small and medium sized firms. These firms are the ones which various studies have indicated offer the best opportunity for export growth for Australia. I am pleased to say that many of those small and medium sized firms referred to in the McKinsey report and others are located in the electorate of Corio, which encompasses the Geelong region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures will have budgetary ramifications. They will better target the grant assistance available under the scheme and also contain the costs of the scheme. In the past, schemes such as this have had a somewhat chequered history. There has always been considerable debate in the business community, and within the bowels of government, about their effectiveness in stimulating exports. Many schemes in the past have been typified by runaway costs, budget blow-outs and widespread rorting by elements of the business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those responsible elements in the business sector have, of course, not been engaged in that practice. But it has been a sad feature of previous schemes that these practices have been allowed to occur and that the subsequent costs of the schemes have been quite substantial. It has taken a Labor government to refine this excellent scheme to a point where it is specifically targeted and where Australian taxpayers get the maximum result from the dollars that they are expending on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition speakers who have preceded me in this debate have made great play of Australia's export performance and they have outlined how they view that performance. I will take up later on in the debate some of the specific points that they made. I think it is important to understand that over the last decade there has been fundamental restructuring of the Australian economy. This government has pursued a comprehensive package of micro-economic reform, and the labour retraining programs that this government has instituted through Working Nation&mdash;programs that lead the Western world&mdash;have had spectacular success in improving the productivity and competitiveness of Australian enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been manifest in many reports that indicate the extent of export growth in Australia. One report brought down in late 1993 indicated that of the 32 economies that had recorded quite significant export growth since the mid-1980s, Australia recorded the fastest growth in elaborately transformed manufactures of any economy in the OECD. This was not an OECD report. It was a report containing a commentary on this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that report highlights the fact that Australia's export performance has been spectacular over the past decade. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) drew to the attention of the House in question time the other day the fact that Australia's international competitiveness had improved by some 40 per cent since 1983. You do not achieve that success overnight. It has been the leadership of this government in relation to economic policy that has resulted in substantial benefits in the economic area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see that the opposition member at the dispatch box, the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), is smiling. How he wishes that the coalition could emulate the record of this government in relation to export performance, growth, low inflation and low industrial disputations. Let us not go over the old ground because when we make those comparisons the opposition gets a little embarrassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The improvement in Australia's international competitiveness has not occurred overnight. As I said, the leadership of the government and the scheme we are debating today have been critical factors in the improvement of our export performance. When we look at our economic policies, which have given great stimulus to exports in this country, we see that it is this government, like no other before it, that has broken the back of inflation. The fact that we have achieved such record low inflation in this country has put us in the best competitive position to give even greater stimulus to those exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned, the government has also pursued a comprehensive program of micro-economic reform in the transport area and in financial markets. In this country we have seen massive tariff reform in key industries such as the textile, clothing and footwear industries and the passenger motor vehicle industry. Much criticism has been levelled at the government for the policies that it has pursued in these areas in the past. I must say that in my electorate some 4,000 to 5,000 jobs disappeared in those two industries by virtue of very courageous decisions that were taken by this government. But those policies are starting to bear fruit. For example, in the textile industry in Geelong we have seen substantial expansion. We are on the verge of quite massive reinvestments in new technologies and new long-term job opportunities that will be achieved as a result of our low inflation figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this government has been able to achieve through its labour market reforms, which have been undertaken without the social dislocation that has occurred in societies that have been run by conservative governments around the world in the last decade, has been unparalleled in the Western world. The government has also pursued a wide range of investment incentives. All of these things have served to lift the productivity of the manufacturing sector in particular and the economy in general. That lift in productivity has enabled Australian firms to contain costs and to become more competitive in the international environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That competitiveness has been encouraged very much by the export market development grants scheme which we are debating today. The scheme has been very critical in ensuring that exporters, especially the small and medium firms who have sought to enter the international trading arena on the back of new competitiveness that the Australian economy has achieved, receive support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw the attention of the House to some of the statistics regarding Australia's export performance over the last 10 years. Our total exports have increased by 6.3 per cent in nominal terms to some $64.6 billion in 1993-94. Over the past decade we have seen very strong growth in manufactured exports of about 16 per cent per annum. That is a revolution in Australia's export performance. But, when we go deeper into the statistics, we see that in the last five years, as far as elaborately transformed manufactures are concerned, their share of total exports has increased from 15 per cent to over 21 per cent and last year their growth was in the region of 14 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to examine not only the growth but also the diversity that has been achieved in the sorts of elaborately transformed manufactures that are now being exported. I am pleased to say that the outlook for our exports appears to be very sound. We have observed some contractions in the world economies, particularly the motor economies of Japan and the United States. But I think the overall assessment is that we will avoid the recessions that have bedevilled the international economic cycle in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 10 years this country has developed a revolution in the export culture. The government has introduced a competition policy on the back of the Hilmer report and, while I might not agree with every particular measure the government has brought down in that competition policy, nevertheless in key critical areas the competitive instincts of Australian enterprise, both public and private, will be strengthened by some of those reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the nature of the recent record levels of investment that have taken place in the Australian economy, we see that this particular investment is in future productive capacity. We will have the capacity over the next decade to meet world demand as well as domestic demand. The initiative of the new accord struck between the government and the ACTU, which was announced recently by the Prime Minister, will lock in not only the low inflation which is so critical to Australia's economic performance, but also some very real benefits to Australian households and Australian workers. Looking at the parameters of the total mix and scenario, I think any reasonable person would be optimistic about Australia's future, especially when noting our recent history and the magnificent strides which we have made in the export area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five of the amendments to the act represent substantial changes to the scheme in the wake of the Working Nation statement. Many of the amendments that are being proposed are more of a technical nature and either clarify or refine existing provisions or expand them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first major amendment I would like to deal with in this debate today is that relating to the life of the current scheme, which has been extended to the grant year 1998-99. That was a commitment we gave in Working Nation, and that is a promise that is being fulfilled by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear a lot from the other side about the broken promises of government. We cannot really levy that charge at the opposition because we have not really seen the colour of its ink, as far as policy goes. This is one of the hundreds of commitments that the government had already met when it came into office in 1993 and when it brought down the Working Nation statement in 1994. Evaluation of the export market development grants scheme indicates that there is a return of some $25 for every one dollar spent on this scheme, and I think it makes good sense to continue it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major amendment to the bill relates to access to the scheme by single-service tourism providers. I see the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) waiting in the wings. I am sure he will take this matter up. We know of his very intense interest in the tourism industry and, no doubt, he will have some very interesting things to say about this particular provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment recognises the enormous contribution made to the Australian economy by tourism. Provisions of the scheme are usually not made available to the service sector, unless they are declared in the regulations. With regard to this situation at the moment, for tourism services to be `eligible tourism services' under the act and regulations, three services must be provided&mdash;passenger land transport, water transport, air transport, accommodation, admissions to tourist attractions or the provision of tour escort facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the scheme to be extended to include the provision of single tourism amenities referred to as designated tourism services. The bill outlines the mechanics of assessing the benefits that might accrue to single-service tourism operators. The bill also allows the tourism industry access to the approved joint venture and consortium facility that operates under this particular scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that the government has opened up the scheme even further to Australia's tourism industry. It is Australia's biggest export earner. Looking at some of the statistics of this particular industry, some six per cent of GDP is earned or produced through this particular sector, and over six per cent of the work force is employed in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism is very important to many regional economies. That is why the government has recognised that potential in the scheme and has also recognised that potential in the budget. For example, some $80 million has been made available through the Australian Tourist Commission for overseas promotion. We are continuing to fund the Department of Tourism. Some $5.2 million has been made available for the regional tourism development program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that my electorate received the largest grant, I think, in Australia to finance a tourist information facility that will serve as the gateway to the Great Ocean Road and the great hinterland of the Western District in Victoria. We are providing $1.3 million for tourism research, $3.4 million for national ecotourism and $762 million for Sydney West airport, which will service the Sydney Olympic Games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular scheme and the provisions of the scheme relating to the tourism industry have come under some heavy criticism from those on the opposition benches. I listened with interest to the words of the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) in the House yesterday when he severely criticised the government for not going further down the road of opening up this particular scheme to tourism operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not doubt the sincerity of the interest of the honourable member for La Trobe. I served on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology with him. That committee produced a report which made some very specific recommendations about the access of the tourism industry to the EMDG scheme. However, I think he is being a little too critical of the government on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made a very strong commitment in this bill before the House to retain this scheme and open it up even further, not only to the small tourist operators but also to the small and medium firms, which I know is of great interest to the member for La Trobe. We have certainly broadened the access of tourist operators to this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, some people will argue that the government has not gone far enough in this regard, but I would ask them to keep in mind that this government operates under fiscal constraints, budgetary constraints, which have dictated that every proposal that has come up in the last budget must be subject to significant scrutiny. That scrutiny, when it is taken in its totality, has led to a budget surplus and a downward pressure on interest rates which obviously is of great benefit not only to the tourist industry but to small and medium firms elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take issue with the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who got up in this place and levied some very heavy criticism at the government's export performance. I really cannot understand the honourable member for Maranoa and many of the people opposite who continually run down Australia. It is bad enough that many of them cannot even countenance that Australia ought to have an Australian head of state. But when they really go and run down the nation's great export performance then I think it is legitimate to take issue with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Maranoa mentioned the New Zealand economy. What he failed to say is that the New Zealand economy has basically gone back to the level that it was at in 1984. There are several hundred thousand New Zealanders working in Australia. I simply put the proposition: if it is so good in New Zealand, why are they over here? Indeed, if it is so good in New Zealand, why don't some of the members opposite go and live there? They want to run down this country. They want to run down the export performance of this nation. They cannot even countenance an Australian head of state, yet they get up in this House day in and day out and run down the Australian economy and the Australian work force. I commend this bill to the House because it gives very strong support to a significant sector of the Australian economy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I welcome the comments made by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) regarding the extension of the export market development grants to the tourist industry, may I just say to him that one of the reasons I am intervening in this debate on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill is that what we have before the House at the moment is an amended bill. This bill has come back from the Senate with some amendments that have vastly improved the legislation. It has specifically singled out the tourist industry as one industry that should receive even more consideration from the present government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's amendments in the Senate raised the benefit amount that would be available to tourist operators to the full 50c in the dollar and also allowed for establishment of joint ventures within the tourist industry to be part of this particular scheme. It absolutely amazes me that the government could have come into this place with its original bill in light of the fact that we have already had two joint parliamentary committees, including members of the government's own political party, which have recommended that the tourist industry get full consideration. Yet when we saw the original bill, we noted that the tourist industry had this discrimination placed upon it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It brings me back to the original concept of the EMDG: that is, when it did apply to the tourist industry in those heady early days of the 1980s, the industry had full access to the EMDG until 1985. You might remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that after 1985 the government brought in what I believe was probably an ill-advised TOPS scheme. There were all sorts of troubles with that scheme. It floated off. Then we had the regeneration of EMDG which applied only to what could almost be described as `the club' in terms of the inbound tourist industry. The fight has gone on from there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two joint committees of this place have recommended that the tourist industry get full consideration&mdash;and well it should. As the member for Corio has already said, the tourist industry is our biggest foreign exchange earner and our biggest private sector employer in Australia. The potential of the industry is quoted time and time again by the government. But the reality is that until such time as it does receive equitable treatment it may never reach its full potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was absolutely horrified to read the words of Senator McMullan in the other place when he was replying to the debate on the bill. His basic argument was that the tourist industry is getting plenty of consideration and plenty of funding&mdash;the member for Corio also mentioned that the industry will receive $80 million this year&mdash;and that will just about do it. This really highlights the complete lack of understanding this government has, and many bureaucrats have, of the way in which the tourist industry operates. I suppose if you asked members of the bureaucracy and a number of the ministers in this particular government, `Who is the tourist industry?', they would probably tell you that it is Qantas, Ansett, Hilton hotels and the Sheraton group. That is about as far as their vision goes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of the tourist industry is that 92 per cent of its composition consists of small businesses. Mums and dads are the backbone of the tourist industry in Australia. They are not the leeches of the industry; they are the entrepreneurs of the industry. They are the people who give the attractions to those who wish to visit Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the development of the tourist industry over the last 20 years, we see that there have been some amazing success stories. I remember that during my time at the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation in 1983 and 1984 we worked very hard to get Australian tourism promoted overseas. It was important to give a promotional campaign on Australia as a whole or on a state as a whole, but the reality is that we were absolutely dependent on the tourist operators in the regions to come with us to provide that promotion so that we had a few hooks with which to bring people to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, we have a very competitive world. The vision of Australian tourism in those early days was the reef, the rock and the Sydney Harbour Bridge&mdash;and they were big attractions. But we have developed the industry a lot further than that. The tremendous inflow of tourists we now have is purely because we have other infrastructures and operators in place. Those operators have helped to open up many regions of Australia to ensure that we get the maximum benefit from the flow of international visitors coming to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great success stories of those early days was an operator out of Port Douglas in Far North Queensland called the Quicksilver Connection. It was a family business, and that family poured everything it had into a catamaran that ran out to the Great Barrier Reef and provided one of the most incredible diving experiences that could be had anywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the family involved in the Quicksilver Connection was very dependent on the export market development grants scheme. If it had not been for EMDG, they probably would never have got there. I have been involved in a couple of the major international trade shows such as ITB in Berlin or JTB in Tokyo and I know that, without the assistance of EMDG, it is very doubtful whether an operation such as Quicksilver Connection would ever have got off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we now have out of Cairns? Quicksilver Connection has been bought out by a major international operator and now has a fleet of about five boats, and there are also three or four other operators in the same business. It has been one of the greatest attractions that the Far North Queensland area has had for international visitors. There are dozens of stories like that all around Australia and in the far-flung parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great challenges the tourist industry now has is that, while we have made this tremendous initial impact, we have to keep going if we are going to not only maintain the numbers but increase the numbers. With the changing nature of tourism in Australia there are some enormous opportunities to open up new districts and new areas. My friend the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who is at the table, will tell you that probably the next great area of Australia to open up to international visitors will be the north-west of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of natural attractions, there are probably very few other places in the world that are as spectacular as this part of Western Australia. There is very little infrastructure there at all, but the infrastructure is starting to come in. It is not coming in with the Sheratons and the Hiltons of this world; it is coming in with small operators, small investors, people who know how to innovate and people who know how to sell. But, as so often happens, they are restricted in their capital and, if you are going to play in an international market, you need some big dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle the government has in the Australian Tourist Commission's promotion is right. The Australian Tourist Commission operates as an umbrella over the entire industry. Its sole purpose in life is to attract people to Australia. It does it as an umbrella operation; it does not single out a particular area necessarily. It certainly does not single out a particular business. That is done by the individual operators themselves or in consortia through the Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia, and that is the way it should be. As I said, the real innovators in this industry are the small business operators. They are 92 per cent of the business and they are the people that the opposition's amendments are designed to help and designed to get overseas so that they can promote Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing the government does not realise is that there is a changing nature in tourism. It is happening virtually every day of the week. There is some aspect of the industry that has to be updated and there is some new attraction that can come on line. If you look at an analysis of what has happened in the tourist industry in Australia in the last 15 years, you would see how our industry has progressed. Initially, we were looking for bulk tourism. I suppose to be more definitive, we were looking for Japanese tourists. Yes, they came in their numbers and they centred themselves to a very great extent on Sydney and the Gold Coast. There was nothing wrong with that. It was one way of getting the industry opened up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second wave was to go into North America, after <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crocodile Dundee</EMPHASIS>. That worked too. Those tourists were probably a little bit more adventurous because it was at that time that Far North Queensland came on line. Then this thing that the government has just discovered, ecotourism, came into being. Ecotourism was a major attraction from about 1984 or 1985. It was the small operators who realised the potential of that, who went overseas on these delegations, who went to these trade shows, who spent their money and who made that investment to get those things starting to happen and to come off. We know the success story of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going through another phase at the moment, that of the independent traveller, more euphemistically called the backpacker. Fifteen years ago if you asked people what the definition of a backpacker was they would tell you it was somebody who came into Australia with a clean T-shirt and a $10 note in his or her pocket and while here changed neither. The backpacker now is the biggest spender in the tourist industry. The average backpacker is worth about $5,500 a head while in Australia. Backpackers are not staying at the Sheratons or the Hiltons; they might spend a day or two having a look around a capital city but the reality is that they are going out into the far-flung parts of Australia. They are going out and spending their money in a direct sense in many of the regional communities of Australia and they are helping local economies and creating local employment. Backpackers are not going near the big operators; they are going to the small, innovative operators, the people we are trying to make sure get the full benefit of the export market development grants through the amendments in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that at least in the House of Representatives, when the vote is finally taken on this, there is going to be a realisation of just what our amendments mean in terms of the future of the tourist industry and a realisation of the absolutely essential nature of these amendments to make sure that we continue to grow and that the small operators&mdash;the innovators of the industry&mdash;have the capacity to get overseas and to promote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does cost a lot of money to go overseas and promote. If you look at the $80 million that the Australian Tourist Commission has been allocated this year, you can see why that sort of money is required. You can see what is going to be spent on television campaigns in places like Japan, where one television ad can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for a minute, or in the United States; and you can see the difficulty that the Australian Tourist Commission might have in promoting around Europe, because of the diversity of language and the diversity of the media there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is fine. That is what the ATC is all about. But it is very much going to be up to the little operators within the industry to go out and really sell the sizzle that is the Australian tourist industry. My recommendation to government members opposite would be to please accept these amendments. They are equitable, they are a good investment in Australia, they are a good investment in export income for us, and, most importantly, they are a magnificent investment in jobs for young Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Export Market Development Grants Amendment (No. 2) Bill arose out of policies announced by the government in the Working Nation white paper more than 12 months ago. At that time the government confirmed its commitment to place a high priority on facilitating export growth by equipping Australian firms with an excellent export market intelligence network providing targeted financial assistance to new exporters and by promoting the growing export culture across Australian industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That statement of policy, of course, underscores this legislation and the government's continuing support for the export market development grants scheme. In the Working Nation white paper, the government further announced that the effectiveness of export programs for small and medium sized exporters, which often have significant cash flow and financial constraints at the early stages of exporting, would be extended by several provisions, and these feature in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first change is to expand the export market development grants scheme to provide export marketing assistance to single-service tourism operators. This recognises the significance of the tourism industry to export growth. Those matters were addressed quite capably, as is his style on tourism issues, by the member for Fadden (Mr Jull). The second is to examine the extension of the scheme to other key service sector exporters in the course of 1994-95 in the light of the findings of the LEK services study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third provision&mdash;and it is reflected in this legislation&mdash;is to continue the scheme for a further five years, thereby providing assistance to approximately 5,000 exporters a year at a cost of $231 million in 1994-95. That would increase to just under $300 million by the 1997-98 financial year. The fourth change announced in Working Nation was to assist offshore marketing activities by providing low interest loans through the international trade enhancement scheme for a further four years at $50 million per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of those provisions are reflected in this legislation. So the bill is acting on the policies announced in the Working Nation white paper. It is also consistent with the government's non-interventionist approach to industry policy. Non-interventionist approaches recognise the futility of industry or sector planning in an economic environment which features rapid movements in capital, dynamic shifts in competitiveness and trade capacity across advanced economies and rapid changes in technology. Much of the technology, particularly in the information area, has moved outside national boundaries and challenges governments to find appropriate forms of national regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The non-interventionist approach recognises that with rapid changes in capital movements, shifts in trading capacity and changes in technology it is not possible for a government to plan ahead for a period of, for example, five years in the medium term and expect that its planning assumptions would hold true throughout that period. In a dynamic economy it is rather futile for governments to embrace and endorse a style of interventionist sector planning for industry. Rather, there is a need for government to adapt to a rapidly changing economic environment by developing rapid response policy instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years, we have seen the growing redundancy of slow response policy instruments not only in Australia but also in most advanced economies. It is this approach towards the legitimate tools of government in industry policy, a preference for rapid response policy instruments to cope with the rapidly changing economic environment, that underscores the federal government's industry policy and trade strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need to have a rapid response to clearing blockages to market entry, in the information available to new market entrants or in developing exporters, to clear blockages in the availability of capital for new industries, new companies and a new and emerging export potential in Australia, features in this legislation. The policy and framework for industry policy is about rapid responses, to enable firms&mdash;those firms that are not born globally but rather born locally&mdash;to develop the critical mass needed in their information, capital capacity, training capacity and research and development capacity to develop their competitiveness and move from trading in the domestic market to trading in overseas markets and improving Australia's export performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These areas are underscored by the government's active commitment to micro reform to make the economy more efficient, to lower the cost of doing business, to lower the cost of business inputs and create the sort of flexible environment in which businesses would best conduct their trade. This is the approach the government has adopted&mdash;to rely on rapid response policy instruments and to have trade and industry policies in place which encourage locally born firms to develop the critical mass needed to trade effectively overseas. The government underscores that with a very effective set of micro reform policies which lower the costs of doing business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the House to the Working Nation white paper. Page 51 provides a very useful statement of the government's philosophy&mdash;this non-interventionist approach&mdash;and the sort of economic and trading environment with which we are seeking to deal. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firms today operate in a radically different environment to that of 20 years ago. At the broadest industry level, modern telecommunications and transport systems have revolutionised the mechanisms for doing business, and have internationalised markets as diverse as finance and horticulture . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Product lives are shorter and goods and services are more elaborate, skill intensive and customer specific . . . Innovation, encompassing all business activities from research and development, to marketing, management and industrial relations, has become critical. The successful players are flexible and innovative, increasingly small and medium enterprises (SMEs), operating against a backdrop in which competition is intense and capital highly mobile.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most successful firms worldwide are those that have adopted a long term view in developing their business strategies. Their focus is on continual improvement and the need to develop new processes, products, skills and markets in response to rapidly changing patterns of demand and heightened competition. Attention to skill formation, customer requirements and investment in new equipment, knowledge and processes&mdash;the dynamics of economic growth&mdash;is the key to their success.</PARA>
<PARA>That was an outstanding statement and shows the government's approach to industry policy with the development of an export based culture of economic activity throughout the country. That is one of the main features of the export market development grants scheme, which is the subject of this legislation. It is apparent that any government support which is used by industry as a de facto subsidy and which industry comes to rely on would be a counterproductive practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In schemes such as this, the government needs to strike a balance&mdash;a balance between encouraging industry to upgrade, become more innovative and develop skills, training, export capacity and research and development without using government support and subsidies as a source of reliance, which would result in the underpinning of profit margins. Any business or economy which relies on subsidies would find that this dulls innovation, negates the need to upgrade, negates skill development and diminishes the continuous improvement model that underscores economic success in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government needs to find the balance and have effective performance measures in place that provide a guide to whether or not the grants are being used effectively. The subsidies might become counterproductive and form a de facto system of reliance and dependence, and industry may lose the very important incentives to innovate and upgrade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My interest on the subject of the correct balance between innovation and reliance arose from a question I placed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>&mdash;question No. 2320 directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade (Mr Bilney)&mdash;in relation to the export market development grants scheme. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What are the details of export development grants paid by Austrade to companies in the: (a) clothing, textile and footwear, (b) automobile, (c) music, and (d) shipping industries, in (i) 1992-93, (ii) 1993-94, and (iii) 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, for the last three financial years. My interest in this stems from the fact that each of those four industry groups in Australia are heavily import protected by international standards. The answer to that question&mdash;which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday 20 June&mdash;should be of great interest to the House. It showed that protected industries in Australia are substantial recipients of export development grants. In 1993-94 the textile, clothing and footwear industry received 111 grants to the value of more than $6 million; the automobile industry received 64 grants to the value of more than $4 million; the music industry received 11 grants to the value of about half a million dollars; and the shipping industry received 16 grants to the value of $850,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993-94 the aggregate of those four industries was 3,277 grants at a value of $195 million, which represented 6.2 per cent of all the grants that were awarded under the export development grants scheme and six per cent of the value of those grants. This reinforces the point that the export development grant scheme should be used as a performance measure by which the government can gauge the success of its import protection policies. It also raises the issue that these industries are competitive enough to enter overseas markets&mdash;that is why they are receiving grants&mdash;yet overseas firms, under other aspects of government policy, are restricted from entering Australian markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the vernacular, that would be regarded as `good work if you can get it': a business is import protected on one part of the market but receives export development grants for its overseas efforts. Some of these industries and companies are burning the candle at both ends. They are import protected and receiving what amounts to a consumer subsidy because of the tariffs, yet they are also export subsidised. This further reinforces the point that industry protection works to protect capital and profits, not necessarily jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also reinforces the point that industry protection is a fairly blunt instrument because obviously among the TCF, automobile, music and shipping industries some internationally competitive firms are taking advantage of the export market development grants scheme. They are competitive, but there must be laggards in their industry that demand some level of import protection. So import protection, by its very nature, is insensitive to the diversity and various levels of competitiveness that would be apparent in any industry at any one time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should use this information and this scheme as a means of measuring the performance and effectiveness of its import protection policies. There may be an argument to say that, if firms are competitive enough to export&mdash;that is, their international competitiveness is high&mdash;they do not require a high level of import protection at the other end of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that the government has placed the export market development grants scheme under scrutiny and there has been a performance assessment of the scheme. The major amendments proposed by this bill give effect to the recommendation of the 1994 evaluation of the scheme entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Helping to meet the export challenge</EMPHASIS>. The key findings and recommendations of the evaluation were that the scheme is achieving its objective of encouraging firms to seek out and develop export markets; revenues from taxes on grant receipts and profits on additional exports were estimated to return 42 per cent of the cost of the scheme to the Commonwealth, so there is a good element of cost recovery in this scheme; most of the growth in the scheme has come from the services sector, and that is acknowledged in this bill by extending the grants to the tourism industry&mdash;a very important part of the Australian services sector; the minimum level of qualifying expenditure, the grant rate, number of grants and performance tests were judged to be largely appropriate; the number of firms claiming grants and then dropping out of the scheme is not ideal; the scheme should be extended to all claimants in the tourism sector; and the scheme should be extended for another five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, based on the performance appraisal entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Helping to meet the export challenge</EMPHASIS>, the government and the House can be confident this scheme is working well, which is my point. I come back to the answer provided by the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) that the scheme is working well and that certain companies may not require the import protection they have been afforded in the past and are scheduled to receive in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tariff reduction programs combined with export enhancement grants schemes such as this have a very important and beneficial effect on industry. For instance, between 1991 and 1994 the average effective assistance from protection to producers of motor vehicles and parts was reduced from 48 per cent to 38 per cent. Producers noted that by the year 2001 the rate will be down to 19 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Car manufacturing companies have responded by instituting major improvements in productivity, with the result that the time taken to build a car at assembly plants has fallen by about one-third since 1990&mdash;that is, from 52.5 hours in 1990 to just 34.5 hours in 1993. Productivity gains were an outstanding 31 per cent for 1992 and 1993 alone. The quality of Australian cars has also improved. The best Australian cars had in 1993 achieved quality levels better than some imported Japanese vehicles, as measured by owner identified faults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again in relation to the performance measure on improved productivity and competitiveness, those same automobile manufacturers are receiving for 1994-95&mdash;the current financial year, which is not yet complete&mdash;50 grants under the export market development grants scheme to a value of $2 million. Tariff reductions and export enhancement for the textile, clothing and footwear industries have also produced massive improvements in productivity and competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the trade minister, in his own magazine which is aptly named <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">trade blazer</EMPHASIS>, reflected on the success of the textile industry in generating export revenue. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994, the textile industry generated more than $400 million in export revenue, almost triple the level of just six years earlier.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is particularly encouraging to see export growth in one of Australia's sophisticated manufacturing industries&mdash;in this case using the latest in technology and management skills to add value to high quality Australian fibres.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, this is a good measure of the success of the export enhancement scheme and also how lower import protection is a very strong incentive for industry to become more competitive and more productive. Some of these arguments could be used by the government to revise its schedule for the phased reduction in tariffs on manufactured goods, especially in light of these export performance levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, it is true to say that in recent decades the only advances in economic thought and analysis have been by empiricists&mdash;those willing to use the methods of observation and experience in their assessment of economic institutions, technology and culture. These studies are focused on an understanding of the tools of national competitiveness in an international trading environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the House to the work of Michael Porter, Robert Reich and Paul Romer&mdash;Romer being one of the new growth theorists producing some outstanding work in the United States. In relation to export enhancement, their work shows that nations succeed in certain industries because the corporate environment is dynamic and challenging, pressuring firms to build and widen their advantages over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competitive advantage of nations comes from industrial upgrading and continuous improvement. New investment, technology, knowledge and skills give companies a competitive edge on world markets. This again confirms the basis of an export culture in Australia. The basis is to bring the tools of competitiveness close to firms and recognise that sector planning and grossly interventionist industry policies in a dynamic economy are essentially futile, and, further, that government interventions, where needed, should be based on rapid response instruments which help firms in capital formation, training, skill development and the critical mass needed to jump from domestic to export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of an export culture is to bring the tools of competitiveness close to the enterprise&mdash;that is, to make sure that each enterprise in Australia, as it eyes off international markets, has the industrial relations capacity, the training and the research and development within its own hands to upgrade its level of productivity and competitiveness and penetrate export markets effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most areas the government has the agenda right. In some aspects of training and management, reflecting on the findings of the recent Karpin report, more needs to be done. Continuous reform is necessary to bring the tools of competitiveness within the reach of every enterprise in Australia, particularly those with export potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, and in conclusion, this is a good scheme enhanced by the legislation, consistent with the government's correct philosophy and approach to industry policy. I look forward to further measures by the trade and industry minister to build on these achievements and make the Australian economy even more effective in export performance and even more internationally competitive. </PARA>

To the extent that we are talking about export enhancement in this debate, I do not disagree with a lot the member said but I do strongly agree with him that much more needs to be done and can be done, but in fact has not been done, by this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every day we point out the government's deficiencies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not so much a debate about economics&mdash;though I agree with most of the member's economics. Very clearly the issue in this debate is equity, not economics. We on this side of the House would like to hear from government speakers&mdash;perhaps the member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), who will follow me in this debate, will enlighten us&mdash;why the government is, by virtue of this legislation, discriminating against the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have moved and had carried in the Senate amendments to this legislation which will provide equal treatment for the tourism industry as far as the EMDG scheme is concerned. This legislation quite simply and blatantly&mdash;and I assume for the purpose of saving what would amount to a very small amount of money&mdash;discriminates against the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one whose electorate is based in a tourism area and the economy of which is wholly reliant on the tourism industry, I object to this proposal. I take this opportunity to point out that the test will come when this bill is voted on in the House of Representatives. The opposition's amendment, which seeks to provide equity for the tourism industry in relation to the EMDG scheme, was carried in the Senate. It is now up to the House of Representatives to deal with that amendment. The bottom line is that when we vote on this amendment it will be clear to the tourism industry in Australia who supports tourism and who does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure members of the government that those in the tourism industry are watching their performance with respect to this issue because it boils down to who supports the tourism industry and who does not. I am proud to stand in this place and say that the opposition strongly supports the tourism industry&mdash;we believe in tourism. We do not see much of the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee), but he pays lip-service to the tourism industry. When it comes to the crunch, he is unable to deliver on something as fundamentally important as the recognition of tourism as an export industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry wants that recognition. That is what a lot of the debate has been about. Tourism needs to be regarded as a fully fledged export industry. If it is recognised as such  then there can be no argument for discriminating against it in respect of the EMDG scheme. I challenge the member for Reid and other government members who will be speaking in this debate to tell us why the government is not prepared to provide the tourism industry with the same access to the EMDG scheme as it provides for all other export industries in Australia. That is ultimately what this debate is about. We want to hear from the government why it will not give the tourism industry the same treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current EMDG scheme provides for grants to reimburse 50 per cent of eligible expenditure incurred above $15,000, subject to a minimum expenditure of $30,000 and a maximum grant of $250,000, which is to be reduced under this legislation to $200,000. We support that aspect of the legislation. Why is the extension of this scheme, which the tourism industry has been arguing and fighting for for many years, going to provide eligible single-service tourism providers a grant of only 25c in the dollar, within the broad eligibility criteria, when other exporters are entitled to 50c in the dollar?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there some rationale for that proposal other than what we heard in the Senate that the tourism industry is getting enough support or something along those lines. It is true that direct government support for the tourism industry has grown. I think the government's contribution to the Australian Tourist Commission has grown to around $100 million a year. We are certainly in favour of that assistance and acknowledge that that assistance is valued. But why is it that single-service tourism operators are going to get only 25c in dollar whereas all other exporters are entitled to 50c in the dollar. When we vote on this legislation we will see whether the government is prepared to accept the amendment that was carried in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been said about the tourism industry so far in this debate. Australia can be justifiably proud of this industry. It has grown consistently over the years, but largely despite the government. The government cannot claim much credit for what has happened in the tourism industry. As the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) rightly pointed out, the tourism industry has grown on the backs of a large number of small businesses in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see through the sheer hard work and dedication of some people in my electorate that many small businesses have recognised that Australia has something very special to offer as a tourism destination and that parts of Australia, such as the Gold Coast, have something particularly special to offer to Australians in terms of holidays. Even your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, on the north coast of New South Wales, has some wonderful tourist attractions. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry has grown very quickly and, as I said, that is pretty much because of the efforts of a large number of small businesses and a lot of people who are very committed to making this industry work. We have a wonderful product to sell both to Australians who can see their country and to overseas visitors who are coming here in increasing numbers. On that point alone, the average annual rate of growth of overseas visitors is projected to be 11 per cent per annum between now and the year 2000. The projections, which are quite conservative in many respects, show that Australia will actually have 6.3 million overseas visitors by the year 2000. That is a very good rate of growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing is that the tourism industry is labour intensive. At a time when we need employment it employs between half a million and a million Australians, depending on how you measure the industry. Many of those Australians that the industry employs are young Australians. Therefore, it is a very good industry which should be encouraged. In my electorate, many young people are working in the industry. For many it is their first job. Many young people are now going into the industry straight out of university because it offers such excellent employment prospects for people who have formal academic tertiary qualifications in some aspect of the tourism-hospitality industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This industry is a good employer and it needs to be encouraged. It has never sought much and it has never got much. But our argument today is about this small differential. It might cost the government only a small amount of money, but it says a lot about why the industry is being treated poorly compared with other export industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry contributes as much as 11.5 per cent of Australia's GDP, depending on how you measure it. It brings in about $11 billion of overseas earnings each year. It pays $3.6 billion a year in indirect taxes alone. In every respect it is a very important industry to Australia, and the future prospects of the industry are also very good. Therefore, it deserves our full support. </PARA>

It does have a fair bit to say about the export market development grants scheme. It talks a little bit about the history of the scheme as far as tourism is concerned. Importantly, tourism was eligible for assistance under this scheme and a subsequent scheme from 1978 to 1987, but for some reason it was excluded by the government in 1987&mdash;perhaps as a way of saving money. But the industry was partially readmitted to the scheme in July 1990. Since then the EMDG scheme has been open to tourism operators who provide three or more prescribed tourist amenities. That was a complication with the scheme, but it did exclude the single-service operators to whom the government now plans to extend the scheme.

It recommended that the tourism provisions of the export market development grants scheme be extended to the rest of the tourism industry with effect from 1 July 1992 and that the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 and the associated regulations be amended.

The banking committee recommended that, once the export market development scheme had been fully implemented, consideration be given to the provision of equal access to the scheme for single-service providers at the rate of 50c in the dollar. I hope that the government will act on that recommendation. </PARA>

As I said, he covered that broad expanse of issues. He made comments that governments have no role other than as facilitators. He lampooned or attempted to lampoon the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his role on the international stage. In general, he came to the point of view that these kinds of grants are really very undesirable and, really, it is very unfortunate that we have them.

Until now, there has been a requirement that operators in this service sector provide at least three of those facets of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, and anyone who looks at this industry rationally, says that the vast majority of tourists who come to this country come here because they are attracted to a diverse range of possibilities.

They are coming to Australia because it provides a range of opportunities, a range of attractions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ridiculous to say that there should not be any differentiation in this industry. We know that already there is differentiation in the operation of the act in the service industries&mdash;and perhaps this is something that should be reviewed again&mdash;as opposed to manufacturing. In the service industries it has to be specifically designated whereas in manufacturing, where there is over a 50 per cent local manufacturing contribution, it is mandatory that they are eligible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mainstream economists attribute all such successes to a `freeing-up' of the market, to the pressures induced on business by the great deregulatory steam train. There is possibly an element of truth in this; yet the relation between these `new' exports and government support is indisputable. All these packages have been developed pragmatically for specific reasons dictated by industry-specific balance of forces, and they all lie outside the conventional economic wisdom entrenched in the dominant policy vision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one in Canberra has extrapolated from these particulars to the general principle. At the slightest sign of improvement in the current account, the government goes into `she'll be right mate' mode, proclaiming that the fundamentals are in place, and it's full steam ahead to current account utopia.</PARA>
<PARA>This particular scheme, as I say, has been the subject of a number of inquiries. It was covered by the industry, science and technology committee. It was also, as noted by previous speakers, the subject of the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Helping to meet the export challenge</EMPHASIS>, wherein a number of recommendations and a number of analyses were made of the scheme. The report said of the scheme:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government note that the EMDG scheme is achieving its objective of encouraging firms to seek out and develop export markets and that quantifiable, positive results flow through to the balance of payments from additional exports achieved . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The broad thrust of that report was positive towards the effect of the scheme. In regard to tourism it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . taking into account the inter-relationship between generic and specific tourism promotion, and because there is an element of promotion directed at a "captive market"&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which I referred to earlier&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government may wish to consider applying a lower grant rate to tourism companies which would become eligible to claim. If so, the Government will need consider whether the lower grant rate should also apply to those tourism operators which are currently eligible under the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>So that report was generally supportive of the success of the EMDG scheme and also said that perhaps there was some need to make a distinction in regard to how the EMDGS applies to the tourism industry, which the government is now attempting to do. The report also noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Revenues from taxes on grant receipts and profits on additional exports achieved are estimated to return 42% of the cost of the scheme to Government.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the kind of thing we have to see out of this. We have to see that there is some relationship between the government granting money and what Australia, industry and employment gain from the money; not just, as has been put, that it is discriminatory and wrong because everyone should get the same go at taxpayers' money. We have to ask whether it will have the effect desired. We have to make sure that there is a dollar return and that it is clearly interrelated; not just that tourism is growing, is producing jobs and is a worthwhile employer. There has to be an indication that this devotion of government money is achieving the results intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, at the moment the legislation does distinguish clearly between the service and manufacturing industries, but that particular analysis of the EMDGS noted that much of the growth in the scheme has come from the service sector, despite the fact that it is not treated in the same fashion. The report further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major scheme parameters, such as the minimum level of qualifying expenditure, the grant rate, number of grants and performance test, are broadly appropriate and changes are not recommended. Certain adjustments are recommended to improve the scheme, without change to the major parameters.</PARA>
<PARA>Predictably, the Auditor-General has also reviewed the EMDG scheme. Page xviii of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit report No. 33</EMPHASIS> of 1993-94 noted that the EMDG scheme:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*achieves its objectives of encouraging firms to undertake export promotion which they would not otherwise have taken, and,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*in doing so generates export earnings in the order of $15-$20 for every $1 of grant for some categories of firms who have been in the scheme a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA>It further commented at page xiii:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme is under pressure to expand, to be better focused, to provide a better value-added customer service, to become more efficient and to be less subject to misuse, but the data which can indicate the impact of the scheme, or even the potential number of EMDG clients, are not available.</PARA>
<PARA>It further said at page 42:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as the scheme is narrowly defined and relatively isolated from other products, Austrade having decided that its resources are better focused elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA>We have had a series of reports which say that this scheme in broad stance is operating well and that it is returning to taxpayers a significant amount of money for the dollars spent. No-one is disputing for a moment the contribution of tourism; it might not be as passionate an issue for those of us who do not have an electorate dependent upon it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the submission presented by Tourism Council Australia to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration in its current investigation into visa policy. In it Tourism Council Australia noted its expectation that in 1994 in this country tourism would generate $58.5 billion in gross output, account for 11.7 per cent of gross domestic product, create employment for one million people and contribute $15.6 billion in taxes. It further predicted that by 2005 tourism in Australia would generate $107 billion in gross output and employ 1.2 million people. It also mentioned the expansion from 1980 when Australia welcomed just over 900,000 visitors to a tripling of that number by the end of 1993. It also noted the industry expectation that it might accomplish the Australian Tourist Commission target of 6.8 million visitors for the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indeed an industry, as both sides of the House have noted, that employs a large number of people, an industry that provides a significant amount of taxation and an industry that is also giving Australia a bigger dimension internationally. But it is worth noting that the motivation behind this current submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration is the issue of visa policy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest argument the industry has put in is that there is a prevailing trend in international tourism now that people decide in a shorter time span to make visits. They do not wait around as they previously did for months and months to plan visits; they do it in a very short time. This strengthens the argument even more for precision in this grant. It is even more the case that they are making a split-second decision to go to a country; they do not go on the basis of an advertisement about a particular hotel, a particular motor car company or a particular one-off tourist attraction. </PARA>

The industry, science and technology report notes on page xiii:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) not only is it inequitable to have one sector of the tourism industry eligible for assistance . . . and other sectors not, but it is also inequitable that exporters of manufactured goods and other service exporters are eligible . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) the exclusion of part of the tourism industry . . . will tend to encourage distortions in the allocation of investment resources.

<PARA>It further commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . marketing overseas by single tourism service providers may involve competition for market share, it cannot be assumed that it has little or no effect on the decision by tourists to visit Australia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difficulties in obtaining conclusive evidence of a causal link between the availability of government assistance for overseas market development and increased export revenues is something which must be dealt with when the EMDGS is next reviewed. Since it is not a difficulty which applies exclusively to the tourism industry . . . there is sufficient evidence for assistance to the tourism industry . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It further commented on page 30:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . anecdotal evidence&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">received by the committee through submissions from inbound tourist operators suggest that claimants have increased their expenditure on overseas promotions, entered into cooperative marketing with the ATC, opened overseas offices and entered new markets that would not have otherwise been possible in the same time frame.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is a degree of uncertainty as to the relationship between single-service providers and their advertising efforts. There is an argument that perhaps there is a degree of wasteful competition. There is an argument as to whether it has the effect claimed. I for one do not think that it is good enough to say&mdash;and this has certainly not been the thrust of opposition arguments on other matters&mdash;that, because one sector gets something, everyone else has to get on the wagon or get on the gravy train. This is a very different argument from those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other provisions in the legislation besides the substantive one we are arguing about. It opens up the applicability of the grants scheme to trade in South Africa after the recent momentous political changes there. It brings in some protections to try to ensure that there is not double-dipping by companies that are essentially part of the same corporation making a series of claims so that they are getting more than their fair share. It has penalties for a corporation of $50,000 and for an individual of $10,000 or five years imprisonment if they consciously seek to mislead as to the relationship between particular companies in the one operation in trying to claim more than their fair share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a calculation to be made in regards to companies which on the one hand are eligible tourist services and on the other are designated; in other words, the way moneys will be distributed between those that are single-service providers and those that provide a range of facilities. As I said, the essential thrust of the government's view is that they are undertaking different contributions to tourism in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, and this has been recommended previously, it makes departure taxes and visas eligible expenses in relation to the EMDGS. The 1994 Australian Trade Commission report, at page 39, commented that there was no good reason to allow the cost of international air travel and not associated airport departure taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I hope that the government will not agree to the opposition amendments. I feel that it is a reasonable response to say that yes, there may be a contribution by individual sectors, there may be something they are doing, but essentially people come to this country because of generic advertising, because of the much heralded and promoted efforts of the Australian Tourism Council. They come here to see the outback, the beaches or other things. That is why they are coming to this country. They are not coming to this country because a particular hotel puts an advertisement on television. I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1995. There are four major amendments proposed by the bill and three additional amendments that are now part of the bill. The former extends the life of the export market development grants scheme from 1994-95 to 1998-99, opens the way for single-service providers to claim eligibility, allows visa costs and departure taxes as eligible expenditure and limits related company groups to a maximum of $250,000 per year. The three other amendments are those that flowed from the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Undersold overseas</EMPHASIS>, and include a provision to enable the tourism industry to form joint ventures and consortia, a provision to enable the cost of samples provided by the tourism industry to be accepted as eligible promotional expenditure and a provision to increase the grant rate in respect of designated tourism services to 50c.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unfortunate fact is that, notwithstanding that the recommendations of the committee were bipartisan, the government, now the time has arrived for it to give these recommendations the tick, has just blithely rejected them. The export market development grants scheme provides a helping hand to Australia's export businesses, a helping hand that would probably not be necessary if the economic settings for this country were right. Instead, we have a taxation system that has exceeded its use-by date, a cut and paste of labour relations and a matrix of infrastructure services that for too long have hidden gross inefficiencies and contributed to overheads with which Australian export industries must contend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What these costs have done collectively is to override Australia's international competitiveness. Such are the levels of costs and charges that Australian businesses are confronted with that we are having considerable difficulty in maintaining market share in our immediate region, and in fact in some markets we are going backwards. While I am on the subject of loss of market share, let me note the contribution that our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is making in this regard. In August 1993 he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When we brought the Corporate rate down from 49 per cent to 39 per cent, it was for that express purpose&mdash;to keep us competitive with the countries of the OECD and some in our region. You do look to see what the competitor country is doing and you make sure that your industries are on an equal footing. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the words of the Prime Minister himself. Which members of the OECD or which of our regional neighbours have increased their company taxes from 33c to 36c? How has this increase in company tax helped our competitiveness?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August last year, the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) said at the opening of what the government likes to describe as its pre-eminent conference on trade and investment, the national trade and investment outlook conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past decade Australia has undergone an economic transformation . . . 90 per cent of our manufacturing companies . . . do not export to any significant extent.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a transformation. The fact is that Australia's exporters have fallen into such a hole in terms of urgency that it is necessary to bail them out. The sad thing about it is that the government appears not to know how to go about resuscitating Australia's export performance. It is bereft of ideas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is bereft of ideas to the extent that the government's trade policy, recently launched by the Prime Minister at the international conference on small business, drew a telling comment. Someone at the meeting, presumably from Australian small business, asked when they would see the final policy document. What did the Prime Minister launch? Obviously he launched the first draft. There is nothing in that document that would offer comfort to small business. Why? Because you cannot launch something like a trade policy without first making sure that the domestic economic settings have been addressed. Without a shadow of a doubt, the government, through its macro-economic settings, has become the Pol Pot of the Australian business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point about the first draft is that the government's policy on APEC remains incoherent. The coalition has been strongly supportive of APEC and has been bipartisan on anything to do with APEC issues. We believe that the leader's declaration at Bogor, committing the region to non-discriminatory trade liberalisation, was the way ahead for APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We took some comfort that the government supported the same principles, but it is not so. The region has been thrown a pup by this government, which has got behind the United States and is now pursuing some shonky discriminatory trade agenda that is totally out of step with the rest of the region. The trade minister then has the gall to question the motives of the shadow minister for trade, who quite rightly challenged the government on the grounds that there had been a policy shift that had major implications for the whole region. Clearly, this new agenda is at odds with the rest of the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not stop at the regional policy incoherence. Last Friday our trade minister, leaving aside the fact that he was to announce the government's trade policy, delivered an address to the National Press Club on the imbalance of Australia's trade with the United States. It is a matter of record that the government has been dealing with the United States, unfortunately with little tangible result, in an effort to influence the US to drop subsidised dairy produce and grain into Asia on the dairy export incentive program and on the export enhancement program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister informed his audience that the United States is blocking Australia's trade to the tune of $1 billion. He highlighted, and rightly so, the disparity in trade policy with Japan and the US policy towards Australia. His own department released figures showing that Australia's exports to the US had declined by over 20 per cent over the last five years. What he does not say is how Australian business regains a greater market access. Where are the strategies that will make this happen? It is fine to draw attention to the situation, but there is no policy coherence that will deliver outcomes. It becomes all a matter of hot air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making my final comments on the bill, I have two things to say. Firstly, the level of consultation with the recipients of the scheme, especially those affected by the reduction in the amount of $250,000&mdash;namely, company groups&mdash;was, judging from the representations made to the coalition, appalling. Nevertheless, we are prepared to accept the proposals providing it can be shown that no group participant will be affected. Secondly, I make the observation that, while welcoming the inclusion of single-service providers, there is a distinction in grant rates between these applicants and all other applicants that are in receipt of the grant of 50c in the dollar. I raise that in the interests of consistency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Furthermore, in the interests of the tourism industry, a major revenue earner, I ask the government to accept, in the true spirit of bipartisanship, the other two amendments proposed in the bill. They deal with three things, as previous coalition speakers have said, including provision for the tourism industry to claim the cost of samples given away to overseas visitors. This is a very important aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just deviate here to show how silly the laws we make in relation to promotion of tourism sometimes are and how they can act against us. The Bundaberg Rum Distillery in my electorate gives samples to people in much the same way as people who go to wineries can sample the product. But the Bundaberg Rum Distillery has to pay excise on its samples. The sample is a product the distillery gives away freely. It is a product that promotes tourism in Australia. It is a sample that promotes one of Australia's best known products. Yet, for all that, with no sale taking place, the product is still subject to excise. What we are saying in this legislation is that samples offered by the tourism industry to overseas visitors should become eligible for the export market development grant subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I would like to say&mdash;and I take umbrage at some of the comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson)&mdash;is that for some reason there is a belief that the tourism industry is `that other industry'; that group of industries that is glamorous and gets by on its own; that we do not have to worry about it, except to find all the reasons why it has captive markets and things like that; and that, for that reason, it should be deprived of subsidy levels available to other industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This industry employs the most Australians. This is our greatest export earner. This is the glamour industry around which we build such events as the coming Olympic Games, yet we treat it, in matters such as the export market development grant, as a second-class citizen. We say to this industry, `You can be part of the scheme, but at only 25c in the dollar.' Quite frankly, I do not think that is good enough, and I believe it sends out the wrong message to the tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all seen the international projections for tourism by the year 2000 and the year 2005. There is no guarantee that Australia's growth will increase on the same exponential curve it has in the past. There is no guarantee of that at all. Other nations are becoming smarter in their promotion. Other nations have seen how we have done it. Asia is freeing up in quite a dramatic way. We are not going to have to be the best; we are going to have to be better than the best. For that reason, the coalition amendment to have the subsidy raised to 50c in the dollar is only fair. It is the only way we can send out the right message to the tourist industry and ensure that we stay ahead in terms of the promotion of tourism in South-East Asia and the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to echo the words of the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) when he said that 92 per cent of all businesses in tourism are small businesses. To some extent, he has stolen part of my thunder in respect of regional tourism. Regional tourism has played an incredible part in the development of a national matrix of interstate, intrastate and overseas visitation. Australians cannot survive on sporting events, Sydney, Ayers Rock, the Gold Coast or Cairns alone. It is not that these are unimportant as major magnets in attracting people to Australia&mdash;they are vitally important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia depends on a range of diverse experiences to satisfy the international visitor. In reply to the previous speaker, let me say that I was never suggesting for a minute that people come here because of Avis car rentals, Hertz Rent A Car or the Sheraton Hotel. They come here because of diverse experience. For that reason, you have to take into account the whole matrix of tourism when looking at something like the export market development grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a manager of a regional tourism authority for 12 years and I never ceased to wonder at the contribution of small operators&mdash;not only to their own promotions but to promotions on a regional scale. That is part of the reason why you can travel from Melbourne to Cairns and go through so many marvellous areas, whether it be Coffs Harbour or the Gold Coast&mdash;and I am sorry that Deputy Speaker Nehl is no longer in the chair&mdash;</PARA>

For the entire journey&mdash;through the cane fields, the Barrier Reef and along the inland road&mdash;there is a diverse pattern. It is not just the great major resorts that hold the fabric together. A lot of little operators act jointly with their regional tourism authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland has 13 regional tourism authorities. I suppose you could say that four of them are in quite glamorous locations&mdash;Brisbane, Gold Coast, the Whitsundays and Cairns. But there are nine other authorities that hold the fabric of tourism together. If it were not for the regions, there would be a gross imbalance and gaps in the range of tourism product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These small operators that I have been talking about go to road shows&mdash;they go off in buses and promote&mdash;and attend trade shows, expos and sales interfaces with the industry. They are always sharing the cost of regional tourism promotion with the local tourism authorities. It seems to me that operators that are so motivated, so focused and so cooperative have earned the right to participate in overseas promotions. It is generally not recognised that few of these operators could participate in overseas promotions in their own right, let alone become eligible for an export market development grant in their own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's amendment goes some way to addressing the flaw in the government's program. It would be capricious of the government to force the withdrawal of this amendment. It is so important to allow two or three operators to get together. The government will be depriving a vast range of participants access to tourism markets if it throws this amendment out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also express a personal view that takes that vision a bit further. Perhaps this is a debate for another day, but I would like to touch on it briefly in the context of this debate. I believe that regional tourism authorities should be eligible for funding when they coordinate and participate in overseas promotions involving export market development grants and when other eligible individuals or companies are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government postures loud and long about regional development and regional economic development, yet the delivering body&mdash;the regional tourism authority, the body that state and federal governments rely upon for the delivery of programs, studies, submissions and coordinated promotions&mdash;is sidelined when it comes to something as fundamental as an export development grant. There seems to me to be an elementary lack of logic in this attitude. Frequently, the regional tourism authority is the very motivator of and originator of the away from home promotions. These promotions do not just happen. Certainly, you might get two or three promoters together&mdash;as the member for Fadden talked about with Quicksilver in North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those other nine regions, the organisation that pulls those small operators together&mdash;those operators might not be the big motels, the big attractions, the big services to the Barrier Reef or the big tour companies&mdash;is the regional tourist authority. It brings all those operators together, puts a promotional theme together, prepares the material and takes that promotion around the state or interstate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot for the life of me see why that same body which does so much motivating, so much originating and so much accessing on behalf of the industry should not be eligible for government export facilitation subsidies to take those smaller regions into the international market. What we would see out of that would be not so much groups of overseas tourists coming to specific spots in Australia, as indeed the Japanese do with the Gold Coast and various other groups do with Sydney and Ayers Rock; we would see a better spread of tourism up and down the east coast, into the north-west of Australia and to the southern states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the government to consider not knocking out the three amendments put up by the coalition and in particular to allow joint venturing as part of the export market development grants scheme. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), who is at the table and who comes from a regional area, conveys that to the minister. He would know the truth of what I am saying. I trust that he and others in the government will convey that to the minister and see that this very important scheme, which has been going since 1974, continues to function on behalf of not just the big players in Australian tourism but all players. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill for some of the same reasons already well described by my colleague the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) and my colleague the member for Fadden (Mr Jull). Being the shadow minister for small business, I know that 92 per cent of tourism businesses in this country, as the member for Fadden pointed out, are small businesses. On the regional development side, I support the member for Hinkler in that many of our regional areas today rely on the growth of tourism to sustain them through what has been a period of drought and difficulty for them. They have looked for new markets and have turned increasingly to developing tourism potential within those regions. So I have a particular interest in the amendment bill being debated today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export market development grants scheme was introduced in 1974-75. I think there lies a problem. In 1974-75, Australia was probably only just beginning to get a small inkling of its potential as a tourist destination. It has really been in the 1980s and the 1990s that we have seen a greater development of our potential as a tourist destination. The original export market development grants scheme was introduced in 1974-75 to encourage Australian firms to seek export markets for their products and to promote an export culture in the Australian business community. Those were days perhaps when Australia was more greatly focused on its resources, its manufacturing bases and its other areas of commerce but not so heavily attuned to the benefits of developing tourism in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill we are debating today proposes that the export market development grants scheme be extended for a fifth time, from 1994-95 to 1998-99. The coalition will support this extension but not before proposing some very sensible and important amendments to the government's bill to, as usual, improve the outcome for the business community and, I might say, deliver fairness and equity. I think it is quite wrong to make benefits available to some sections of the commercial community and not make them available to others. In this case, the tourism industry will miss out unless the government takes notice of what the coalition has said in relation to this and accepts the coalition's amendments to fully include the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export market development grants scheme currently provides taxable grants of up $250,000 per annum or $500,000 for approved trading houses and is based primarily on expenditure incurred by an Australian person or company seeking to create or expand exports of their products in overseas markets. Provided people have incurred at least $30,000 of eligible expenditure in a grant year, they are then entitled to a grant which is calculated at 50 per cent of eligible expenditure after the first $15,000&mdash;that is, unless their business happens to be a single-service tourism provider. Export market development grant claimants are limited to a maximum of eight grants, each one limited to a maximum of $250,000. Therefore, $2 million is potentially available for each claimant to promote and enhance the development of export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the period of 1992-94, approximately 5,750 export market development grants were paid totalling $376 million. These statistics highlight the number of successful applicants but, unfortunately, do not identify the number of companies that have found the process of applying for EMD grants either too complicated or out of their reach due to the impact of the threshold expenditure levels or, in the case of single-service tourism operators, do not identify their exclusion altogether from the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major amendments proposed by this bill give effect to the recommendations of a 1994 evaluation of the export market development grants scheme entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Helping to meet the export challenge: an evaluation of the export market development grants scheme and the international trade enhancement scheme</EMPHASIS>. The key findings of the recommendations in this evaluation were that the export market development grants scheme is achieving its objective of encouraging firms to seek out and develop export markets; revenues from taxes on grant receipts and profits on additional exports were estimated to return 42 per cent of the cost of the scheme to the Commonwealth; most of the growth in the export market development grants scheme has come from the service sector; the minimum level of qualifying expenditure, the grant rate, number of grants and performance tests are largely appropriate; the number of firms claiming grants and then dropping out of the EMDG scheme is not ideal; the EMDG scheme should be extended to all claimants in the tourism sector; and the EMDG scheme should be extended for a further five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major features of these amendments is to extend the reach of the export market development grants scheme to single-service tourism operators who are currently excluded from the benefits of the scheme. Altogether, until this time, they have not been part of that scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, despite the fact that the tourism industry is close to earning $12 billion a year in export earnings for Australia&mdash;more than the cumulative export earnings from iron ore, wheat, alumina, aluminium, sugar, and petroleum&mdash;single-service tourist operators are to be allowed to access the export market development grants scheme at only 50 per cent of the rate of all other individuals and companies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the government in this amendment bill is saying it now recognises and includes the tourist industry and the single-service tourist operator, and is going to include them in this scheme, it is only going to give them half of what other companies or individuals in Australia are entitled to. This is another example of this government treating small businesses as second-class citizens, given that 92 per cent of those businesses in the tourism industry are small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry has the capacity for further substantial expansion as a result of increasing market activity led by strong expenditure by overseas visitors to Australia. The flow-on benefits emanating from these visitors are not restricted to tourist ventures; all associated businesses and industries benefit. Not just the tourism sector benefits from the additional attraction of tourists into this country; there is a flow-on effect to many people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits of tourism are spread throughout the country because tourists have a habit of visiting friends, relatives and attractions throughout all areas of the Australian landscape. This is a wonderful way of redistributing income and benefits without the Labor Party's arcane methods of doing so. These amendments fail to remove the inherent discrimination against rural and regional tourist operators and small businesses who are, in many instances, unable to develop valuable export markets without the benefit of assistance in the developmental stage of export market development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Typical of the government's lack of foresight in promoting small business, the 1994 evaluation of the EMDG scheme, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Helping to meet the export challenge: an evaluation of the export market development grants scheme and the international trade enhancement scheme</EMPHASIS>, identified that revenues from taxes on grant receipts and profits on additional exports were estimated to return 42 per cent of the cost of the scheme to the Commonwealth, and that is significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that for every 17 overseas visitors, one additional Australian job is created. Many of the young people viewing the proceedings in this chamber today could be recipients of jobs in the tourism sector. The government should be extending, on a full parity basis, single-service tourism providers' access to this scheme, because they belong to the small business sector that, during the five years to May 1994&mdash;that was after the recession&mdash;created employment growth in Australia of 563,000 or 18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the same period, employment in big business and in government fell by 9.5 per cent and 7.2 per cent respectively. While government and big business were shedding jobs, small business was increasing its take-up of Australians into employment. Every dollar of EMDG assistance allocated is far more likely to generate maximum return from the small business sector than from other sectors of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed in this bill clearly illustrate that this government does not understand the intricacies of the operation of the tourism industry. The tourism industry is denied the right to include the cost of providing samples as part of eligible promotional expenditure. My friend the member for Hinkler has already given us a very good illustration of that. This is one anomaly that must be corrected to ensure that equity is maintained for all grant recipients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism is one of the most fiercely competitive industries in the world, with all countries attempting to maximise the number of people visiting and then ensure that their stay is as long as possible. As the member for Fadden rightly pointed out, it is not just the big hotels and big companies that are benefiting from this. By far the large majority of tourists to this country are spending in smaller establishments. This all adds up and is very important to our overall economic wellbeing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with any other export industry, the key factors of the tourism market are high quality products, available at competitive prices, with a focus on customer requirements. Each of these factors is critical to the success of the Australian tourism export market. Promotion is an integral and critical component of any export strategy. Our tourism industry has done an excellent job of promoting the intrinsic value of Australia's tourist attractions. Tourism growth did not just happen. It has come about as a result of intensive marketing by theme parks, resorts, hotels, tourism authorities, airlines, inbound tour operators&mdash;and the list goes on. For the government to exclude the cost of promotion of tourist attractions from eligibility for the EMDG scheme is both short-sighted and, in my view, inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments proposed by this bill will enhance the efficiency of the export market development grants scheme and enable the benefits of the scheme assistance to be available for a greater number of Australian exporters. The move to place a limitation of $200,000 per company group per grant year will ensure that available funds are widely distributed across a broader range of exporters. This amendment complements the access of exporters to only one of the range of Austrade assistance measures at any one time with respect to a specific project. This will overcome the propensity for some companies to double-dip across a range of Austrade schemes, thereby reducing the level of financial contribution from the exporter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar observation can be made of the budget decision to reduce the maximum grant payable from $250,000 to $200,000. The reduction of the maximum grant payable will ostensibly enable more small and medium sized enterprises to access the export market development grants scheme in any one year. As we have come to expect, the inconsistency of government decision making impacts in many perverse ways. The budget decision to increase the company tax rate from 33 per cent to 36 per cent will reduce the value of export market development grants by nine per cent, as all grants are taxable in the hands of recipients. It would be incorrect to assume that small and medium sized businesses in Australia are not affected by measures to increase company tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also created additional problems for those in our business community seeking export grants, by imposing additional tax measures on them. This is just another example of the government giving with one hand and taking with the other. As I have said many times in speeches relating to the budget, it is a bit of a pea and thimble trick: you see it here and it is taken away there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry sources state that the average sized export market development grant is approximately $60,000. On this basis, the increase in the company tax rate from 33 per cent to 36 per cent, which was announced during the budget, will reduce the level of funds available for export market development or recompense of expenses already paid from an average $60,000 by a further $5,400. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For companies that had previously been eligible for the maximum grant of $250,000, the impact of the budget decisions will result in, firstly, an increase in taxation of $22,500 per maximum grant&mdash;that is not an insignificant amount for a small business&mdash;and, secondly, a reduction of $50,000 or 20 per cent in the value of the export market development grant available. It is quite a significant reduction in the amount available. So much for this government's commitment to export development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other technical aspects of the bill which I wish to comment on briefly relate to the inclusion of departure taxes and visa costs as eligible expenses. This is an overdue amendment and is due recognition of the fact that these expenses are legitimate costs associated with export market promotion. The prevention of payment of grants to persons where they refuse to allow a search of criminal records for the purpose of the criminal conviction provision of the Export Market Development Grants Act is also a recognition of the fact that funds must be directed to companies and individuals of the highest probity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strengthening of the penalty provisions where a person provides false or misleading material or statements in support of a claim or for a grant will help to ensure that individuals and companies seeking export market development grant assistance do so on the basis of the provision of true and accurate supporting documentation, and that is critical. The repeal of the restrictive provisions relating to the proscribing of the Republic of South Africa for the purpose of the Export Market Development Grants Act recognises the changes that have occurred in the Republic of South Africa and correctly recognises that trade between South Africa and Australia is now being conducted to the benefit of both countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, another technical aspect of the bill that I wish to comment on is the introduction of more effective powers to prevent abuse where persons buy, sell, transfer or modify business undertakings in a manner which would make them eligible for grants in excess of the general grant limit. The nature of these technical amendments will tighten a number of existing provisions and lead to a greater degree of compliance with the broad provisions of the Export Market Development Grants Act. The coalition has already initiated a number of amendments to this bill in the Senate, and I support their inclusion in the bill. They are critical to the deliverance of equity to the tourist market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to raise a few other matters that are not covered by the amendments included in this bill. They relate to the complexity of the application process which needs to be simplified to allow easy access and entry into the scheme. These amendments do not address the large number of recipients of grants who, after receiving the first grant, subsequently drop out of the scheme. There is significant leakage of benefits to other firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to Austrade services, particularly the export market development scheme, by regional businesses is hampered due to difficulty in obtaining information and consultation with Austrade personnel who in many instances are located in either Canberra or Sydney or are restricted to capital cities. In conclusion, I would like to repeat the comments of the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) during his address on this bill. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is only because of the government's failure to implement balanced macro-economic policy and undertake fundamental reforms in the micro-economy that the scheme has continued to exist.</PARA>

I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to the measures announced by the Prime Minister last Friday in response to France's decision to resume nuclear tests. Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware that the Australian Ambassador to France, Mr Brown, had planned months ago to return to Australia this week and that Friday's announcement was nothing new? Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware that Senator Gareth Evans has been forced to concede, in the Senate today, that the French knew that the ambassador was returning to Australia on leave and for consultations this week? Can the Deputy Prime Minister also confirm that the senior Australian Defence Force representative in Paris was, in any case, scheduled to leave Paris altogether? Can the Deputy Prime Minister confirm that, while the government says there will be no Defence purchasing arrangements entered into with France, there was never any intention to enter into such arrangements over the next nine to 12 months? Has the government told the Left of the Labor Party that many of the measures announced last week were just hollow gestures and that they were likely to occur regardless of whether France resumed nuclear testing or not?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot confirm anything that the honourable member has incorporated in his question. I can confirm that I heard him yesterday on the radio saying that all those measures which he has some bowdlerised version of were measures that he fully supported and he thought that that was enough. When he was asked what else the government could do, he said, `Well, I don't really think there's anything else; that's really the end of the matter.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure the honourable member that the government thinks there is a great deal more that we can do. That is why the Prime Minister, in those announcements that he made on Friday, pointed to a whole series of steps which will be taken to mobilise opinion and activity in the South Pacific region to ensure that there is an effective protest continuing in a whole variety of international forums and directly to France with a view, in particular, to influence French public opinion, and that the government intends that there should be a continual stepping up of activity while the French intend to continue their testing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the honourable member has a very mistaken view about what the government's intentions are in this regard. He has a rather diminished and paltry view of what further things ought to be done to continue a campaign against French nuclear testing.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the member for Macarthur, I can say that I have seen claims that the tax measures proposed in the budget are bad for Australia. Those claims were made by the Leader of the Opposition last night on the ABC radio program, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will continue to oppose those four tax measures without modification because all those tax increases are bad for Australia and bad for individuals in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an interesting statement from the Leader of the Opposition because this is the first time, as far as I am aware, he has actually said that the tax measures themselves are bad policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time as he is saying they are bad for Australia, he and his deputy leader are saying that what this country needs is more tightening of fiscal policy. Whilst they are opposing these tax measures, they are saying that we need tighter fiscal policy, a larger budget surplus presumably, and in those circumstances they find themselves in a quite incongruous situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen this in respect of both sides of the budget. We have seen it on outlays where we were told before the budget by the Leader of the Opposition that if we came up with sensible expenditure cuts then there would be no opposition from those opposite. He said in a statement he made in the April edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Business Monthly</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say to the Treasurer now, `If you want to have substantial spending cuts in the May budget, you won't have any opposition from us unless you stray into areas of ridiculous sensitivity.'</PARA>
<PARA>So the first expenditure cut that comes up, which is the limitation of non-work related child care to 12 hours, gets opposed by the opposition, presumably because it is `ridiculous sensitivity'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is `ridiculous sensitivity' then I would hate to think how those opposite would go about making any expenditure cuts in other programs because that is a relatively easy expenditure cut to make, I must say. It is good, sensible policy to develop to ensure that we can reach our target of fully meeting other demand for work related child care by the year 2000. The combination of the resources going into the industry and this measure will enable us to do that. It is good, sensible policy, yet it gets opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen, in relation to revenue measures, the description of these revenue measures as bad policy, bad for Australia. The whole point of these measures is to tackle the issues that those opposite say are of concern to them and the whole nation&mdash;that is, the need to address the current account deficit and the need to take the pressure off interest rates. That is the point of the budget measures. That is the reason we moved straight away to surplus, with bigger surpluses in years thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To describe that as bad for Australia strikes me as an absolutely absurd statement and abundantly hypocritical when it is being said by a Leader of the Opposition who is standing for a tightening of fiscal policy. Let me make this challenge to the Leader of the Opposition: if he believes that this is bad policy, bad for Australians, then he should do what his deputy leader refused to do at the National Press Club when he was challenged in his speech there after the budget to say whether he would repeal those tax increases if he became Treasurer. He refused to give that commitment, and he was widely reported as having refused to give that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the opposition is trying to have it every possible which way saying, `These taxes are bad for Australia; we oppose them, but if they get through then we are going to keep them.' If the Leader of the Opposition thinks they are bad for Australia, then let him have the guts to say that if he became Prime Minister he would repeal those tax measures. Whilst he is doing that, he should also tell us how he would make up the revenue gap and what other measures he would put in place to ensure that there is a tightening of fiscal policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation in this country where the opposition is increasingly being exposed as hypocritical and without any sort of policy integrity in relation to general economic policy. How can you possibly have a situation where you are trying to stand for every side of the argument, saying, `We support tightening of fiscal policy,' while opposing the measures on the outlay side and opposing the measures on the tax side, saying, `They are bad for Australians and we will keep them anyway?' This is an opposition with no integrity  whatsoever. If those opposite want to have any semblance of integrity let them at least say that they would repeal those measures and tell us how they would make up for the revenue loss.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> entitled `Income splitting poses threat to tax revenue' describing income splitting as `regressive, sexist, inefficient, anti-saving and wouldn't even help families with children', according to tax academics at a seminar yesterday. One of those academics was Professor Apps from the University of Sydney, who concluded:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Income splitting would discourage women from working, would undermine saving and could exacerbate financing problems due to an ageing population.</PARA>
<PARA>Backing her view were two other women economists from the University of Sydney who argue that income splitting would make the tax system less efficient and would increase the gap between rich and poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting in those circumstances to note that this is a policy that the Leader of the Opposition has long expressed an interest in. Last year he was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> as saying that `the principle of income splitting is sound; it delivers equity to the tax system'. We all know he has been talking about this for quite some time. When he was Treasurer back in 1979 he flirted with that idea, and 16 years later he has not progressed any further except to say that he is still thinking about income splitting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He produced an article on this subject in January of last year in which he said that he was not wedded to income splitting; he was just flirting with it. Yesterday I noticed that there was a statement by his spokesman repeating the line that he was not wedded to it. After 16 years of flirting, you would have suspected he might be having a de facto relationship with it. Maybe he will tie the knot in his next headland speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If income splitting is going to become the opposition leader's formal family policy after all these years, then we need to remember the serious deficiencies of such a policy approach. The first is the sheer cost. Our calculation is that it would cost in the order of $3 billion. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is on record as saying he thinks it would cost some $3 billion. When the member for Mayo, the now spokesman on foreign affairs, was Leader of the Opposition he said he thought it would cost $9 billion. But, whatever the number is, it is certainly billions of dollars. It is a very expensive policy program, which raises the question of how you are going to pay for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of its deficiencies is that it is regressive. People on low incomes lose and people on high incomes win. For example, if you had full income splitting, a family on $20,000 would lose about $350 a year in disposable income while a family on $100,000 would stand to gain about $8,000. So you would be taking from the poor to give to the rich. It would also discourage women from taking up any work opportunities. Peter McDonald from the Australian Institute of Family Studies suggested in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in January last year that most married women earning less than $10,000 per annum would withdraw from employment because it would not be worth their while to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Apps said that tax rates would rise for women from 15 per cent to 36 per cent and for men they would fall from 26 per cent to 20 per cent. Yet the Leader of the Opposition seems to think this is fair on women. It also takes us backwards in family policy. The government has gone forwards through the direct family payments system over the last 12 years. It is very different from what it was in 1979. It is far more helpful to families and is a much better use of direct cash payments. We believe it is much better to go in that direction than to use the tax system as the basic means of helping families. Peter McDonald from the Australian Institute of Family Studies said also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the aim is to provide very large benefits to wealthy families and to make it very difficult for women to work part time, then income splitting is the right option.</PARA>
<PARA>After 16 years you might have thought the opposition leader would have worked that out.</PARA>

What is certainly true is that the level of interest rates today is lower than it was when the Leader of the Opposition bowed out as Treasurer.

There was going to be a tax on all building materials, plus an extension of the wholesale sales tax on all of these other items. We opposed that extension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the wholesale sales tax at that time, this meant that, in one blow, the then Treasurer was going to increase revenue under the wholesale sales tax by 42 per cent. He was going to do that in one go and at a time when the economy was going down the plughole and we were going into the worst recession in 60 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We stand by the action that we took at that time. It was the appropriate action because we were not being hypocritical. We were saying, `Your policy is wrong; you should not be tightening fiscal policy and we oppose it for that reason.' The opposition is in the utterly hypocritical position of saying to us, `You should be tightening fiscal policy, but we are going to oppose all your measures to do it.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members might be aware that to be debated in the Senate this week&mdash;if the Senate actually gets around to passing some legislation&mdash;is the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill. This is an important bill for improving the law relating particularly to small businesses in terms of removing unnecessary paperwork and constraints on the operation of small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Thursday, I will launch the Second Corporate Law Simplification Bill as an exposure draft. This is a much larger bill than the first and covers a great deal of the core company law areas in this country. It will touch on the reform of areas such as company formation, company names, company meetings and important rules dealing with share capital, accounts, audits and annual returns. With the completion of this stage of the corporations law simplification project&mdash;that is, the passage of the second bill&mdash;most of the core company law areas which impact particularly on small business will have completely gone through a process of simplification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that important program, the government's Justice Statement outlined a range of measures which are particularly directed at the operation of Australian business, as well as business obviously benefiting from the general measures dealing with improvements to the legal profession, the development of a national legal services market and the greater emphasis and support for the development of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One program was targeted at small business and its capacity to take legal action&mdash;the establishment of the national disbursement fund. This fund, unlike smaller funds which operate in the states, will be able to be accessed by corporations and small business. It will not be excluded in any way in terms of commercial law matters, which is often the way in which legal aid and similar disbursement funds operate at the state level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reform, together with changes to contingency fees, means that, if smaller Australian businesses are in dispute with a larger business and need to undertake certain expert reports and outlays in obtaining those expert reports, they will be able to access the contingency disbursement fund. This will be a major chance for small Australian businesses to have greater access to the legal system. This, combined with the improved corporations law system and the reforms to consultation with business which are hand in hand with the improvements to the way in which we make delegated legislation&mdash;which is of course where most of the regulation confronting business is to be found&mdash;is a comprehensive package to make our legal system operate better for small Australian businesses.</PARA>

In 1982-83 government revenue as a percentage of GDP was 26.0 per cent. In 1995-96 it will be 25.3 per cent.

It is very fortunate for members from both sides of this House who joined in supporting the initiative on the model criminal code that in fact that criticism is very much a minority view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Chief Justice, Sir Harry Gibbs, was very much instrumental in terms of the design of the way in which this new legislation has evolved. A number of other senior members of the judiciary&mdash;for example, Mr Justice Murray in Western Australia, who has also been involved in similar reform initiatives&mdash;are extremely complimentary of the process. That is not really surprising given that the process is one which has involved not only the Commonwealth but also almost all the other states in terms of the development through a working party, which has involved state and Commonwealth senior legal officers working together, along with the process of very extensive consultation with the private profession and all other interested groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absurd in a country such as Australia that if you cross a state boundary the principles of criminal responsibility and criminal law change, not merely the nature of the crimes themselves. We are working to harmonise that now not only with the agreement of the state attorneys but also with a commitment of the Prime Minister and all state premiers to reach the objective of harmonised criminal laws by the year 2001. In the Justice Statement that the Prime Minister launched with the Attorney-General and me, we committed ourselves to further funding of $800,000 so we could ensure those time lines were met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this House we have already passed the general principles of criminal responsibility legislation. That came into effect on 31 March. We will be moving through the process of making sure that all other Commonwealth criminal legislation is adapted to fit in with those principles. Two other stages will shortly be before the parliament: the first on crimes of theft, corruption and similar property offences and the second on violent crimes&mdash;issues such as murder, rape and the like. Those matters will be coming before the parliament, again having been through a process which involved the most detailed consultation possible.</PARA>

In fact, we had 10 per cent growth in the number of Japanese travellers coming to Australia in April. I am sure that we are all pleased about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures, together with the latest market intelligence from the Australian Tourist Commission, show that, despite the intense competition from Hawaii, the Kobe earthquake will probably not have the impact we expected on the number of Japanese travellers coming to Australia. This is very important given the number of questions from the opposition today relating to our balance of payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japanese tourists coming to Australia for holidays generated more than $2.8 billion in export earnings for Australia. Almost four out of every five Japanese travellers who came to Australia in 1994 went to Queensland during their holidays. With more than half a million Japanese tourists travelling to Queensland on holidays and spending money there they are responsible for creating a lot of jobs in the member's home state and, no doubt, in his electorate of Leichhardt. This is in no small measure due to the superb job that Bob Gibbs, the Queensland minister, and the QTTC do to market that state as a destination not just for travellers from Japan but for travellers from many other countries in the region. Most other state and territory tourist commissions are quite envious of the sums of money that the QTTC has to spend to promote Queensland in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that Australia continues to benefit from the export earnings that flow from the number of Japanese travellers coming to Australia, I can tell the House that in October this year the Australian Tourist Commission plans to hold a summit in Japan of leading figures involved in the tourism industry from both Australia and Japan.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members might also be interested in the Australian Tourist Commission's planned marketing campaign for the next three years, which will involve a total expenditure by the Australian government of over $100 million. The new advertisements, which are currently being filmed in locations right around Australia, will include one new advertisement for Japan. That will also help to broaden our market so that we are not just targeting honeymoon couples and young women. We will also be seeking to encourage more young Japanese people who are interested in an adventure holiday. No doubt they will often visit the honourable member's own region of Cairns. We are also trying to encourage more young Japanese families&mdash;perhaps couples as well as their kids&mdash;to make sure that we are encouraging more investment in the Australian tourism industry and creating more jobs.

Minerals and energy exports earnings are forecast to increase in both 1994-95 and 1995-96. They are forecast to rise by five per cent in 1994-95 to some $31.4 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forecast increase in both these years reflects higher export prices and volumes for minerals and energy commodities. Higher coal and iron ore contract prices negotiated in early 1995 will contribute strongly to higher sector export earnings in 1995-96. However, aluminium, gold and oil exports are also expected to increase strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hasten to inform the House that the Australian minerals sector is not by any means sitting on its hands, reaping windfall gains from these increases in mineral prices. The industry accounts for one-quarter of the total business investment in this country, and I am pleased to note that investment is forecast to grow strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New capital investment in the mining industry alone was $5.6 billion in 1993-94; it will grow to an impressive $7 billion in 1994-95. It is reinvesting more every year in mineral projects and, in particular, in the further value adding and processing of mineral products in Australia. For example, in Western Australia in the Pilbara region alone, some $4 billion is under consideration for value adding and processing investments. The most advanced of these is a $750 million investment by BHP in a hot briquette iron plant at Port Hedland. A final decision on this project is expected in the next two months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member asked what government policy was doing to encourage further investment. Obviously, through the COAG process, gas reform has led to significant changes in the way Australian mineral companies see their opportunities, in Western Australia in particular. The hot briquette plant for BHP that I mentioned would not have occurred unless the Western Australian government had embraced the reform process for the gas industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in this year's budget was some $200,000 for this year and next year for a project on the goldfields pipeline which will encourage investment in that area by looking at the infrastructure needed to bring together not only the governments of Western Australia and the Commonwealth but also companies like Western Mining which are looking at the opportunities that will come from the pipeline that will flow through to Kalgoorlie. Obviously, that is of great benefit to Australia. For example, if the hot briquette program were to go ahead, as I think it will, instead of exporting iron ore at $22 per tonne for iron ore finds, we would get $190 per tonne for iron ore briquettes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, this would have a very powerful impact on the current account. Once more, this industry is playing a vital role in Australia's future.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I informed members yesterday&mdash;and I know that there has been some concern because individual members have approached both me and the President about this&mdash;the Joint House Department suggested that the registered nurse grade 3 position currently held by a registered nurse grade 2 acting on higher duties be abolished. The registered nurse grade 2 would therefore revert to a substantive position, as is generally the case for any person who undertakes temporary higher duties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither the President nor I, as I indicated yesterday, have agreed to the proposed changes. However, advice given by the Department of Industrial Relations has indicated that, because of changed work duties, the registered nurse grade 3 position should be reset at grade 2. Following discussions today with our officials, the President and I agreed that the Joint House Department attempt to reopen discussions with the ANF and put to it proposals for resolving the situation. The ANF this morning, I think, imposed a picket at the nurses station.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussions with the ANF, the Joint House Department officers, firstly, reiterated that the level of services required by the parliament at the nurses centre was basic first aid service; secondly, advised that after consultation with the Department of Industrial Relations the department supported RN level 2 classification and did not support the level 3 classification; but, thirdly, made a without prejudice offer to establish a flat staffing structure across the board at level 2. The ANF has rejected the offer and advised that it will only stop its industrial action upon receiving a written letter signed by the Presiding Officers guaranteeing the level 2 and 3 structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present moment, the JHD is lodging notification of an industrial dispute with the IRC. I understand that that matter is being listed for hearing at 4.30 this afternoon. I will advise the chamber of further developments in due course. But I want to state unequivocally: not one person in that centre would lose their job over the proposals that were being considered but not adopted by either the President or me. We are looking at ways in which this matter can be corrected quickly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I want to speak on the same issue, because the acoustics of this place are terrible. Can I suggest to you that the function of the microphones is not in any way to regulate the voices of people in the place; it is rather to ensure that those who are in the chamber can hear what is going on. It is for you to determine who has the call; it is not for those in charge of the microphones. I would suggest it would be far more appropriate if at least your microphone and the two at the dispatch boxes on the front bench were on at all times. From this part of the House, more often than not we have no idea what is going on over there because we cannot hear it. I suggest that it would be appropriate therefore that, irrespective of who has the call, those three microphones be alive all the time. It might considerably help our understanding of what is going on in the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst there are obviously deep and very bitter divisions within the Labor Party over the government's weak response to the issue of French nuclear tests, there are not divisions in the Australian community about Labor's attitude. First, 95 per cent of Australians are opposed to the resumption of French nuclear testing but, secondly, the overwhelming majority of Australians believes that this government's response to the French has been weak, ineffectual and vacillating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you go around the Australian community, one of the things you find is that Australians are overwhelmingly ashamed of their government for not showing strength when strength of government really matters; that is, standing up for the national interest in international affairs. This government's response will go down in history as one of the truly weak actions in Australian foreign policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When, finally, last Friday the government decided that it would come up with a package of different measures, which were announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) after a cabinet meeting that we read all about in the weekend newspapers, all the government was basically doing was playing follow-the-leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members on our side will remember only too well that last week, as a result of a coalition initiative, the Prime Minister decided he would come into the House and move a motion condemning the French for resuming nuclear tests. Members on the other side may not remember that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) moved an amendment to that motion with four different proposals in it. Each of those proposals, interestingly enough, by Friday had been picked up by the government and the government was running around saying, `Look how strong we've been.' I notice the Prime Minister in his press release used the word `strong' a dozen or so times to try to make the point. You always have to be suspicious of people who do that. Bob Hawke when he was Prime Minister always used to say that he was honest. Why did he always feel it was necessary to tell people he was honest? Because he knew we did not assume he was. This Prime Minister goes on and on about how strong he is. `I am strong,' he says, `and here is my strong response,' which basically incorporated the four different proposals that the coalition put in its amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Labor Party had voted against those proposals. Never forget that, when the coalition said on Tuesday that Australia should suspend defence ties with France, you people over there voted against it. On Tuesday you were not in favour of suspending defence ties with France&mdash;but by Friday the heat of the kitchen made you change. That is playing follow-the-leader. That is not being strong; that is being weak and vacillating. For you to vote against a whole series of measures and then subsequently incorporate them is pathetic hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No wonder the public are ashamed of their government. What we found out today says a great deal about the Labor Party and the way it handled this issue. We know that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), Senator Ray and Senator Evans all wanted to make a weak response on this issue. They always had wanted to take a soft line. What we have discovered today is that one of the measures that the government suddenly decided to implement&mdash;that is, the return of the Australian ambassador in Paris for consultations&mdash;was already planned. We have discovered that the ambassador had already planned to return here on leave. The French government had already been told by the ambassador that he was coming back on leave. Senator Evans and the Prime Minister put out a press release saying that one of their tough measures against the French was that the ambassador was going to come back here on leave for consultations. The ambassador had planned about two months ago to speak to the Australian Business in Europe Forum this Thursday in Sydney. He was always coming back. How seriously can you take the latest bout of measures?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also discovered, since the government has said that there will be no defence procurement initiatives as far as the French are concerned, that the government had no intention of making a decision to buy French defence equipment over the next nine to 12 months&mdash;absolutely no intention at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking of divisions in the Labor Party, the government, let us face it, has rejected a large number of the proposals put forward by the Left. I dug out the press release that the Left put out the night Brian Howe said he was retiring as Deputy Prime Minister. There were 10 different demands by the Left. They are in the press release which described President Chirac as `a captive of the French military-industrial complex'&mdash;that old, charming language of the 1950s. When you go through the press release and look at the 10 proposals, what the government has agreed to is three of the 10 proposals. Three out of 10 is the score that the Left must give the government for its response on nuclear testing. Then we have the members sitting at the back, the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth).

Their view is a perfectly rational view, oddly enough, on this occasion. You are two people who said it was an absolute disgrace and that you totally disagreed with it. The Left of the Labor Party, of course, is a pitiful and weak creature. You got three out of 10 and ran around the press gallery and out into the community saying you are satisfied.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this basically does is underline the deep divisions, the deep splits, there are in the government on this important issue. What sort of message does that send to the French?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the real point here is: what is the source of all these divisions? As usual, the fount of all evil in this government is the Prime Minister himself. What Senator Evans has done&mdash;at least a source close to Senator Evans, such as his mouth&mdash;in this article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> is effectively say that the Prime Minister argued that Australia should take a soft and weak position.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After that cabinet meeting, the strident and strong things Senator Evans was proposing&mdash;his friend told this to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;were not implemented by the cabinet.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That letter is a weak letter. That letter concedes the point. That letter was basically a wink and a nudge to President Chirac saying that politically we will have to protest but deep down inside we do not care too much. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that we show people in the gallery and around Australia the record of the opposition on this matter. The last time the opposition was in government&mdash;back in the early 1980s&mdash;the minister for foreign affairs was then Minister Street. A question was asked of him by Mrs Darling, a Labor member. She asked the minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did his Department receive information confirming that a nuclear device was detonated at Muroroa Atoll on 9 December 1980. If so, did the Government lodge any protest with the French Ambassador; if not, why not?</PARA>
<PARA>The former minister for foreign affairs in the last Liberal government&mdash;he is now not even a member of parliament&mdash;Mr Street, answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I have reason to believe that France conducted further underground nuclear tests at Muroroa Atoll in the South Pacific in the period late November to early December.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Australia's opposition to France's continued nuclear testing in the South Pacific is well known. This has been frequently reiterated. It is not, however, the Government's practice to make approaches to the Governments concerned whenever a nuclear weapon state carries out an underground nuclear explosion. We make formal approaches to the country concerned when an atmospheric test has been conducted.</PARA>
<PARA>What the opposition was saying then was that it did not matter if the French did it under the ground, it was not going to make any sort of approach and it was not going to protest at all. This is the standard sort of approach the opposition has used for many years. It is only in the last couple of weeks that we have ever heard the opposition talk about nuclear testing. Why? Because it thinks there is a vote in it. That is what the opposition is all about. There is nothing else in the opposition's posturing day after day on this issue. It just thinks it can get votes. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in October 1985, I was a member of Labor Parliamentarians for a Nuclear Free Australia. Let me read to honourable members what the Labor Party was doing back then. The convenor of Labor Parliamentarians for a Nuclear Free Australia was the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who has just walked in. We were actually doing something. The first newsletter of the Labor Parliamentarians for a Nuclear Free Australia states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labour Parliamentarians for a Nuclear Free Australia is a group of Federal Labor MP's who have joined together because of their common concern about nuclear issues irrespective of any other difference which may exist between them.</PARA>
<PARA>What that means is that all the factions in the Labor Party joined together in this particular group to make certain that the nuclear issue came to the forefront. Let us now have a look at what the newsletter said about the leader of the Liberal Party at the time&mdash;the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The election of John Howard to the Liberal leadership highlights more than ever before the moral bankruptcy of the conservative parties on the important issues of nuclear disarmament. More than any other Liberal, John Howard has promoted Australia's involvement in Star Wars and the MX Missile testing programme.</PARA>
<PARA>I did not just print this newsletter yesterday, or last week, or last month, or last year. It was printed in October 1985. It was relevant then and it is relevant now.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COMPERE:  What do you think about French actions in our area of the world, particularly their nuclear policy which has led, in July, to some fairly violently covert actions in Auckland Harbour?</PARA>

<PARA>And their time has come. If we look at the other side of the House, there is one wet over there at the moment&mdash;I cannot put him down as a dry&mdash;but they certainly run. If we look at everyone on the frontbench of the opposition, we will see that they are all extreme right-wingers. They are like the Copelands and that sort of mob who have come in and taken over the Liberal Party. I am sorry to say that they are the people who are running the Liberal Party. The Crichton-Brownes and those sorts of people are running the Liberal Party today. There are a few operators, advisers and pollsters giving them advice at the moment saying to them, `Jump on any issue that looks as if you can get a few votes out of it. Don't say anything too much. Don't say anything about policies. Confuse and upset the general population, but don't give any policies out, and just jump on popular issues.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, if it was popular to chop your foot off, opposition members would all be doing it. They are the sorts of people who would do anything to get a vote. They are like Jeffrey Kennett in Victoria. Before he was elected he agreed with everything. There was nothing you could say that Jeffrey would not agree with. He said that he would do this and he would do that. He said that employers would all get special grants to take on unemployed workers, there would be no increases in taxes and that there would be no charges. He also said that he would be balancing the budget and that no-one would be sacked. But look what happened as soon as he got in there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mob opposite is trying to use that exact strategy before the next election, whenever that may be. As I said, opposition members will jump on any popular issue, so we should continually look at their record&mdash;what they have done and said in the past. That is how people can get an idea of what they are really about. Do not believe the rhetoric that is coming out of them now. The hypocrisy of what they are saying is amazing. In 1987 John Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say again, notwithstanding my wish to sound, as far as possible, a bipartisan note on matters affecting the relationship with New Zealand, that the Prime Minister again evinces a note of complacency about the atmosphere as it prevails in the South Pacific. It will be no secret or surprise to this Parliament for the Liberal and National parties to say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we share none of the enthusiasm for the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty to which Australia is an adherent. We do not share the rather misty-eyed view of the Government about the value of this Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA>Opposition members have shared none of that enthusiasm, and we can keep going through what John Howard has said to highlight that&mdash;we do not even have to look at what other opposition members have said. We have looked at some of the speeches of opposition members by feeding into our computer database `nuclear' and other words. For half the opposition names we put in, no items came up on the computer. We are doing a search to see how many times opposition members have actually mentioned the word `nuclear' over the past few years. I can assure honourable members that not many of them have even mentioned the word `nuclear' once. We move on to 8 December 1987 and once again a speech by Mr Howard. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has abandoned any pretence of regional responsibility through its passivity towards New Zealand's abrogation of its alliance responsibility, its irresponsible South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, its poor intelligence capacity and its misguided priorities. It has helped to create a serious vacuum in the region.</PARA>
<PARA>John Howard says this over and over again during his speeches. He condemned us for what we were doing then and he condemns us for standing up to the French now. He is now jumping on board this populist bandwagon because he thinks he can get a few votes out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At lunchtime today, the federal caucus of the Australian Labor Party presented to the nation a scroll with the signatures of 104 caucus members on it, including the signatures of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). The wording on that scroll will be read out later in this debate. We are certainly not a divided party on this side of the House; the division is on your side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scroll is similar to the one that was taken up 10 years ago by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The minister and I, with some others, went around and got Bob Hawke, who was the Prime Minister at the time, to sign a scroll. The minister then took it to the South Pacific Forum. Once again, we were protesting at that time about what the French were doing. Did we hear any protest from the other side? Not once. Opposition members thought that it was a waste of time, and that will be expanded on later. As I have said, they are all about jumping on an issue which they think will be able to get them some votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of us have been working long and hard for this and we are pleased with what is happening. We are pleased that a comprehensive test ban treaty will be signed&mdash;but whether it can be adhered to in the future is hard to know. No matter what happens, some of us will be working hard to make certain that at least this parliament does its utmost to ensure that it is adhered to. I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been working hard on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members are saying, `We know what is in the letter that the Prime Minister has sent to the French Prime Minister. We haven't seen it, but we know what's in it.' That is the sort of rhetoric that they will use during this debate. They will pursue innuendo and hypothetical ideas, all the time not knowing anything about what is in the letter. I do not know what is in it. It is a cabinet letter direct from our Prime Minister to Prime Minister Chirac, and I believe that those sorts of things should stay private and confidential. It would be interesting to see some of the correspondence between the then foreign minister, the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, and the various prime ministers of the day in the years leading up to 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Labor Party stands firmly behind its policy in its opposition to nuclear weapons.

They will continue to make certain that they do not believe in their hearts in what we are doing. They will make certain that they confuse the issue and they will try to jump on this popular bandwagon. They are certainly the Johnny-come-latelys in this particular effort. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this is all about is the government's failure to read the mood of the community and the government's internal divisions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week we had the Keating statement, which was pretty weak. The Prime Minister stood up and made a few recommendations, and the Leader of the Opposition proposed a few amendments. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that we join with New Zealand and suspend military cooperation with France except for surveillance, United Nations and humanitarian activities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the Prime Minister's statement of the 23rd. He stood up and said Australia's response to the French decision has been strong, unequivocal and concrete. This is the strong, unequivocal and concrete statement issued by your Prime Minister last Friday. He said that he is going to recall the ambassador from Paris. As we have already heard from my colleague the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), the ambassador was already coming home as of two months ago. The French must be trembling in their shoes! They knew that was happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said he will recall the senior ADF representative in Paris&mdash;again, already arranged. Then he talked about restricting access for ships and aircraft visits. This is really strong stuff. The Prime Minister said he will cancel a planned visit to Noumea by HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle</EMPHASIS> in September to participate in the New Caledonia VP celebrations. That is really going to make a heck of an impact on the French government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister talked about the cancellation of planed visits by two maritime surveillance vessels, Fremantle class patrol boats, later this year. This is all `hitting them with a feather duster' type stuff. The Prime Minister talked about maritime patrol aircraft visits to Noumea being cancelled and all of that sort of thing. Then look at the trading measures. He said that we will be suspending certain trading activities until France ceases nuclear testing. So it is okay because we will have a nice little holiday while the French are doing their testing but then we will switch these things back on again. This is really, I must say, marshmallow diplomacy. It is absolutely disgraceful. The gentlemen opposite have the gall and the hide of a rhinoceros when they stand up in this place, after having a week ago voted against the measures that we had, and try to make themselves out to be some sorts of heroes by coming up with the gimmick of holding up a chart in this place. </PARA>

In terms of the Australian response, one per cent thought it was too strong&mdash;probably the two sitting over there&mdash;but it was about right for 27 per cent and too weak for 61 per cent.

As my colleague the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) has indicated, all previous opposition speeches and comments on this matter have been ones based on opposition to the government taking a strong position on French nuclear testing. Quotes were given to us from when the Leader of the Opposition was last the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;back in 1986 and 1987&mdash;and when he outlined to the people of Australia that he believed the government was being anti-French and overreacting to nuclear tests in Mururoa and that there are bigger issues we should be worried about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that opposition members are the ones who are trying to catch up in the politics of this issue. The member for Dunkley and I have no problems with being involved in this issue. Ours is a consistent position and one that the federal parliamentary Labor Party has consistently taken for more than 30 years. We have consistently opposed nuclear testing, we have consistently opposed the development of nuclear weapons and the Hawke and Keating Labor governments have been the strongest advocates for a comprehensive test ban treaty and for getting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty confirmed with an indefinite extension. So we have the runs on the board. That is the problem that the opposition has in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members believe the people of Australia are fools and have short memories. That is the basis of their politics in this debate.

We wanted a nuclear-free future. But what did my Liberal and National opponents say and do then? They were not in the rallies. They opposed the rallies.

<PARA>In relation to these amendments, and for the record, I will briefly put a number of matters before the House. The government is moving amendment No. 1 because it does not support the coalition's proposal which would allow the tourism industry to claim free samples. The government is concerned that the cost of this coalition proposal would be between $5 million and $10 million per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also want to place on record that no industry sector is allowed to claim free samples given away in Australia, and to allow this amendment would be to give preferential treatment to the tourism industry over other industry sectors. The Australian Tourist Commission already funds these types of promotional visits which are, in any event, felt to be in the national tourism industry's interest. The government has some very serious concerns about the accountability of free samples for this industry sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government amendment No. 2 relates to the coalition's amendment which would allow the tourism industry access to joint venture facilities. The government opposes that amendment and is moving to withdraw the provision on the following grounds. The cost is estimated to be initially $2 million to $3 million which, on the scale of the Commonwealth's budget, may be relatively small but there is a very real concern that the cost may escalate quickly. Furthermore, large tourism operators currently excluded because of the $25 million export earnings upper limit would be able to gain access to the scheme through this facility. The scheme would also promote a number of developments which may not otherwise occur. Fundamentally, tourism operates through joint promotion anyway and the existing provisions of the act encourage this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be stressed that the aggregation of three or more tourism amenities would qualify the group for the 50 per cent grant rate, thereby providing a means of circumventing the application of the 25 per cent rate to single-service providers. Finally, because inbound tour operators operate largely on a joint basis with providers there is the potential, under the current rules, for them to receive multiple grants for joint ventures for different components of the same promotion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 3 relates to the insertion of new section 21A. It is in response to the Democrats' and coalition amendment to the Export Market Development Grant Amendment Bill in the Senate which provides for a 50 per cent grant to single-service tourism providers. The government is opposed to the initiative of the coalition and the Democrats in this matter and will move to reinstate the 25 per cent grant rate provided for in the bill as originally introduced in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of this amendment is estimated to be $5 million in 1995-96, $7.5 million in 1996-97, $9 million in 1997-98 and $9 million 1998-99. This places a very heavy onus on the coalition to justify these expenditure proposals. Very vociferous arguments are often put by the coalition in this regard. The government would say that they are often mindless arguments for cost cutting. This is an example of a significant increased cost. Again, the coalition says one thing and then says something very different in relation to the matter before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's approach to this matter is based on the findings of EMDG-ITES evaluation which included independent analysis by Price Waterhouse, Professor Ron Bewley, the head of the economics department of the University of New South Wales, and the Allen Consulting Group. The evaluation found that a portion of the tourism industry promotion did not create additional tourism and that it directed tourists who were already coming to Australia to particular facilities. This is the captive market consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evaluation also found that there was a very strong interrelationship between individual promotion and generic promotion. It is a matter of record that the government already provides significant support for generic promotion through the Australian Tourist Commission. Given these  considerations, the government considers that the 25 per cent rate gives fair and balanced access for the tourism industry. These matters have been the subject of very serious consideration within the government and they deserve the support of the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to support the amendments to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill agreed to by the Senate. The member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) will dwell more on a bipartisan report relevant to this subject. I will simply make four points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who has just spoken, that there are ways that the government can play an effective role in the worldwide promotion of the Australian inbound tourist industry. An incident which occurred in Berlin earlier this year still irks the tourist industry and annoys me no end. The Australian Tourist Commission mounted a major tourist promotion at the International Tourismus Borse in Berlin. That happened to be on at the time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was visiting Germany. It also happened that the Prime Minister arrived in Berlin around lunch time on the very critical and pivotal last fully operational day of the tourismus borse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was put to the Prime Minister that he might like to spend one hour at the International Tourismus Borse and in so doing give a real lift in terms of promotion&mdash;I will concede that much&mdash;to the Australian inbound tourist operators and the Australian Tourist Commission that had gone to great expense to be there. Instead the Prime Minister had to go straight to his hotel. He had nothing on for the rest of that afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister displayed a very cavalier attitude on that aspect of tourism. Another cavalier attitude of this government with regard to tourism and the export market development grants scheme is evident by the very words of the minister. He said that the government was seeking to knock out amendments which have quite properly been put in by the Senate and which are now part of the bill before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeking to give the tourism industry a fair go. We do not want the tourism industry to be subject to the 25c or 25 per cent rate; we want it to be subject to the standard rate that is applicable to other industries under the export market development grants scheme. We want that reflected in a sensible approach to the amendments that are before the chamber at this time. Single-service tourist providers are entitled to promote their products worldwide. I do not think the government would disagree with that. The opposition says that they are entitled to do that with the application of the standard rate of assistance under the EMDG scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is being responsible on its approach to the EMDG scheme and to the budget. The government has failed in this legislation to pick up on one of its own budget announcements&mdash;namely, to reduce the cap on EMDG grants from $250,000 to $200,000. You have to concede that that was in the budget that was brought down on 9 May. That should have been one of the government's amendments to this legislation, but we will have a separate amending bill to implement that if and when the House returns. It costs $1 million for every piece of amending legislation that goes through this parliament. It will cost $1 million to put through, in a separate compartment, an element of the budget which reduces the maximum allocation for the export market development grants scheme from $250,000 to $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the government a start on this matter and show it how responsible the opposition is on this issue. In anticipation of that legislation, I have already taken the matter to the shadow cabinet and a joint party meeting and we have decided that we will be supporting the government's proposal to reduce the maximum limit from $250,000 to $200,000. We will be supporting the government's saving on that aspect of the budget. We are being utterly responsible with the capping of the EMDG scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that it would have required a degree of flexibility and some drafting panache to bring forward that amendment at this time. I have a degree of respect for those sitting in the advisers' box at this time. I am sure that they would have been capable of bringing forward the right sort of amendment to save the House dealing with that aspect of the budget at a later time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I commend the wine industry for the role it plays in this area. Every bottle of Australian wine that is exported has the potential to promote Australia as a tourist destination when it is consumed in Europe, North America and elsewhere. You cannot compare the wine industry with the tobacco industry as some would do. I will not dwell on that point except to say that these amendments are the correct way forward. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite frankly, I am puzzled by the government's position on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill. It seems to me that the government has decided that the tourism industry and in particular small tourism operators are only half equal to the rest of Australian business. That is inequitable, unfair and discriminatory. It says that this government does not care about tourism. Those opposite talk a lot about how they care about tourism, but when it comes to the hard end of the equation, when it comes to putting a shovel into the ground, there is no action; there is no joy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is now going to take away the amendments which were quite properly put into this legislation by the opposition and other parties in the Senate. Back in 1993 this same government, through the then minister, asked the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology to investigate the tourism industry and the export market development grants scheme&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Rocher)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! The honourable member for La Trobe would have heard what I just had to say. I am looking through these amendments and I really find it difficult to understand how what he is now talking about has anything to do with the formulae and adjusted eligible expenditure. I think you had better get to the amendments very quickly or resume your seat. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OT4">Mr CHARLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. That was what I was referring to, in that the amendments that we are debating here today were proposed by the industry, science and technology committee in June 1993 in a report tabled in this House entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Undersold overseas? Tourism and the export market development grant scheme</EMPHASIS>. The report referred precisely to two of the major amendments that we are debating here today. The committee recommended to the minister, firstly, that single-service tourism operators be treated the same as every other applicant under the export market development grants scheme and, secondly, that consortia of tourism operators and joint ventures of tourism operators be treated in precisely the same manner as every other consortia or grouping of operators in any other industry&mdash;whether it be the manufacturing industry, parts of the service industry, the education industry or whatever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue before the parliament this afternoon is the fact that the government is rejecting portions of the bill before this House which have quite properly been put into the bill by the Senate. They were put into the bill on the advice of a bipartisan committee in 1993 ahead of the August 1993 budget so that the minister could put it in the budget at that time. The minister failed to do so. It is of great relevance that, in the two years since that report came down, the government and the minister have failed to come into this House and advise of the government's reaction to that report. It is an absolute denial of the way this place should operate. It is a basic democratic principle that, when a minister asks for a report from a standing committee of this House, he should give a response to the recommendations of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the minister at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), has said in speaking to these amendments is that the government in essence rejects that report which it asked for. The minister knows that over half of the committee was made up of members of the government. In fact, the chair of that committee at the time is now the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Bevis). He sat at the table last night when this bill was debated in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Single-service tourism operators are faced with a very high cost in order to enter new markets, particularly overseas markets. They have every right to be treated equally and to get the full EMDG rebate that other industries expect to receive when they enter new markets overseas. We have been told in this place that tourists come to Australia not because of a hotel or an attraction but because they want to come to Australia. The point is that, if they do not have in front of them at the time they are making a decision information about where they might go, where they might stay or what they might see, they will decide to go somewhere else. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An agenda for families</EMPHASIS> the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) noted that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . families are the basic building blocks of our national life. They provide care like no government or any other agency ever can. They are the most important providers of education, health, welfare and personal development. Families nourish our potential, and nurture our individual and collective aspirations. They shape our character and pass on our values. They create a sense of belonging and continuity . . . Because the welfare of our people and the strength of our communities and our nation depend on families, governments have a duty to support them.</PARA>
<PARA>The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill, with which we are dealing now, makes it clear that the government is continuing to meet that duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government already provides substantial direct assistance to families with children, particularly low income families. In 1995-96 the government expects to spend over $12 billion in payments and subsidies to families. Nearly half of this comprises family payments to help families with the costs of raising children. The bill implements a number of initiatives announced in the 1995 budget that respond not only to the particular needs that families have at certain times but also to the need of families to deal with a simpler and more consistent system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A maternity allowance will be introduced from 1 February 1996. The allowance, equal to six times the maximum weekly rate of parenting allowance&mdash;that is, $816 at current rates&mdash;will be paid for each child born on or after 1 February 1996. It will be paid irrespective of whether the mother is in or outside the paid work force prior to the child's birth. The maternity allowance recognises that the majority of women in the work force are not entitled to paid maternity leave and, at the same time, recognises the extra financial burden placed on all families following the birth of a child. It represents a further significant enhancement of the social wage by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maternity allowance will also be paid for new-born adopted children, stillborn children and for children who die soon after birth. All families who meet the family payment residency and income and assets tests will qualify for maternity allowance. It is estimated that maternity allowance will be paid for some 223,000 children each year&mdash;that is, about 85 per cent of children born each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A single family payment will replace the existing basic family payment and additional family payment from 1 January 1996. This change recognises the fact that the different rate structures for basic family payment and additional family payment make it difficult for families to work out their entitlements. A further change will mean that family payment will be payable to whichever member of a couple is the primary carer of a family's child or children. This change will remove the existing gender bias. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Family payment will have three rates, depending only on the age of the child. The maximum fortnightly rates, to be indexed on 1 January 1996, are $88.90 for a child under 13; $115.80 for a child aged 13 to 15; and $55.70 for a student child aged 16 to 18. The minimum fortnightly rate, which will be indexed on 1 January each year, will be $21.70 for each child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large family supplement will be paid to families with four or more children at a fortnightly rate of $7.20 for the fourth and each subsequent child. Under the family payment income test, every dollar of income over the free area will reduce entitlement by 50c per year. Families whose income would reduce their payment below the minimum will still be paid the minimum rate, provided their income is below the income ceiling. This ceiling, to be indexed annually, is equivalent to the current basic family income test limit of $61,020 plus $3,051 for the second and each subsequent child. The minimum rate may also be paid under other special circumstances, such as hardship and temporary absence from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Family payment will continue to be subject to an assets test. Families with assets between $376,750 and $559,250&mdash;these amounts will be indexed annually&mdash;will be limited to the minimum rate. Families with assets over this limit may qualify for family payment under special provisions. A maintenance income test will also apply to family payment but will not reduce the rate to below the minimum rate of family payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income and assets free areas for family payment and Austudy will be aligned at 1 January 1996 and indexed according to changes in the CPI in January each year. Student dependency limits will be set at the Austudy 18-year-old `away from home' rate and measured over a financial year&mdash;and, for social security purposes, the age of dependency of students will be aligned to the Austudy age of 22 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, some families have expressed great concern that they have not been able to have their family payment reassessed when they have a change in family circumstances because their incomes have fallen by less than 25 per cent. The bill addresses this problem by making family payment more responsive to the needs of families facing a drop in income. From 1 January 1996 any family who has a fall in their income will be able to apply to have their family payment based on an estimate of their income in the current financial year, rather than the previous financial year, regardless of the size of the reduction in income. This will mean that families will be able to receive additional benefits at the time they need them most. They will not have to wait until the next annual assessment to have their family payment increased. This improvement to the responsiveness of the system will benefit over 62,000 families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the previous rules, families who needed to advise the Department of Social Security of a change in circumstances and whose incomes increased by less than 25 per cent were not obliged to have their family payments reviewed and were allowed to keep the extra payments for the rest of the year as windfall gains. Under the new rules to be implemented from 1 January 1996, families who have a notifiable change in circumstances and whose incomes increase will have their family payment reassessed if their estimated income is 10 per cent higher than their base tax year income and 10 per cent above their income free limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families will be able to amend their income estimates whenever and as often as they choose and will be allowed a 10 per cent margin for error on family payment income estimates. Only families whose actual income is at least 110 per cent of their estimated income will incur an overpayment. This will avoid the need to raise and recover smaller family payment overpayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister further noted in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An agenda for families</EMPHASIS>, `families change in character and shape with the changing times, but their essential roles remain the same. Good policy is both responsive to change and consistent with the unchanging roles and needs of families.' That is the guiding philosophy of the government's agenda for families, for the measures included in this bill and for a number of other measures relating to families that will be included in social security bills to be introduced later this year. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some things in the second reading speech on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill with which I can agree. The comments at the introduction of the speech quoting the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in relation to his document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An agenda for families</EMPHASIS> has some very useful guiding principles. They are also alluded to at the end of the speech, where reference is made to the fact that `families change in character and shape with the changing times, but their essential roles remain the same. Good policy is both responsive to change and consistent with the unchanging roles and needs of families'. With that I also agree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will not be opposing the measures that are before us. Given the modesty of the matters that have been addressed in this Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill, I am surprised the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) did not blush with embarrassment at having to read such a poor and lamentable speech into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill introduces essentially four measures: the much heralded maternity allowance, about which I will have some comments to make; the amalgamation of the basic and family payment, about which I will have some comments to make; the amendment to ensure that payment is paid to a primary carer of a child whether the carer is the mother or father, an eminently sensible but, as I say, modest reform; and the amendments to align the indexation method and asset levels of family payment and Austudy to which we will not demur but which has clearly winners and losers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the financial impact of each of the matters that have been addressed, other than the maternity allowance, you will find that in the main they are of very modest proportions and some of them, while they are held out to be beneficial to families, are adverse to some. If you exclude the maternity allowance, the bill produces savings to the government; it does not produce new benefits to families. In particular, when you get to the increased responsiveness of the family payment income test, a large number of families lose benefits by the alignment of the adjustments that are made&mdash;previously by average weekly earnings and now by the consumer price index. If you bring them into alignment, those who have received adjustments under average weekly earnings and now come to get them under the CPI will receive less in the nature of support than they received previously. I would have thought that somebody who was introducing benefits of that sort, characterising them in glowing terms, as I said, would have been significantly embarrassed about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maternity allowance is the most expensive item in the financial impact statement. It will cost $78 million in the first year, and $184 million in the second and third years. Even that is a breach of good faith with the Australian public. The maternity allowance was heralded as part of the Accord Mark VII. The Accord stated that the government would consider the introduction of a maternity allowance in accordance with the International Labour Organisation convention. The Prime Minister thought so much of it that he followed it up with a statement supporting this approach in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As became clear, particularly as the budget approached, the government was not going to be able to honour that undertaking and it scuttled off to the ACTU to strike a new deal in relation to the allowance in exchange for an increase in the wage safety net. It was part of the deal in relation to wages and salary increases. People were given less in the way of a salary and wage increase under the Accord. As a result of that, they were promised that there would be this maternity allowance in a budget that would follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Prime Minister was again toying with the emotions of families by promising them a payment and then changing the eligibility criteria. It ought to be understood that the maternity allowance as originally proposed, if it was to be implemented in accordance with the ILO convention, would have been for a period of 12 weeks, not the six-week period that is involved. It was clear that the government promised that it would be within the spirit of the ILO convention 103 entitled `Maternity Protection'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, if one looks at the last three OECD nations to introduce a maternity allowance, Australia is amongst that number. Mr Keating said that he intended to introduce a system that came up to the level of the ILO convention. He said in 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has in place a social security system which can equal anything in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that in introducing half a maternity allowance it is certainly not up to the Prime Minister's expectation of being equal to anything else in the world. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to the issue of the amalgamation of the basic and the additional family payment. Over a period of time a number of welfare organisations have, quite properly, made out the case&mdash;supported, I might say, enthusiastically by the opposition&mdash;that our family payments system generally is in need of reform. We have a host of different support regimes in place: the child-care cash rebate, the home child-care allowance that has now been subsumed into the parenting allowance, the family payments system or, if you go outside into other areas, the child support arrangements&mdash;each of them operating in many cases within different departments, each of them having different rules for eligibility and each of them providing an ad hoc arrangement for payment of family support. The system cannot continue reasonably in that way, and I think the government accepts that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government recognises that it needs to be prepared to make changes, but it finds the process of embarking upon such fundamental reform too difficult. I think that is the reality. So we have a situation in which the government has now merged the basic family payment and the additional family payment into one payment, still with the same qualification rules but with different rate structures and different income and assets tests. About the only things that have been got rid of as a result of this change are a title and a form. Contrary to any expectation, the change is next to negligible in terms of any fundamental reform of the system. It ought to be understood that this is another failure of the government to address the hard issues. It has not been prepared to deal with this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to go through the other matters because, as I said, they are not matters about which the opposition would want to demur, particularly in relation to the responsiveness of the family payment income test, and the family payment being paid to the primary care giver. But I do observe, as I did before, that the alignment of the income and assets levels in indexation arrangements for family payment and Austudy does have an adverse effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to measure the government's overall performance against its own agenda for families and against what it claims it ought to be doing in terms of offering, in the most positive way, support to families because it believes that the welfare of our people and the support of our communities in our nation depend upon families and that government has a duty to support them. I want to do so in the context of a wider range of issues. I foreshadow that I shall move an amendment to the second reading of this bill in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)its neglect of the welfare of families and its inability to deal with the increasing inequality between rich and poor;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)its failure to meet as promised a Maternity Allowance as outlined in Accord Mark VII and the postponement of any future effort to do so until 1999 in Accord Mark VIII;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)its misleading of the Australian public through the introduction of a number of measures affecting families which had not been announced and had not been policy prior or during the 1993 election but were introduced after the election; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)the failure of its Budget measures to immediately assist families by deferring the implementation until 1996 of modest measures in the rent assistance and the guardian allowance".</PARA>
<PARA>In support of the amendment I offer the following observations. It is important that this parliament note once more the considerable wealth of evidence in support of the argument that the government has neglected the welfare of families and been unable to deal with the increasing inequity and inequality between rich and poor in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent report, as I mentioned in the House the other day, was the report into poverty that was commissioned by the Queensland Social Services Committee. There were a number of poignant findings in that report that I think all government members need to note and have indelibly etched in their minds. In particular, the report showed that Queensland has the lowest average weekly disposable income at $555 a week; that sole parent families, couples with three or more children and young single people have the greatest chance of being in poverty; that one-fifth of the Queensland population lives in poverty; that 18 per cent or 350,000 Queenslanders live below the poverty line; that 26 per cent of those in poverty&mdash;that is, 136,000&mdash;are children; that 27.2 per cent of elderly people live in poverty; and that two in every three sole parents exist below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think they are damning statistics. They were confirmed by the Queensland agencies that were involved in this work, particularly in relation to the disbursement of emergency funds. I think that the disbursement figures, which I read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on a previous occasion and which are quite up to date, demonstrate in the starkest terms the groups of people, particularly in Queensland&mdash;but it can be amply demonstrated Australia-wide&mdash;that are not being supported or assisted by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply note on that point that it became clear this week when reading the fine print of the budget papers that the government is also withdrawing support from those organisations that offer emergency funding to assist the most vulnerable in our community. There is a reduction from some $17 million that was allocated last year to $14 million that has been allocated this year. So there are any number of issues which ought to prompt any parliamentary secretary, after reading the Prime Minister's statements about the needs of families, to be embarrassed about the government's performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to deal with several other matters of the government's performance. I have already covered the issue of the maternity allowance. The third paragraph of my proposed amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">its misleading of the Australian public through the introduction of a number of measures affecting families which had not been announced and had not been policy prior or during the 1993 election but were introduced after the election . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is timely to go back over the government's record on this issue. During the 1993 election we saw a number of measures that had immediate impact upon families in particular. These measures included reducing the income ceiling and assets value for the basic family payment, resulting in an estimated 118,000 families being excluded from the basic family payment; the inclusion for the first time of foreign payments in the income test for families; the application of the income and assets test to student parents; and a change in the rules relating to payment of overseas pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these measures were quite cynically taken up by the government after the election. None of them were foreshadowed in the quite voluminous policy documents purported to be the government's mandate for the election in 1993. None of them were outlined in there; yet they were clearly matters about which the government had had advice and for which it had been preparing the scene well in advance of the 1993 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do I remind people of the government's record in these matters at this time? I do so because of the cynical timing of the implementation of a number of the budget measures which are likely to affect families directly. In the cases I am going to mention the government has not included legislative amendments to give effect to them at this time. Why is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of them relates to an increase in rent assistance to families and the second relates to the increase in the guardian allowance of $2 a week, which is to be an additional benefit to assist the most vulnerable people; that is, those who are on sole parent pensions and who have been identified in every study as those in need of emergency support, and in particular by organisations like ACOSS as those whose income levels need to be thoroughly addressed through any study of benchmarking in relation to adequacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we see in relation to the guardian allowance? We see that the government proposes a $2 a week increase to sole parents, but that it has no intention of implementing it until 1996. Let me just say that again: the government proposes to increase the guardian allowance, which is for the most vulnerable, the people identified by ACOSS as being the people who are most urgently in need of support, by $2 a week in September 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the promised increase in rent assistance to assist families will not take place until March 1996. At the same time as the government intends to increase the rent assistance to people with children, it also intends to increase the threshold test for eligibility, so other families will miss out. Is it not remarkable that the cost of implementing the rent assistance increase is less than the amount of savings to be achieved through the adjustment to the threshold, which will require other families to forgo their rent assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it not interesting that, in the budget that has just been introduced, the significant measures that will bite into the future are postponed until after an election? I ask Labor members&mdash;and they might like to put this at a caucus meeting: what changes to our social security system are you now planning that are of the same ilk as those that were addressed on the last occasion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not like to dredge out some of the documentation that the public servants in the social security area advanced when they were asked to look at expenditure cuts that might be advanced in a budget situation, but I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security whether each of those&mdash;and I think the documents were fairly widely publicised at the time&mdash;particularly the lowering of the income test for family payments and the changing of the income test for the home child-care allowance, is part and parcel of the government's secret agenda it is saving up to deal with after the next election. I would like to hear from the government whether it is prepared to do what Neal Blewett did before the last election. </PARA>

There is only one person in this chamber who should be blushing with embarrassment and that is the representative of the emperor with no clothes, because he has absolutely no policies with which he can clothe himself in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has the gall to come in here and criticise the achievements of the Keating Labor government and all of the policies we have implemented and introduced over the last three years. He claimed that this legislation, which implements another package of those commitments and those policies, is somehow something that we should be embarrassed about. I can assure him that no-one on this side of the chamber is embarrassed at all. We are proud of our record of achievement for families, and we have every reason to be proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Berowra is the only person in this chamber who should blush with embarrassment, because he stood up here and could not give one word of advice to the people of Australia about what he would do if he were the minister for social security. It is about six to nine months before the next federal election and at this time the people of Australia expect to know what the opposition stands for. One would expect, with only a few months to go to the next federal election&mdash;some time within the next nine months&mdash;there would be some policy positions outlined, some detail, so that the people of Australia know what the opposition stands for. But the fact is that the opposition has no alternative policies to put up and, therefore, it has absolutely no credibility to come into this chamber and criticise a massive record of achievement for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would love to know which school the member for Berowra went to, because he obviously failed in maths.

There is also the amalgamation of the basic family payment and the additional family payment which will result in an increase for families of $3.39 million in 1995-96. To me, that adds up to over $80 million extra next financial year going to families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the two amendments to other issues, to align the income and asset test levels and indexation arrangements of family payments and Austudy, there will be a saving of $2.2 million next financial year. The other measure where there is a change is in the increased responsiveness to the family payment income test. That is a saving of $1.1 million. We have over $80 million extra being given to families in this legislation and savings of $3.3 million in some minor adjustments. If that is not a major contribution going to families in this next financial year, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I question seriously the education that the member for Berowra has received, because he obviously cannot add up. Again, the member for Berowra is clinging to the life raft of the QCOSS report. He claims that this shows how dreadful the Labor government has been in its achievement for families. I am sorry, but I am going to have to tell him that his life raft is full of holes, as that report is full of holes. It is founded on some very outdated information, as the member for Berowra well knows. There are very serious questions, as the honourable member also knows, about the credibility of the Henderson poverty line. His government, when the Liberals and Nationals were last in power, was hoist on the petard of the Henderson poverty line. Those opposite had a very sorry record indeed. We may talk a little more about that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To get back to the purposes of the legislation we are debating here, we are proud to be here today putting forward in this House legislation to introduce the maternity allowance. This legislation honours the government's commitment made in Accord Mark VII to give consideration to introducing a maternity allowance paid through the social security system in the spirit of ILO convention 103. It will result in an additional payment of $816 per family for children born after 1 February 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is expected that that will be paid to an estimated 223,000 children in a full year, which is about 85 per cent of all children that will be born in a year. Eighty-five per cent of families in Australia will receive this additional payment. It is equal to six weeks of full parenting allowance and, as the parliamentary secretary stated in the second reading speech, although it is $816 now, it will be a larger amount than that by the time it is introduced, because the parenting allowance will go up in September through indexation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us contrast that achievement with what the opposition did when it was last in power. This is why the member for Berowra can again blush with embarrassment. When his party was last in power it abolished the maternity allowance. It was a miserable amount of money, sure&mdash;it was only about $30&mdash;but those opposite did not even do what we did when we came into power, and that was to increase and index these payments. The honourable member's leader, who was Treasurer at the time, abolished the maternity allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has absolutely no legs to stand on in its criticism of the government in this matter. We are putting in place a fair, reasonable and good maternity allowance payment. We would like it to be more, and we have announced through Accord Mark VIII that it will be reviewed and probably increased over time. But at least we have put in place a fair and reasonable payment. We did not abolish any payments to families. What we have done is introduce lots of new payments for families, and this maternity allowance is one significant one that we have put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is going to be very significant to a lot of families because fewer than 20 per cent of women at the moment have access to any paid maternity leave. When they leave the work force to have a child, it creates a significant gap in their income. This payment, although it is not going to substitute completely for the working income they may have received, will substantially assist those families to cope with the additional costs they are going to face through the birth of a child. This is something that government members are very proud of, and we are very pleased to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other measures which have been outlined in the legislation. The amalgamation of the basic family payment and additional family payment, which will simplify existing entitlements to families, is an important measure and, as I indicated, in 1995-96, will result in an increased payment to families of $3.39 million. Another measure is the alignment of the income and asset test levels and indexation arrangements for family payment and Austudy. That is a sensible reform. It brings into being a simplification of the arrangements so that everybody understands that the same income and asset test levels apply in both situations. It is a minor saving, but it makes it a simplified system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are making a policy reform in the payment of family payment to the primary carer. The government has introduced this amendment to ensure that, from 1 January 1996, the family payment will be payable to whichever member of a couple is the primary carer of a child rather than stipulating that the mother is the only person to receive the payment. That reflects the fact that there are a number of Australian families where the father of the children or child is the primary carer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation builds upon our significant achievements and puts in place another important family payment for Australian families. It also builds upon the achievements that this government has brought about through its social security system. Labor has established one of the most sophisticated and flexible social security safety nets in the developed world. Since 1983 there has been a real increase in the basic pension rate of 12 per cent&mdash;a real increase over and above inflation of 12 per cent&mdash;and real increases in payments for children in the social security system of between 75 and 140 per cent. That was before we introduced this maternity allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rent assistance has been extended to the unemployed and low income working families, with real increases in payments of between 80 and 140 per cent after inflation. That is a significant achievement as well. Even with the ever rising Henderson poverty line since 1983, the income of single pensioners renting privately has increased from six per cent to 13 per cent above the poverty line. The income of a sole parent with two children and renting privately has increased from nine per cent below the poverty line when we came into power in 1983 to two per cent above the Henderson poverty line now. The income of an unemployed couple with one child and renting privately has increased from 11 per cent below the poverty line in 1983 when we came to power to one per cent above the Henderson poverty line now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Berowra, in a previous speech made in this House, criticised the government on its social wage achievements. Today, in his amendment to the second reading motion, he claims that we are deceiving or misleading the Australian public in the way in which we have introduced measures affecting families. He tries to discount the real achievement the social wage represents for all Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Berowra's leader has claimed that the social wage has done nothing to halt the slide for Australian families. It is obvious that the Liberal and National parties are desperately trying to ignore the social wage or to denigrate the achievements that have been made through the social wage. They realise that the government has an outstanding record in that area. Some of those things need to be put on record because they very much go to the heart of what we are about here. They emphasise the fact that the maternity allowance in this legislation builds upon this record of achievement and in fact gives the lie to the claims included in the amendment of the member for Berowra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around 80 per cent of Australian children now complete secondary school as opposed to 32 per cent in 1983. Expenditure on education is part of the achievement of the social wage. There has been almost a doubling in the number of Australians who proceed to higher education. There were 340,000 in 1983 and almost 600,000 in 1995. The number of government funded child-care places has risen from 46,000 in 1983 to 263,000. That is an outstanding achievement. This increase in child-care places has been brought about through an increase in child-care expenditure from around $50 million per annum in 1983 to nearly $900 million in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, one of the most important achievements of the social wage has been in the health system. When Labor came to power in 1983, more than two million Australians had no cover and no protection for their basic health needs. Yet now all of them are covered by the universal Medicare system, which is the best and fairest health insurance system in the world, the envy of the rest of the world. Whether we are talking about family payments and support for low income families, our achievements in education, our achievements in health expenditure or our achievements in child care, the fact that this government has delivered its commitment to Australian families is emphasised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1995 budget delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Willis), we have outlined a continuing agenda for families which will build upon the achievements we have made over the last 12 years. These achievements are things we are rightly proud of and they contrast markedly with the situation we have opposite where the coalition has no policies at all&mdash;nothing to offer to the Australian people except platitudes and criticisms. That is all the opposition can stand up and give in this House. It has no policies that can show what it would do for Australian families. That is something it should be condemned for. As I said, the coalition is only a few months away from facing an election, yet it is going, with no policies, to seek the support of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition thinks it can con its way through the next election. The Australian people are a very bright people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We keep being criticised for going back to the days when John Howard was Treasurer. The opposition hates us doing that.

We have the record of the last Liberal-National government. We need to look at that because it gives a very clear sign of what the coalition would do if it regained power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why we keep contrasting. It is not that we just want to show off how good we have been compared with the coalition; it is to send a very clear signal that, should we ever have the unfortunate situation of the coalition being back on the treasury bench of this country, history would repeat itself. We would have a situation where social wage expenditure&mdash;expenditure on health, education, housing and family support payments&mdash;would be slashed by 17 or 20 per cent. That is the record of the now Leader of the Opposition, from when his party was last in government. He slashed expenditure on social wage items by 17 per cent over a period of five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the Labor government done in the 12 years it has been in office? We have increased expenditure on those social wage items by 78 per cent in real terms. We have massively increased the expenditure on those items that directly benefit all Australian families: health, housing, education, family support and income support payments for low income families. That is why we constantly contrast the two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia need to know what they would be facing should we ever be in the unfortunate situation of the coalition being on the treasury bench and being the government of this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to support this legislation today. The maternity allowance is another major achievement of this government. It is something the opposition was never able to do. The last time the coalition was in power it abolished its miserable $30 maternity allowance. We have now introduced a maternity allowance which will result in a payment of at least $816 for 85 per cent of Australian families. It is something this parliament should be supporting unanimously and it is something the Australian people will recognise as a substantial contrast between the Labor government and its record of achievement for families and the hype, hyperbole and hypocrisy of the opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill to bring to the attention of the House, contrary to the speech of the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), the total disregard for Australian families this Labor government continues with in its sad journey of tired government. This legislation, which will not be opposed by the coalition, requires the amendment which the shadow minister, the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), moved previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I respond to a couple of points the member for Moreton raised because I found what he was saying a bit enlightening. He was saying that the government is so good, that the social wage is so great and that everything is so good and fantastic out in the electorate right now. Why then are the people of Cowan right now totally frustrated with the government and its lack of attention to the real issues of the community? What is the government doing about community safety? Nothing. What is the government doing about economic debt? Nothing. What is the government doing about the real issues of the community? The fact is that it is not doing anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Moreton referred to the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and quoted some of his comments made 10, 15 or 20 years ago. He was saying that we should look at these. He was saying that we should go back to those old times to look at what people said in parliament 10, 15 or 20 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the enlightenment of the member for Moreton, I say that things have changed. For instance, if we went back to 1969 when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made his maiden speech, we would see that he said it was a damned shame women were leaving the kitchens and how terrible that was. Surely the Prime Minister does not hold those views now. I am sure things have changed, he has changed and that our attitudes to those sorts of things have changed. The member for Moreton should understand that things have changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Moreton said that the Australian people will not be conned at the next election; they will not be fooled. That is quite right; they will not be. They were fooled at the last election by accepting and by being conned by some of the things the Labor Party had said in its election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also said that numbers in tertiary eduction have doubled and there are a whole lot of people staying at university. That is true: there are more people at university now than there ever were before. But, contrary to that, there are fewer new entrants to university than before. How can there possibly be more people at university but fewer people entering university? Students are not going on to work because there is no work around and they are, therefore, staying on at university to improve their skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also said that the Labor Party has a proud record on child care. He does not realise that the legislation that went through yesterday reduces the hours for supported child care. He does not realise that the home child-care allowance paid through the social security system discriminates directly against those who receive the child-care cash rebate, paid through the health system. He does not understand the discrimination families suffer when they choose to stay at home to look after their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also mentioned the universal health system, which he said was the best and fairest system and the system Australians want. The coalition agrees with that. We are not going to touch the health system at all. But I must also say to the honourable member for Moreton that in my electorate there is a young child with an ear infection who needs grommets. Under this universal health system, he has to wait eight months to get grommets in his ear. His parents could pay $500-plus in the form of an up-front payment to relieve the pain of a two-year-old boy by getting in straight away. How can this be the best and fairest system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also mentioned the budget&mdash;and I will be talking about the budget a bit later on and its effect on families. We can link many things to the Labor Party. There are a whole lot of machinations within the Labor Party&mdash;those from the labour movement, of which the ACTU is a part; those from the Labor Left, who appear to be the honourable ones of the Labor Party&mdash;if you disagree with what they say, you at least know that what they say they believe to be truthful and that they stand by their word&mdash;those from the Labor Right, mostly from New South Wales, who, as Senator Richardson once said, would do anything to stay in power; and those from the community groups Labor set up to dominate the debate on many issues. If a majority step out and say something on a particular issue, they are vilified quite readily by this group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From all those machinations and diverse groups&mdash;a coalition of all these diverse groups&mdash;there are many things that can be linked to the Labor Party. Let us go back to Senator Richardson's statement `Whatever it takes'. Over the years, the Labor Party has done whatever it takes to stay in power. It has done a lot of things. It has thrown money at certain issues. It will do and say anything to stay in power. Labor's 1993 policy document for older Australians stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's commitment to removing old age pensioners from the tax-free system by 1995 will benefit pensioners paid at the part rate as well as providing some assistance to retirees with incomes beyond the pension cut-out point.</PARA>
<PARA>This promise was not delivered. So the older people within our community, the older parts of our family, were ignored and the promise broken. On 19 February 1993 in his Investing in the Nation speech at the National Press Club, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . let me tell you something that I thought you might have known . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is the sort of autocratic arrogant style of the Prime Minister. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . they've been legislated. They are not a promise, they are law&mdash;L-A-W&mdash;law.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that he was talking about the tax cuts. In the 1993 election campaign, the Prime Minister said that the company tax rate would be reduced to 33c in the dollar. We realise that in this budget that has increased to 36c in the dollar. The Labor Party's health policy document for the 1993 federal election said that a federal Labor government would implement a Commonwealth dental health program to improve access to emergency and basic dental care for low income earners at a cost of $278 million in its first four years and $100 million in a full year. Yet another promise broken. On 24 February in a policy launch speech the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will open up Medicare to the private hospital system so that it can purchase an estimated 10,000 private hospital beds per year for people on waiting lists.</PARA>
<PARA>This promise has not been delivered. In fact, it has been broken and the hospital queues have lengthened. The Minister for Human Services and Health, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), promised that there would be no increase in the Medicare levy. Yet it is increasing on Saturday. It will go up to 1.5 per cent. So there are a number of promises that the Labor Party has made to stay in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many things that can be linked to the Labor Party. For instance, yesterday the Prime Minister said that the Labor Party was the natural party of the working class. I did not realise there was a class war going on in Australia, but he linked the ALP with the battler, the working class&mdash;that the ALP is the only party to represent the working class. What an outrageous thing to say. How can anyone suggest that the ALP is looking after the battlers when its social record is so poor? There is a lot of inaction on many social issues. There is plenty of rhetoric and plenty of money being supplied but no measurable improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most graphic example of this is the Aboriginal people, the indigenous people of Australia. For so long we have had the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), Minister Lawrence and the Prime Minister saying that they are going to do this and that&mdash;really paternalistic&mdash;but nothing has changed measurably. There are daily newspaper reports saying how bad the situation might be. This is a perfect example of the Labor Party throwing money at a problem without taking the responsibility for improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of the ALP government being out of touch is the recent report on the poor in Queensland&mdash;the ones the Prime Minister purports to represent. The report was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drawing the line</EMPHASIS> and was developed by some reputable workers in social services in Queensland. The report was about Queensland and the many social problems that state has under state and federal Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report looked at all of the arguments and definitions of poverty and looked at the disadvantaged. It also looked at how many people are disadvantaged, who is disadvantaged, the geographical factors affecting poverty and the material circumstances of those who are disadvantaged&mdash;that is, what it is like to live on a low income in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report contains many poignant facts and statistics. I want to let the statistics speak for themselves. They show that sole parent families, those that both the state government in Queensland and the federal government are looking after, couples with three or more children and young single people have the greatest chance of being in poverty. About one-fifth of the Queensland population live in poverty, and Queensland's poverty rate is two per cent greater than the national average; 18 per cent&mdash;that is, 350,000 people&mdash;live below the poverty line; 26 per cent, 136,000, of those who live in poverty in the state of Queensland are children; 27.2 per cent of elderly people live in poverty; and two in every three sole parents exist below the poverty line. Those are the statistics. That is the record of Queensland today and the problems faced by Queenslanders under Labor governments, both state and federally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can link many things to the Labor government. We can link the failed industrial relations legislation. We can link the failed child-care policy which, as I said before, discriminates against families and provides little choice. I will give you an example by way of an article that was written by Diana Dickie, who lives in Newman in north-west Queensland. She said she had four children and there was not enough money to run the family. In her article, she asked what options were available. She said she was under a lot of stress and a lot of pressure&mdash;so much so that she was advised to go to hospital for a couple of weeks to have a rest and to recover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her article, she said that, if she and her husband were to separate, they would get priority child care at a subsidised rate. She would get a pension&mdash;a payment for being at home and caring for their child, although there is still no recognition of that. They could get Austudy. They would be eligible for DEET schemes and all the associated support networks. They would be eligible for home help and some other forms of respite care. Financial assistance would also become available to them. They could even get onto state housing in Western Australia. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What do you get for staying together? My husband and I never stopped loving each other. We knew we had to make changes. I returned to the paid work force and we employed a nanny who came the days we were both working. Things did not improve. There was still the housework to do. We decided on a full-time, live in nanny and housekeeper. She cost $50 a week more than I was earning and I lost my family payment. If it had made things any easier for us, it would have been worth it, but it didn't.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say a whole range of different things. At the end of her article, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I just want the same as everyone else&mdash;the system to be fair. Women who work in the home are not a vocal group. They do not have strong representation in government. They do not sit on any government advisory boards. Very rarely do they get heard at all. The time has come for them to speak out. The system developed by the Labor Party and the Labor government stinks.</PARA>
<PARA>They were her words. That is another example of how the Labor government has failed the families. The Labor government can also be linked to the mishandling of public funds. Do I have to remind the House of some recent court cases in Western Australia? The former Premier of Western Australia, Brian Burke, was gaoled, as was his Deputy Premier. Both of those gentlemen were gaoled for the mishandling of funds. The state banks of Victoria and South Australia are also examples of the mishandling of public funds. Of course WA Inc., as it was in those days, was all about the mishandling of funds. </PARA>

I remind the parliamentary secretary that we are not objecting to the legislation, but we are supporting an amendment to the motion for the second reading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to get some facts on the record, and I think it is very important that I do that. The government feels uncomfortable about this. It always says that it is the party for Australians, helping Australians. In a media release by my good colleague the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) headed `Not a very merry Christmas for all' he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One in 10 families in Australia has both parents out of work. Almost 19 per cent of Australia's children under 15 live in a family with no breadwinner. One-quarter of Australian families, that is 1.15 million, has no working member. The number of traditional families falling into the category of unemployed on welfare dependency rose 50 per cent from 1989 to 1993. The number of children&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>who, I believe, are part of families&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">who are members of families dependent on social security payments rose from approximately 620,000 in 1982 to 1.6 million in 1992. Poverty is increasing in almost every group except the aged. Over two million Australians now live below the poverty line, a rise of over 14 per cent since 1983. Of all Australians living in poverty, just over half come from traditional nuclear families.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the argument is conclusive. Members on the other side continue this rhetoric about how well they are handling the Australian public and Australian families. But they are not necessarily giving us the correct statistics, because we have statistics which disprove all of their arguments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate is an interesting one, as all matters affecting Australian families are. I want to join with my colleague the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in focusing on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill 1995 and the amendments in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the family allowance, or, if you like, the reintroduction of the maternity allowance&mdash;after it was abolished by the previous government under the then Treasurer, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)&mdash;is an important occasion in the life of this parliament, and an important occasion in the lives of Australian families, given that the parents of some 223,000 children born per year, or  85 per cent of those giving birth, will be eligible for the payment. That is an important point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments relating to the amalgamation of basic family payments, additional family payments, the alignment with Austudy and to the change in the responsiveness to increases and decreases in income are all quite relevant and coherent. They very much reinforce the rationale of the social wage notion that we as a government have pursued since March 1983. That did not come up last week or last month; it has been at the forefront of policy making since before 1983&mdash;before we were in government. We came into government promising things such as Medicare so we could look after the two million people who then were not insured. Throughout our time in government, it has been at the forefront of policy making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Moreton raised a few matters, and I wish to add to those. Look at issues like TEAS, the old tertiary education assistance scheme. It was introduced by the previous Labor government and left to languish as a result of neglect and decay in the Fraser era. It became way out of kilter with unemployment benefits and of course way out of kilter with family needs. The development of that scheme into Austudy and its extension to include eligibility for high school students in years 11 and 12 has had a massive effect on Australian families. In 1983 one in three school pupils stayed beyond year 10 at school. That was the norm for Australia under conservative governments. It is now something like four out five. Changes to and the enhancement of Austudy have been fundamental in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, one has to remember the old TEAS arrangements and also measures such as the rental allowance. In March 1983 the rental allowance was available to only people on pensions. It was $5 a week. But, for every dollar of non-pension income, pensioners lost 50c of that allowance. Once they began earning $10 a week from investments, super or anything else, the rent allowance was gone. So it applied to very few people. As I said, it was $5 a week 12 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Moreton referred to the increase in child-care places and there being some four or five times as many. It is indicative. Think also about the age pension. In 1975, when the previous Labor government was dismissed from office, the age pension was running at almost 26 per cent of average weekly earnings. In March 1983 it was down to 21 1/2 per cent. Seven years of conservative government dropped it by about 20 per cent or a little more. Now it is back to almost 26 per cent. That is just an indication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recall so well the system we inherited, because of the problems I had as a member representing my constituents. I was informed of pensioners paying tax on earnings above $3 a week. At one stage in the mid-1980s, people paid tax on anything over that. The confusion and chaos that caused for our older people was massive. Now there is a tax-free zone of $47 a week per single pensioner. One would not recognise the system. That is all part of the social wage, and it is about families. In those days many Australian workers supported aged members of their family because the government did not support them well enough. That does not happen as much any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall that one of my constituents, a pensioner, was paying $40 of his pension towards the cost of his wife staying in a nursing home. He lived on dog food and cat food. For eight years he paid $40 from his pension every week for his wife to stay in a nursing home&mdash;and we get nonsense from those opposite about poverty and about how caring they are. The rent allowance; Austudy; retention rates at school; Medicare, which has been touched on; child care; pensions; and the taxation rate&mdash;as mentioned yesterday by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and today by the Treasurer (Mr Willis), we dealt with tax rates of 60 per cent at the top margin and 30 per cent at the bottom; in fact, in 1983 the lowest tax people paid was 30c in the dollar, and now it is 20c&mdash;are all aspects which affect families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what do we have in response today? A `fill in the blanks' amendment. This amendment sheet gets recycled. The opposition obviously has a pro-forma document on a word processor that says, `Whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for'. With every piece of legislation relating to social security we get a fill in the blanks amendment sheet. On every occasion it is in the same form but the words are altered. The shadow minister for social security, the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), does not realise how farcical it is. He also does not realise that when I ask his colleagues, `Why do you guys persevere with your nonsense divisions on nonsense amendments?', they say, `When the bells ring, we know it is social security. We know it is the member for Berowra.' They tell us that, although they might not tell him. Perhaps they should, because he might realise that this stuff is absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister talked about the need for the government to disclose its policies. That was answered to some degree by the member for Moreton, but let us go a little further. The public is being told that the opposition will not release its policies until an election is in the wind, in the offing, virtually called, for two reasons: one, the government will steal the policies and/or, two, we might run a scare campaign. The fact is that, if the policies are so frightening, why would we steal them? What an absolute nonsense&mdash;those opposite will not release their policies because we might steal them or else have a scare campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latter part is possibly right because at the moment the opposition's policies are still that people will be thrown off the dole after nine months and kids in the work force will be paid $3 an hour. Those are still the opposition's policies. If we look, as I have, at the opposition's record prior to 1983 and at its policies over the four elections since 1983, we see that its policies are pretty frightening. The opposition probably does not want them out in the open. They probably would scare voters. Opposition members think they can get away with keeping their policies submerged and then at the same time talk about our policies not being announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have policies. We are doing things. But we get this, as I said, fill in the blanks amendment sheet week after week, month after month. It was okay for the first year. We thought it was fair enough because the shadow minister was trying to get his act together and, as a party, those opposite were a bit dishevelled after what happened to them. But this is two years later. That was March 1993. One would have thought that the aftershock of the 1993 cataclysm or earthquake in the conservative side would have settled down by now. I concede that those opposite may have changed their leader a few times and endured things of that nature, but the shadow minister has been the same. The policy maker has been the same, but he is still re-running the same kinds of policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) talk about a wide range of issues. I was fascinated by his analysis of Labor factions and machinations. Both he and the member for Berowra referred to documents from QCOSS and I think also ACOSS. I have sat in public hearings with the member for Berowra when he has interviewed witnesses from ACOSS. I have seen the respect he gave them and the wonderful credibility he afforded them as witnesses and what they brought forward. I have seen how he treated their recommendations and their ideas. I know very well what he thinks of ACOSS. Locally, one of the first actions of the new ACT Liberal government was to de-fund the ACTCOSS. In other words, the equivalent state body in the ACT has now been de-funded by a Liberal government in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members expect us to sit here and listen to them put forward ACOSS as an authority and expect us to take them seriously after having watched how they treat such organisations. I would have thought that equated very closely to the `community voices' the member for Cowan referred to in his remarks. He talked about Labor factions, machinations and `community voices' in certain issues. It sounds as though he is referring to organisations such as ACOSS and QCOSS. That is the impression one got from the conservatives when those organisations were before public parliamentary committee hearings over the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the member for Cowan suggested that we supply a lot of money. I am surprised at that because I got the impression from what he said that we were not doing that. If he thinks things are still difficult despite these increases, changes and improvements in circumstances, how will he explain the substantial cuts that the opposition's budget projections will require if the projected fiscal and monetary policy outcomes are to be met?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The projections put forward by the opposition to deal with Australia's current economic circumstances are fundamentally to cut government expenditure. We have watched the Republicans in America increase their defence by buying two Stealth bombers that were not even asked for. I cannot see defence being cut in Australia, given the membership of the party opposite. There are a whole lot of areas you cannot cut because of payments to the states. Given the opposition's insistence that states get a better deal, I cannot see their payments being cut. The major area for potential cuts is welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those opposite to lecture us about what we are doing to support Australian families is hypocritical, and the words that would define it probably are not parliamentary. We have been here now for five terms. I increasingly hear those opposite in a short chorus. It reminds me of a few years ago and a former member for Richmond. Week after week he would lecture us and individually point to members and say, `You won't be here after the election.' It went on for about three months. The fact is that he was the one who went. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next few months until the election will be an interesting time. The opposition says, `We can't show you our policy because it might frighten the community and you will run a scare campaign.' The fact is that you cannot frighten people unless the policies are potentially frightening. Those opposite cannot have it both ways. The policies are either frightening or non-existent. In one sense, I suspect they are both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the next few months while those opposite get increasingly arrogant, confident and certain of their success. That has happened every time since 1983. This is the fifth time that we as a government have gone back to our community and sought their mandate. When we do that, we do it openly and in a straightforward manner. Our community is pretty tough minded.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst those opposite have the view that that is the way it is working, I feel even more comfortable. The member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) and the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) were here last time. They can recall the last months of the last parliament, the euphoria over the launch of Fightback. Most of us sat back and relaxed and felt very comfortable while those opposite went through those hot flushes.

I am feeling very comfortable because, obviously, I have much more faith in the community out there than the opposition has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are important. They reintroduce the maternity allowance, which will be a major landmark feature of Australian social policy. It is a feature which I expect will be enhanced and built on in the years ahead.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of this parliament, and right up to the next election, the opposition has taken, and will take, every opportunity to remind the Australian people that this government lied its way back into office at the last election. That is the only reason it was re-elected, and it will be held accountable at the next election for the lies that it told. We will point to lie after lie. In respect of the latest budget, our actions are a response to the government's attempt to mislead the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are opposing a number of tax increases simply because they were the tax increases which the Australian people were told unequivocally would not occur. We now have tax increases on a wide range of things which directly affect families. The member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) came in and said how proud he was of this government's record on families. The fact is that he has nothing to be proud of. At the next election&mdash;and, like the member for Newcastle, I am waiting with great anticipation for it&mdash;I believe the Australian people will finally consign this government to the scrap heap where it belongs. One of the reasons for their doing that will be the legacy this government has left Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest budget has had a dramatic effect on families. The Medicare levy has been put up once again. At one stage we were told quite clearly by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) that the Medicare levy would not go up. It has gone up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What effect does the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), who is sitting at the table, think that has on families? Obviously, for most average families, it is an additional impost. This government is putting sales taxes up. We asked questions about that in question time today. We have managed in the Senate to block the new sales tax, the expanded sales tax, on a range of fixtures and fittings for homes which would have made houses between $1,000 and $3,000 more expensive for families. Fortunately, with the support of the Australian Democrats in the Senate, we have managed to stop that imposition on families and average hardworking couples who are trying to purchase a home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its latest budget, the government has made cars more expensive. Who purchases cars? Families very often purchase cars, and they have become more expensive. This government's promised tax cuts were not delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real coup de grace for this government in terms of families has been the damning evidence which we have seen in recent times that the rich have got richer while the poor have got poorer. The evidence of that is in the Gregory report, which has been alluded to in here in debates on a number of occasions. It is quite incontrovertible. But the answer to the question that we get from the Labor Party, and from the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) when he is asked dorothy dix questions in here frequently about that matter, is, `We've expanded the social wage. We've got this great new concept now called the social wage.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all very well, but the problem in our country today is that too many people are actually on the social wage. The fact that so many people have become dependent on government handouts and welfare is a legacy of this Labor government. I believe that it will be a very long time before people will be given the opportunity to be in control of their own lives. Many people have simply been locked into that so-called social wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is a positive thing for the Minister for Social Security to stand up in this place and crow about the social wage. If we were to ask many of the people who have been forced into accepting the social wage, I think we would find they would rather not be dependent and would rather take care of their own affairs. Those people do not want to be on the government payroll. It is not to this government's credit that it can point to its great achievements with respect to this so-called social wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report has recently been done on poverty in Queensland, my home state. Many families in Queensland have also been affected by the federal government's failure to deal with the family policy. Queensland has the lowest average weekly disposable income. Sole parent families, couples with three or more children and young single people have the greatest chance of being in poverty. One fifth, or 20 per cent, of the Queensland population now lives in poverty. Some 18 per cent, or 350,000 Queenslanders, live below the poverty line. Some 26 per cent, or 136,000, of those in poverty are children. Some 27.2 per cent of elderly people live in poverty. Two out of three sole parents exist below the poverty line.

Many businesses have been forced into bankruptcy because of the recession we had to have. The insensitivity of that comment is only exceeded slightly by the suggestion recently that we have never had it so good. There are still many small businesses in my electorate that are suffering. Many of those small businesses are run by families. They can hardly make ends meet, even though they are working 80 hours a week. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) then has the gall to tell them that they have never had it so good and that if they cannot make it they should get out of business. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As though this was not already a very gloomy picture, what the government has done with its policies is engage in a massive exercise in social engineering. Families have been denied real choices in relation to the care of their children. There is a bias in the tax system against single income families. Many women who are now working&mdash;and the government trumpets its success in that area; it talks about increases in female participation in the work force&mdash;have actually been conscripted into the work force. You need only ask them to find out that that is the case. It is not their choice to be in the work force. It has been foisted upon them through economic necessity. It is no longer possible to live on one income in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that families are empowered in any way by becoming state mendicants. That is the position which many families have been placed in as a result of the actions of this government. Only the Labor Party could dream up a child-care system which does not allow a child to be cared for in his or her own home by a parent. Why is a woman who stays at home to take care of her family regarded as a second-class citizen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Every economic recognition for families, other than the poorest, is being gradually eroded by Labor Party policy. The wage system does not recognise dependency in any sense because dependency is out. The tax system no longer allows for dependants. The tax system does not allow families tax deductions for rates; health insurance, which many families want to have; or chemist bills, which represent a huge cost for many families. The family payment which replaced child endowment&mdash;and we are told that that is a proud achievement of this Labor government&mdash;is no longer universal. It is regarded as welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will not have long-term structurally sound prosperity while policy makers continue to wage economic warfare on families. Australia will be happier when women and their husbands are economically free to raise their families. Economic freedom has been taken away by this government and replaced by a huge system of dependency. Children will be happier when their parents no longer dread their responsibilities and feel compelled to juggle them by putting infants into nine-to-five child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's legacy, through its taxation and social security policies, is the dismantling of families. Even the word marriage is out of favour as far as the Labor government is concerned. People are now treated in the law as either individuals or partners in households. The family is not seen as a unit. The problem is that the government's feminist agenda seeks to end the economic interdependence of husbands, wives and children. The extreme feminists that are running the agenda for the government have real hang-ups about the natural functions of mothering and raising children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that this issue is on the agenda because it is relevant to the destruction and breakdown of families that has occurred. I was interested to read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last Thursday an article by Jillian Abbott. I do not know Jillian Abbott.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But by idealising the father archetype at the expense of the mother archetype, old-guard feminists have compounded the devaluation of women and motherhood, and have deprived women of choice.</PARA>

<PARA>She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was younger, feminism made sense. I was born a rebel, and feminism was rebellion. Now it's the status quo. When I grew up, married and had children, I reflected that my rebel days were probably over.</PARA>

<PARA>She concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Feminism would be far more constructive and relevant if the old guard used their power to address the concerns of all women instead of just the anointed few. But as things stand, a good deal of their power is devoted to crushing younger rivals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is bad for all women.</PARA>
<PARA>The whole direction in which family policy has gone is essentially flawed. The roles of men and women are not interchangeable. One only has to visit a labour ward in a hospital to realise this, and no amount of affirmative action will change that. What we have had is crude social engineering by this government over many years. We have a system in place now where wives under 40 whose husbands are unemployed do not get a partner allowance. The partner allowance is not politically correct. Instead, they have to go on the dole; otherwise they are forced to look for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maternity allowance is another aspect of the bill which we are debating tonight. That allowance of $800 will do very little at all to help families. As the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) said, the amount of the allowance is considerably less than that which was agreed to and which was in effect promised. It is only a token. This government has been very good over the years at tokenism, and this is another example of that. The maternity allowance, along with many of these other handouts to families, will be funded out of tax increases which ironically make it more difficult for the average young father to support his wife and baby at a time when that financial support is most needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's social engineering has brought about this redistribution of income: it goes to the tax office and the social security department and then it ultimately goes back to the place where it came from in the first place, except it is in the form of welfare. But the difference is that this circuitous route&mdash;that is, taking the money off the families in the first place and then giving them back only a portion of that amount&mdash;effectively breaks down the whole family relationship. I can only assume that that circuitous route, which is driven by a social engineering agenda, is absolutely intentional. If the government wanted to break down and damage families over the 12 years that it has been in office, then it can certainly claim to have succeeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear from my own perspective and that of the opposition that our solution is not, as the member for Newcastle says, to cut welfare. That will not be possible. It is entrenched. But, over a period, the culture will have to change. We will have to get back to the point where families are allowed to exist without the intrusion of government. They do not need it. Most of them do not want it. But the fact is that they have been forced into accepting it in one form or another. It will take a very long time&mdash;perhaps a generation&mdash;to reverse all of that and bring about a situation where families are once again left in peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have been forced onto welfare via the so-called social wage. Some 76 per cent of all unemployed are men, many of whom have been destroyed by that experience of unemployment. They are unable to provide for their families because the government steps in and does it for them. But what effect does this have on those men and their morale? What effect does it have on their natural inclination to want to care for their families&mdash;their wives and their children? It has a devastating effect. </PARA>

It is anticipated that this draft will represent the voice of local government in Far North Queensland, and in part it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the French refusal to respond positively to the concerns of Pacific nations about nuclear testing in their region, the North Queensland Local Government Association requests the Commonwealth Government to initiate direct action to stop the testing. Specifically, this Association proposes that Australia, as head of the Pacific Forum, organise and lead a fleet of unarmed ships from Pacific nations to the testing site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed that this fleet form the nucleus of a large flotilla of commercial, fishing and pleasure </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 20 per cent of Queenslanders living in poverty. Whilst those figures are old, clearly they would be higher now which means that more than 20 per cent of Queensland's population is living in poverty. Hospital waiting lists are exploding, with public meetings being held in four major centres in North Queensland. The Townsville general hospital, which was the second biggest hospital in Queensland&mdash;and I think it still might be&mdash;in fact, has had over 200 beds taken away by the federal government; that hospital has gone from 560 beds down to 340 beds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Switching tack completely in the few minutes I have left and available to me, it has been strongly advocated by William Wentworth, a long time minister and member of parliament in this House, that the federal government reintroduce primage as a means of raising revenue. Article 12 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade, GATT:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the textile, footwear and clothing industries, the motor vehicle industry and my own industries, the banana and sugar industries of North Queensland&mdash;particularly the banana industries. This government&mdash;and it never ceases to stagger me and I can feel the anger rise in me every time I think about it&mdash;takes sugar into this country. Without any restrictions upon it whatsoever, the government allows sugar to come in here from the European Community, wherein are the world's biggest sugar producers and exporters, carrying upon it a tariff of 192 per cent. They are not my figures of 192 per cent but figures from the report to the President of the United States on tariff and trade 1990, at page 2776, if my memory serves me correctly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, with bananas we have to compete against people working in abject slavery. I cannot help but use the word `slavery' when you are being paid, in our day and age, $2 a day wages to work. The governments in South and Central America have attempted to stand up to the economic might of the United States but they have been crushed and the governments overthrown on many occasions with gunboat diplomacy. The intervention in the overthrowing of governments in Central and South America by the notorious United States company called the United Fruit Co., now called Chiquita, which is now here in Australia, is a matter of public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are asked to compete at an equal level. We have two choices in the banana industry&mdash;wipe the industry out, worth $260 million a year to the Australian economy, or reduce wages to meet their wage levels. It staggers me but I honestly think the people running the government of Australia really do believe that we must use, in their own phrase, world best practice. World best practice in the banana industry means you work for $2 a day. There is hardly a single intelligent worker in Queensland who does not believe that this is what this Labor government is about. That is why the polls are reading 62 per cent for the coalition and 38 per cent for Labor. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time, I guess all politicians get this sort of representation but, because I have had similar sorts of complaints, I did take it seriously and had a look through some of his material. I then said it was simply beyond me. I simply could not come to grips with 3,500 pages. But I said to him that, if he were to submit his documentation to a fellow who had offered to help me, a David Macdonald, who had at one time been a police prosecutor, and he were to determine that this guy had a case, I would then take it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After an enormous amount of effort, for which I am very thankful to Mr Macdonald, he has reduced that enormous number of pages down to 53, which goes to the nub of great injustice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am using parliamentary privilege because Mr McKechnie is a great user of legal privilege. If people think about it, legal privilege for someone in his position is far more powerful than parliamentary privilege. I, if I am lucky, can get 10 minutes a week; he can get any time he likes and he takes that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to illustrate that point, one of the things I find extremely unpleasant is that this case was, in effect, a company fraud matter, yet Mr Love was arrested no less than four times by Mr Ayton. On one occasion, he was arrested for the heinous crime of stealing a used envelope for which he was granted bail of $100. Before he was granted bail, Mr Ayton took him down to one of the police establishments and strip searched him. It seems that Mr Ayton had strip searched this fellow on four occasions on what were basically fraud charges. There were simply no grounds to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was extremely embarrassed about discussing it. I asked him what form it took. He said, `He made me take off all my clothes, including my wedding ring, then he would lick his biro and probe my testicles.' Very demeaning, I am sure, but totally unnecessary in the context of this sort of charge. The charge of stealing the used envelope was thrown out of court unceremoniously. It was simply a ground for intimidation and oppression&mdash;the sort of attitude that you would expect in Third World countries and which we all deplore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> in Western Australia, we had the headline `DPP feared theft charges'. This arises because I raised in this parliament the matter of the very preferential treatment Mr McKechnie's daughter got. All I can say is that Mr McKechnie has shifted his ground. What he viewed as an outrageous infringement of his children's privacy, he now concedes is a marginal case. So one might be justified in believing that anyone who steals&mdash;steals as a servant, I might add&mdash;less than $715 will not be charged because that will be submarginal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also add that since his other child got such significantly lenient treatment in a very serious case, Mr McKechnie is cleary very lucky. As Oscar Wilde observed, happen once is luck; happen twice is very lucky. I am concerned about this because these are the sorts of sneers you get. The article mentions a Sergeant Waghorn, a suspended police officer&mdash;suspended on absolutely spurious charges, I might add.

According to the catering profit and loss statement for the 1994 race, the gross catering profit achieved was $541,485.

Unfortunately, the 1995 outcome is not nearly so pleasant for the residents of Queensland. While the profit and loss statements are not yet available and the state Minister for Tourism, Sport and Racing, Mr Bob Gibbs, refuses to release any figures on this year's Indy event for fear of voter backlash during the current campaign period for the Queensland elections, figures quoted from government sources range from a paltry $30,000 to $35,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an appalling shortfall for the hardworking citizens of Queensland. The Goss government must account for the reasons it chose to change the successful catering arrangements.

Why did it allow the event to suffer such a turnaround in fortunes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has already been alleged in the Queensland parliament that Indy management may have `grossly misrepresented' the extent of profit open to catering companies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the first irregularity associated with the Indy car event.

<PARA>This was for a loan that, in effect, only lasted one day before it was forgiven in full. At 30 June 1993, the loan owed by the Gold Coast Motor Events Co.

The very next day&mdash;1 July 1993&mdash;the Queensland Treasury Department wrote the loan off as a bad debt! As a result, a taxation benefit was gained at the expense of every Australian taxpayer.

We have seen in recent times that one of the consequences of that ideological or civil war has been the member for Moore, Mr Filing, sitting as an Independent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members might recall that last week on Wednesday, 21 June I detailed a conversation that took place between the campaign director for the endorsed Liberal candidate for Moore, Mr Stevenage, and the endorsed Labor candidate for Moore. In the course of that conversation Mr Stevenage's campaign director, Mr Ehrenfeld, discussed a `put Filing last' campaign when he raised the question of preferences with the ALP candidate. He described Mr Filing as political poison and said he would rather see the ALP candidate in parliament than the present member for Moore. He also referred to the seat of Cowan and said that Carolyn Jakobsen was ahead of the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and that, if the member for Cowan did not improve over the next three months, he might not be there as a candidate at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the response to this? In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of Thursday, 22 June, it is reported that when those comments were put to Mr Ehrenfeld he confirmed the conversation and admitted referring to Mr Filing as `political poison'. The article states:</PARA>

<PARA>In the course of this article the member for Cowan is also referred to. He does not deny the substance of the suggestion, namely, that his preselection is up for review three months after his endorsement. On Friday, 23 June on ABC Radio, Mr Stevenage, in response to questions from the journalist, Mr Utting, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, there hasn't been any discussions between myself. There were a couple of conversations between my campaign director and the now endorsed ALP candidate and those discussions were about a whole range of issues, nothing to do with the Moore issue . . .</PARA>
<PARA>We have had an express denial by the endorsed Liberal candidate for Moore, Mr Stevenage, of a conversation which his campaign director had confirmed. Following that interview during a conversation on ABC Radio, Mr Richard Utting, the presenter, in referring to the Independent candidate for Moore, Mr Filing, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well it seems that that is one issue that is going to be a running sore for the Liberal Party.</PARA>

<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't think they've [handled] themselves very well or got out of it. They are not out of jail on this one.</PARA>
<PARA>Absolutely they are not out of gaol. One of the interesting sidelights in this matter is the failure of the member for Cowan to deny that his preselection is subject to review. In the course of the conversation between Mr Ehrenfeld and the ALP candidate for Moore, it was made clear that the member for Cowan's preselection was subject to a three-month review. The member for Cowan was endorsed on 12 April. It will be interesting to see whether on 12 July we have further repercussions of the civil war in the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party. In the course of these matters, I noticed that on 22 June the Independent member for Moore, Mr Filing, said this on ABC Radio:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the comments relating to the seat of Cowan and that of course is an additional worry because as you know Richard Evans there is on a knife edge margin and I would be very concerned if I were him about you know somebody on the state executive if they have been going to the Labor Party talking about preferences and if as reported in Mr Smith's speech actually giving the Labor Party confidential information to assist them in their work.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us see whether the member for Cowan will deny that his preselection is the subject of a three-month review.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The remarks I make tonight, I am sure, will not be quite as exciting as some of the remarks made by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) or those members who went before him, but they are somewhat more important to the future of this country and to those people who pay mortgages. I would like to draw the attention of the House to a country that has not been mentioned as often as Mexico and France have been this week&mdash;that is, Japan. I would also like to refer to the situation that is occurring with the banking and financial sector in that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been reported in the Australian media about the troubles in the balance sheets of the banks in Japan, in particular the city banks, really understates the position. In the last couple of days we have seen our dollar grow weaker on speculation of trouble in the Senate. This illustrates the fact that this week many foreign investors are less willing again to risk their wealth in Australia. It illustrates to me our vulnerability to rises in interest rates and trouble in foreign bond markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen the trouble looming in Japan. As I said, the situation in the banks in Japan is worse than has been reported. In the case of some Japanese banks, their capital is now exceeded by the amount of their non-performing loans, less the reserves that they have set aside for those loans, thus rendering them technically insolvent. This is the case with at least three of the large banks there. Further, four of the eight large housing loan companies in Japan are already technically insolvent and, in one case, a rescue has been undertaken by the ministry of finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we estimate Japan's total GNP at around Y475 trillion, the total non-performing loans of the financial sector is estimated at about Y60 trillion to Y80 trillion, which puts it at around 15 per cent of GNP. This is extraordinarily high. The figure for the worst period of the savings and loan crisis in the United States in the early 1990s was around eight or nine per cent. Yet in Japan, our biggest trading partner and possibly the largest holder of Australian bonds, that figure has reached 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a climate where the profitability of these banks is looking rather poor, to say the least&mdash;given the troubles with the earthquake in Kobe, the troubles with the religious sect, Aum Shinri Kyo, and the trade dispute with the United States about cars&mdash;you could say it is hardly likely that the banks' operating profits will improve in the next cycle. Therefore, the likelihood of serious difficulty with one of Japan's major banks is much greater than it was perhaps at any time in the last 20 years. It is quite plain that the banks' balance sheets are deteriorating quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, many Japanese banks&mdash;unlike Australian or American banks&mdash;have large holdings of Japanese shares. They traditionally take a two or three per cent stake in any of their larger customers which are listed on the stock exchange, although they are limited to a five per cent stake. What it has meant is that their capital is devoted to equities to a much greater extent than it is anywhere else in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Japanese stock index&mdash;the Nikkei 225&mdash;is now sitting at about 15,000. Given the very low return on equity and the fact that dividend yields are less than one per cent, you could fairly say that that index is still overvalued at 15,000. Yet these banks still hold large amounts of these equities in their customers. If it is overvalued at 15,000 and if fair value is perhaps 9,000 or 10,000 on that index, if that share market were to reach fair value it would render insolvent many of the smaller banks&mdash;especially the regional banks&mdash;which in turn would send a shock wave through the bond market, first of all in Japan. The likely consequences of that would be that the banks which hold Australian bonds and US dollar bonds would be forced to sell them and repatriate the capital back to Japan to shore up their balance sheets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw the House's attention to this matter because it has not been properly reported in our financial media. Given that we are looking at possibly a record current account deficit of between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion for May&mdash;which will be announced on Friday&mdash;we are more vulnerable than ever before. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Did Dr Stocker claim that Cassiro was a result of a less than optimal set of structures to determine commercial frameworks; if so, what is the basis for that claim.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Did Dr Stocker assert that the failure of certain CSIRO scientists adequately to discover documents during court proceedings was due to a laissez-faire attitude and inexperience rather than an intention to mislead the court, if so, will the Minister seek an independent review of the court proceedings and the eventual settlement to verify the assertion.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has been assured by senior CSIRO management that the commercialisation procedures now in place are suitable to prevent the recurrence of difficulties such as emerged in this matter. He believes CSIRO has acted responsibly in responding to these difficulties and should be supported in its aims of dedicating its resources to research rather than to the further exploration of these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH ORGANISATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relationship between CSIRO and Gerard Cassegrain &amp; Co Pty Limited ("GC&amp;Co") began in 1987, initially on a quite limited basis with a view to developing an improved machine for soil amelioration. The relationship later became directed principally towards the further development of two technologies originating within CSIRO, soil slotting and sewage disposal by means of vertical upflow artificial wetlands. Neither technology proved able, in practice, to generate a sufficient revenue flow during the course of the relationship. In the early stages both parties entertained very optimistic expectations as to prospects. Later, there was disagreement over the size of respective contributions, responsibilities for further funding, and the interpretation of the various agreements and understandings. Ultimately, the disagreements crystallised around the question whether the joint relationship for developing the two technologies should continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Court proceedings concerning the disputes were instituted in 1992, and a lengthy Federal Court hearing began on 26 October 1992, which continued, with interruptions, until 2 July 1993. The hearing was never finished and the Court did not reach conclusions on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a mediation before Sir Laurence Street, an accommodation was reached to enable termination of the proceedings, ending of the relationship, and transfer of the technologies to CSIRO, on the basis that this was not to be taken as reflecting in any way adversely on GC&amp;Co and Mr Cassegrain. Their contribution to the development of the two technologies was acknowledged. The confidentiality provisions that were agreed limited further public statements to the parties on the subject of the disputes, while acknowledging CSIRO's accountability obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aspects of the questions asked appear based on assumptions as to the legal relationship between GC&amp;Co and CSIRO and the resulting disputes. The nature and extent of the legal relationship between GC&amp;Co and CSIRO was the subject of the dispute explored, but not resolved, in the course of the Federal Court proceedings. No conclusions were reached by the Court on this aspect, nor was the collection of all evidence relevant to the disputes ever completed. Following the mediation before Sir Laurence Street, the parties conducted an extensive negotiation to document the accommodation reached. The parties to the Deed of Settlement and Release completed on 27 September 1993 between GC&amp;Co, Mr Claude Cassegrain and CSIRO and Sirotech Limited ("Sirotech") (the "Settlement Deed") agreed, without admission of liability by any of them, to resolve all disputes between them that were or could become the subject of the Federal Court proceedings, together with all other disputes that had arisen or might arise, directly or indirectly, from or otherwise in connection with, any dealing, occurrence, transaction or representation between them occurring prior to completion of the settlement on 27 September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some areas, a common position was reached in the course of documenting the Settlement Deed. In other areas, the parties, in effect, agreed to differ, and reached a practical resolution which did not involve any conclusion as to the underlying disputes that had previously existed. The Settlement Deed released all claims between the parties in respect of any dealing, occurrence, transaction or representation occurring prior to 27 September 1993 and included covenants by the parties that they would not initiate or continue any claim or demand in respect of the matters the subject of the releases, would not encourage or assist any other party to do so, and would use their best endeavours to procure that their Associates did not do so. The Settlement Deed was entered into with a view to avoiding any occasion for further issues between the parties to the settlement relating to the prior disputes or prior areas of potential dispute. This introduction explains the general nature of the issues that emerged and the manner in which the Organisation has addressed the need to ensure that these issues do not recur. As the parties have resolved the resulting disputes and many cannot be examined without comments on the position of individuals in areas where the inquiries associated with the Court proceedings were not completed, it is not considered useful or desirable to explore the details of the many allegations made during the Court proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the questions relate to specific claims and allegations made by GC&amp;Co in proceedings G3062 and G3095 in the Federal Court. The hearing of the proceedings continued for many months but conclusions resolving these matters were not reached by the Court or, in most cases, in the Settlement Deed. It was agreed in the Settlement Deed to resolve the disputes without admission of liability and without reaching any specific factual conclusions as to most of the disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the questions contain imputations as to the motives and purposes of CSIRO or Sirotech personnel, which cannot fairly be answered comprehensively, having regard to the termination of the Court proceedings. To compile all the relevant material on many of these specific issues, it would be necessary to devote very large resources to analyse the court transcript and the many relevant documents. Any individuals upon whom there was adverse reflection would need, as a matter of fairness, to be given an opportunity to state their position. Essentially, the Organisation would be taking on the role of a Court in trying to determine the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with these issues, CSIRO encountered problems to which it had never previously been exposed. The written agreements between the parties did not provide a clear and detailed guidance as to their respective rights and obligations in the situation that had developed by 1991. In some respects the relationship had developed apart from the written agreements and the identification of relevant intellectual property was inadequate or misunderstood. In key areas, there was no provision for resolution of disputes and there were factual and legal difficulties in quantifying contributions that had been made and further contribution obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The early accounts of the disputes between CSIRO, Sirotech and GC&amp;Co that were given to senior management and CSIRO's legal advisers by the personnel directly involved in the relationship appeared to indicate that CSIRO and Sirotech representatives had tried, for some time after the difficulties arose, to make the relationship work. Only after many months of Court proceedings and additional disclosures of large volumes of documents did a picture emerge that indicated that, in some respects, some CSIRO and Sirotech personnel had not, looking at the overall situation, displayed the standards of judgement and conduct to which the Organisation aspires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this became clear, the CSIRO Board established a sub-committee and the sub-committee and senior management devoted substantial time and effort to developing an appropriate response, and resolving the dispute. By that time, the hearing of the Court proceedings had already continued for some eight months (with interruptions) at massive cost to all concerned. The cross-examination of each individual witness often took many weeks and many allegations were made during cross-examination. As the evidence stood at that time, there was support for some, but not all, of these allegations. Whether this would have remained the situation at the conclusion of the hearing is impossible to say. Some of the main witnesses remained to be called, and others needed to be recalled. Continuation of the Court proceedings would also have necessitated further detailed inquiries within the Organisation and the compilation of additional evidence to explain and amplify some of the matters that had emerged during cross-examination. Mediation before Sir Laurence Street and the negotiation of over two months which led to the Settlement Deed offered an alternative to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before and after the settlement was reached, senior management examined what had occurred and considered appropriate responses. The mediation and Settlement Deed identified a monetary sum of $9.5 million agreed to by GC&amp;Co, Mr Cassegrain, CSIRO and Sirotech in comprehensive discharge of all claims and rights in respect of the relevant technologies and all claims relating to all the allegations made in the Court proceedings and associated costs.</PARA>

Senior management did not exhaustively investigate all the circumstances surrounding the various inadequacies identified but informed itself sufficiently to form the view that they may well have been occasioned by honest misunderstanding rather than deliberate misconduct. Senior management was concerned at the ignorance and misunderstandings that had occurred in relation to the obligation to produce documents for the purposes of the court proceedings, drew to the attention of all those involved its concern at the inadequate approach adopted, and resolved, in any future litigation, to ensure that more satisfactory procedures and approaches were adopted.</PARA>

Large expense and disruption to continuing research would have been occasioned by a sufficiently detailed inquiry into individual culpability associated with the problems identified. It appeared that the costs and expenses of further inquiry into those matters would be disproportionate to any additional lessons that might be learnt for the future. The general assessments of those involved, at senior CSIRO management level, suggested that, from the perspective of individual officers, there were likely to be many factors that could mitigate individual culpability for conduct causing or contributing to the problems in the relationship. </PARA>
