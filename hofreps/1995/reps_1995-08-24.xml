<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Defence Cooperation Control Bill I am introducing today seeks to establish a very clear fundamental principle as a foundation for Australia's defence links with other nations. It seeks to reinforce the primacy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as the basis for Australia's domestic and international policies and actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a very proud record of achievement of human rights both at home and abroad. We are widely perceived as good `international citizens' who have consistently pursued peace, freedom, democracy and observance of human rights for the whole period of our nationhood. Australians hold these principles very dearly and tens of thousands of our men and women have sacrificed their lives during the 20th century so other people around the world could enjoy the same rights and freedoms that we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes that Australian defence forces should not engage in any cooperative arrangements with the armed forces of any nation which uses those forces as a deliberate instrument of state policy to deny basic human rights to its own people or people of another state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definitions contained in the bill are very clear and concise. Basic human rights are determined as those set out in the internationally accepted Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Defence cooperation is any exercise, training or exchange of information, technology or personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that we as a nation should work with the armed forces of another nation when they are used to suppress the very rights of people which our defence forces are established to protect. This bill does not seek to interfere in the internal operations of another nation; it purely keeps us at arms length from its abusive power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedure to implement this principle is set out in the bill. A certificate would be issued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs giving a clearance to the Minister for Defence and the chief of the defence forces to participate in defence cooperation arrangements with a particular nation. This certificate would only be issued once the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, using its representatives in diplomatic posts in that nation, is satisfied that it is not a deliberate state policy to use its armed forces to suppress human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This certificate would be a disallowable instrument thereby allowing scrutiny of the process by the parliament. The certificate can be reviewed at any time that it appears the policies of that nation have changed and can be revoked. There is a clause in the bill which would ensure that the operation of this process would not interfere in our nation's capacity to contribute to UN peacekeeping or defence operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the majority of Australians support the principles behind this bill. They do not want to see our fine international record as a good world citizen corrupted through any defence links with nations that do not uphold basic human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject the argument that through such defence links Australia is better able to influence the practices of those armed forces or to educate them towards protecting human rights. The use of armed forces to suppress rights and liberties is a policy of the particular government and it is therefore the governments of those nations we should pursue. This bill is a reasonable, concise and principled proposal which deserves the support of the House. </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)takes note of the Queensland Council of Social Services report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drawing the line on poverty</EMPHASIS> which shows that Queensland is the most poverty-stricken State in Australia with 350000 people living in poverty; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)calls on all Australian governments to address the issue of poverty and the growing gap between rich and poor in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to see the shadow minister for social security in the chamber because he raised aspects of this matter in a recent MPI. Poverty is alive and well in the sunshine state. As a Queenslander, that is something I say with not much pride. That is a statement of Peter Walsh, the director of the Queensland Council of Social Service and one of the principal authors of a recent report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drawing the line on poverty</EMPHASIS>. The report gives us a disturbing insight into the raw statistics, the human face of poverty and the disadvantage being experienced in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last decade, Queensland has been the leading state in terms of economic growth, and industrial and business investment. However, not everyone has shared equally in that success. The report demonstrates that poverty and disadvantage are often hidden or marbled through the community. The report demonstrates that the social safety net is not working, despite the chest beating of the government and members opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report highlights this government's failure to adequately address the public housing and health needs of even the most needy in our community. The report demonstrates the growing dependence of welfare agencies on emergency relief funding at a time when the federal government is actually cutting back on such assistance. Far from the rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about helping the battlers, this report demonstrates that, in reality, the government has ignored the battlers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drawing the line on poverty</EMPHASIS> was conducted essentially in three parts: a breakdown of national socioeconomic statistics for Queensland based on ABS and 1991 census data; the 1994 survey of more than 300 church and community organisations throughout Queensland providing emergency assistance; and case studies of five diverse areas of Queensland where low income people relying on emergency relief were interviewed directly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main statistical findings of this report have already been highlighted in the media and in this parliament by the shadow minister, as I said. For the purpose of this debate, I would like to give a quick reminder to all those opposite of some of the key facts. Eighteen per cent, or almost one fifth, of the Queensland population live in poverty. The Queensland poverty rate is two per cent greater than the national average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After housing costs are taken out, 350,000 Queenslanders are living below the poverty line. Of this, almost 137,000 are children living in families below the poverty line, which represents 26 per cent, or just over a quarter, of Queensland children. Elderly people have a before housing poverty rate of 27.2 per cent and 24.6 per cent, or almost a quarter, of young people under 25 years live in poverty. Two in three sole parents exist below the poverty line and the average weekly disposable income is lower in Queensland than in the other states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the statistics. They are very revealing statistics. They are statistics which Queenslanders can take no pride in. While some of those opposite might dismiss these figures as being somewhat dated, let us remember that this is the most current data available. While, like those members opposite, I wait to see the results of the 1996 census, I will be the first to applaud if they are better. But if the trend in poverty follows the trend in unemployment along the Queensland coast then it will not be a pretty picture. Even so, let us take a look at the two other components of the report which are based on surveys conducted just last year, 1994, of low income people who are living below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us first look at emergency relief. The poverty research looks at who relies on&mdash;and why they do&mdash;emergency assistance to supplement their low incomes; that is, emergency relief provided by the Commonwealth and some states to church and community welfare organisations, like the Salvation Army, Lifeline, women's crisis centres, Aboriginal and Islander housing cooperatives, and so on. This is probably the most damning part of the poverty report. It demonstrates that the government's much heralded social wage or safety net is ineffectual for a great many battlers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Declaring a single example of the failure of the government's social wage is a finding that, of 2,556 people surveyed between August and September 1994 who received emergency relief, 2,118 or 82.2 per cent of them received a government pension or benefit. I repeat: 82 per cent of people who received emergency aid in Queensland were already reliant on government benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also highlight the plight of the other 18 per cent who do not rely on government benefits and who are the real battlers in the community. The government's insensitivity to this group was highlighted just yesterday in this House with the passing of a budget measure that increases the safety net for pharmaceutical benefits from $400 to $600. You might recall that not so many years ago it was $312. That means that you have to be twice as sick as you were five years ago to get the safety net. That also means that those people who are on fixed incomes, many of whom are in that 18 per cent category, would be suffering from that measure and would possibly be cutting back on their medicinal requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to the 82 per cent receiving government benefit. The biggest group demanding emergency assistance were the unemployed, making up 38 per cent of the total, followed by sole parents, making up 24 per cent. The survey also found that the majority of requests for emergency assistance were for basic living needs, including food, 23.1 per cent, and housing related costs, 23.8 per cent, which were cited as the two most common reasons. Requests for assistance for gas, electricity and water bills made up 22 per cent, with the biggest single reason for cash assistance coming from families with children. Medical expenses counted for seven per cent of requests, but again these mainly came from families with children&mdash;and that highlights the point I made earlier about the safety net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other revealing part of the poverty survey was the response of the welfare agency workers&mdash;those at the human coalface, if you like. Welfare workers regarded the severe shortage of public housing as one of the most critical issues impacting on the level of demand for emergency relief, in particular for young people and single parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June of this year, in the city of Gladstone, in my electorate, Ray Chapman of the Careforce community housing scheme had 60 people on his waiting list. He reports getting, basically, two categories of people presenting themselves for housing assistance: single women with one child, and single people trying to subsist on government benefits. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its very difficult to find accommodation for young single people&mdash;theyre discriminated against in many ways. It's pretty difficult to survive on $150 a week.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the more pertinent comments from a survey respondent was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Emergency relief is and will continue to be income supplement unless the structural causation of disadvantage is addressed. Emergency relief is a misnomer and an inadequate substitute for Social Security equity.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that says it all. Agency workers themselves comment on the inadequacy of the  existing levels of pensions and benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I recognise that emergency relief is largely a bandaid measure, I find it extraordinary that the Commonwealth is slashing this funding while it is doing nothing to rectify the situation of thousands of desperate people who rely on these handouts to survive. Total funding under the Commonwealth emergency relief program has been halved in the last three years, from $30.2 million in 1992-93 to $14.8 million in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This alone in my electorate of Hinkler has resulted in agencies having their funding cut from between 9.3 per cent and a massive 30 per cent. That is despite the fact that the Wide Bay-Burnett and Capricorn regions have the worst unemployment rates in Queensland and amongst the worst in the nation. In Wide Bay-Burnett, for instance, the unemployment rate is 13.6 per cent. In June this year, DEET figures revealed that the unemployed youth seeking full-time employment represented 41.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, many of these organisations have reacted strongly to the latest cut in emergency aid. Kenneth Young, from the Bundaberg Housing Action Group, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bundaberg people in desperate need of assistance will be disadvantaged by the decrease in funding allocations.</PARA>
<PARA>The Gladstone Salvation Army Captain David Pullen said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this will put our resources under greater strain . . . the shortfall of more than $2000 represented about 40 families the funds would have helped.</PARA>
<PARA>Cedric Williams, from the Gladstone Aboriginal and Islander Cooperative, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many times our own staff have had to put their hands in their own pockets to meet the needs of people here, but the government doesn't recognise that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate in this debate on poverty, and I certainly congratulate the Queensland Council of Social Service and the Sisters of Mercy who were sponsors of this research report. I believe it is very important to have a dialogue and a debate. There is a great deal of information on issues such as social inequality and there are many new studies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing we need to draw attention to is the fact that this is pretty rich coming from an opposition who, when they were last in government, saw the real value of pensions decrease by two per cent and the value of the social wage decrease by 17.5 per cent under the then Treasurer, who is now the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the poverty survey that was referred to by my colleague the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), the important issue that we do have to recognise is that the ABS figures, on which much of the data is based, are six years old. Since 1990, the Commonwealth government has substantially increased the real value of social security and pensions. For example, the income of a single pensioner renting privately has increased from six per cent to 13 per cent above the Henderson poverty line. The income of a sole parent who has two children and is renting privately has increased from nine per cent below to two per cent above the Henderson poverty line. The income of an unemployed couple who have one child and are renting privately has increased from 11 per cent below to one per cent above the Henderson poverty line. So there has been a substantial change in income support measures from the Commonwealth to the group that the member for Hinkler is concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that I think we do have to understand is the nature of the measure on which the report is based. The Henderson poverty line was designed in the 1960s by Ronald Henderson. It is an all or nothing measure, which nominates a point on the income scale below which people are understood to be in poverty. Since that time, disposable income has risen much faster than inflation, so an income on the poverty line in 1990-91 bought one-fifth more goods and services than 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if you use the Henderson poverty line to measure poverty, you might assess that poverty has increased over the eighties by one-third. In using alternative measures, the poverty rate has in fact fallen by about seven per cent. I think this has been emphasised by the recent work done by Anne Harding at the University of Canberra's National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. I want to quote from the excellent article by Deborah Hope in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 3-4 June, covering issues such as social inequality. Her article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to Harding's estimate about 1.8 million Australians, including half a million children, are living below the poverty line&mdash;a tally significantly lower than the figure of 2.5 million of five years ago. Harding suggests one reason for this may be that social security payments have been improved in recent years to lift many welfare recipients on maximum benefits over the poverty threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, I believe a number of our arrangements in the life and term of this government have contributed to the wellbeing of many families. One could point to the parenting allowance. All of these have been indexed. Indeed, yesterday the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) announced new increases in maternity allowance and pensions and the indexations from 20 September of this year so that single pensioners will receive $9.80 more per fortnight and each member of a pensioner or allowee couple will receive $8.20 more per fortnight. This means, for example, that the new parenting allowance, which was introduced only last month, will be increased by $8.20 to $280.20 per fortnight. The maternity allowance, which is equal to six weeks maximum parenting allowance, will be $840.60 when it is first paid next February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made a definite and determined contribution to make sure that pensions and benefits are indexed according to the cost of living, which is something the Fraser government never did and caused this decrease in income support. Additional family payment and basic family payment, which goes to the battlers as well as to the social security beneficiaries, is also a very important part of the social wage component. So there are a number of ways in which this government has made a huge and definite contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important issues is the attack on unemployment in this term of government. It is obviously the greatest challenge to social inequality. It should be recorded that since March 1983 this Labor government has created two million jobs. Indeed, we came back into government in 1993 with a firm commitment from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to deal with issues such as long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very proud record that over the last two years employment growth has been outstanding, with 670,000 more Australians in jobs compared with 1993 figures and, particularly, a drop in the number of long-term unemployed people by 21 per cent. So, if you look at a range of information, you will see that the picture is much better than is being suggested by a number of opposition spokespersons. One of the reasons for this is the value of the social wage and non-cash payments. I refer once again to Hope's article, because she was actually looking at whether there is an underclass in this country. Page 14 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A review of the evidence, however, together with interviews with people living in disadvantaged areas on low incomes, suggest that although unemployment means inequality is increasing in Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and there are many reasons for this inequality in terms of market incomes for people, and they relate to technological change and the structural changes in the nature of work and job categories&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there is no underclass, principally because our social safety net&mdash;including income support, assistance for low-income families, Medicare, housing, training programs and counselling . . . is working.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the housing issue in the Queensland poverty survey, it is important to recall that a great deal of the statistical data was collected just after the Goss Labor government had been installed. Effectively what you were looking at was a poverty situation that related very much to 30 years of neglect by the National Party government in Queensland. For example, the public housing stock is only 3.6 per cent of households. That is obviously a crucial test of poverty. Since 1988 the number of public dwellings in Queensland has increased by more than 60 per cent. So the Goss Labor government is moving to rectify that very low incidence of public housing, which of course is a major housing issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that is important to look at is who is benefiting from the Department of Social Security initiatives and our job creation programs. If we look at the figures that relate to December last year, we see those in the youth category who register as being out of work&mdash;a category referred to by the member for Hinkler&mdash;receive support for about 10 months. Indeed, the more difficult group is the people who are aged 45 years and older. Only 10 per cent of young people in the 18- to 24-year category have been out of work for more than a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great challenge to meet those needs. Our youth training initiative is designed to meet the concerns and the needs of that group. I believe we are winning that war. I refer to the book of Travers and Richardson entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living decently: material wellbeing in Australia</EMPHASIS>. It says that the present standards of living in Australia have never been equalled. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is true whether we look at real purchasing power per person . . . at standards of housing and extent of education, at the quality of medicine, the extent of support of people who have few resources of their own and at equality of opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>An EPAC review indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paper notes that a 30 per cent overall rise in Australians' standard of living in the past 12 years, as well as social progress in childcare, Medicare, tax reform, training, compulsory superannuation and improved payments to low-income families in the eighties and nineties.</PARA>
<PARA>It also includes growth in jobs and wages and indicates employment growth and productivity gains are also helping. These are the very policies of a Labor government over 12 years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wholeheartedly support the call of the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) for the growing gap between rich and poor in our country to be urgently addressed, because to date this government has had neither the political integrity to recognise the problem nor the political will to address it. No politician who takes the time to meet and talk with the people they represent has the luxury of believing, in the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), that `this is a golden age'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is a golden age for some, for a large and growing number it is an age of financial struggle, despair and unrealised potential. The level of poverty in our country is simply unacceptable. The central conclusion of the Queensland Council of Social Service's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drawing the line on poverty</EMPHASIS> is that poverty in Australia is not the condition of an isolated few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While I recognise that the member for Hinkler's motion asks that the House specifically take note of this report and of poverty in Queensland, as a South Australian I am only too familiar with the fact that poverty is a national problem. As the situation in Queensland seems to indicate, the combination of federal and state Labor governments does not bode well for a state. South Australia has only recently emerged from the dark years of the Bannon Labor government. At the time that the Brown Liberal government took over office in South Australia our state debt was accelerating towards $9 billion. This debt is now being cut back, but the ultimate effect of Labor's economic mismanagement has been a level of poverty that we need not have had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, poverty is a national problem. A study released earlier this year by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra estimated that 1.8 million Australians are living in poverty. Of this number, nearly 1.2 million were members of families with children&mdash;a chilling reminder of the failure of Labor to honour its 1987 election promise that `by 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty'. Australian society has been torn apart by the growth of poverty, as the gap between the rich and the poor grows wider. The sense of community, which has previously bound us together as a nation, must necessarily weaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recently released study by Professor Bob Gregory investigated the polarisation of wealth and poverty in Australia. The findings of this study are alarming. Twenty years ago the average income of people in the bottom five per cent of Australian neighbourhoods was 60 per cent of that of people in the top five per cent of neighbourhoods. By 1991, those at the bottom were earning less than 40 per cent of the income earned by Australia's wealthy. Over the same period average household income in the top five per cent of neighbourhoods rose by 23 per cent. In stark contrast, those in the poorer five per cent of neighbourhoods found themselves surviving on an average household income that fell by 23 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gregory found that employment levels between the neighbourhoods were also polarising. From the mid-1970s to 1991 the number of employed men as a proportion of the population dropped by 42 per cent in the bottom five per cent of neighbourhoods. This compares to a drop of 20 per cent in wealthier areas. This polarisation has been reinforced by trends in employment levels for women. In the 15 years prior to 1991, the level of employment among women living in the top half of Australian neighbourhoods increased by about 10 per cent. Over the same period it fell by a dramatic 40 per cent for women living in poorer areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Income inequity and poverty in Australia is entrenched and increasing. Surely there is no greater proof of the failure of economic management over the last 13 years than this. I would suggest that a good starting point from which to begin the task of reversing the trend towards income inequity would be for the government to at least recognise the very real hardship that many Australians are experiencing during the Prime Minister's `golden age'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At about the time the Prime Minister was assuring Australians that `this is as good as it gets', over 70 per cent of the people in my electorate who returned a questionnaire I had sent to their homes said they were less financially secure than they had been three years ago. The community organisations providing emergency relief in my electorate have confirmed the implications of my survey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During discussions with me, Anglican Community Services pointed out that the demand for welfare in both the northern and southern suburbs of metropolitan Adelaide continues to increase. This is in spite of what the Prime Minister has described as `the best conjunction of economic fundamentals in 30 years'. Perhaps the clearest indication of the government's failure to grasp the dimensions and nature of poverty and income inequality in Australia is its decision to cut funding to non-government providers of welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last budget the Keating government cut emergency relief funding by $5 million to $14 million. A letter I have recently received from Lutheran Community Care based at Blair Athol in my electorate is indicative of the impact this funding cut will have on the provision of health to those in need. It states:</PARA>

<PARA>Statistics provided in this letter show that Lutheran Community Care saw 1,098 clients in 1993-94 and 1,037 clients in 1994-95. The crucial point to be recognised is that there was no decrease in demand for the services provided by this agency over the past two financial years. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth government has seen fit to cut funding to this agency by a massive 24 per cent. The rationale for this funding cut is that the unemployment rate has fallen. Such a rationale betrays a frightening lack of understanding about the entrenchment of poverty in Australia. Poverty is no longer confined to the unemployed, and this is the reason the demand for services provided by Lutheran Community Care has not decreased in line with falls in the level of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been pointed out in discussions with Lutheran Community Care, only one-third of those assisted are unemployed.

<PARA>While the causes of poverty are complex, the failure of the Keating government to sustain economic recovery has been a major contributing factor. As I have said on previous occasions in this place, the very essence of the recoveries the Prime Minister oversees is their shallowness. They are fleeting recoveries in which fewer and fewer Australians get back on their feet before the bust. They are recoveries in which the economic sun shines briefly and each time it does it  does so for an increasingly select few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relentless cycle of boom and bust that Australia has experienced over the last 13 years is dividing us into a society of haves and have nots.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion before us gives this House an opportunity to discuss an important issue. Whilst I am not so naive as to not expect that the discussion that has preceded me would have as its basis political partisan views on the present situation, I hope that we can continue this discussion in a manner that will have a lasting benefit apart from political point scoring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties that we confront when discussing poverty is that we have to try to come to grips with the ways in which it can be diagnosed. The report that was produced by the Queensland Council of Social Service, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drawing the line on poverty</EMPHASIS>, used as its basis the Henderson poverty line. The Henderson poverty line has been a valuable tool to try to measure the extent of poverty throughout Australia for quite some time. But even at the time that Professor Henderson first put this measure in place, it was only a view of the extent of poverty. But it is important because it gives us, in a temporal sense, the longest series of figures to compare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had hoped that throughout the previous years of Labor governments we would come to grips with looking at measures that perhaps more readily reflected the extent of poverty throughout the community, but that has not been the case. So I, in a gentle way, criticise that perhaps we have not made that a priority. Of course, that is not the central issue that the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) goes to in moving this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if we do not use the Henderson poverty line as a measure, if we use anecdotal evidence such as has been discussed this morning&mdash;the use of emergency relief&mdash;we can readily acknowledge that there are those who use charitable institutions to get meals and to have emergency accommodation and that that is a reflection that poverty is a problem in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I readily acknowledge that from time to time comments that I make can be interpreted that I am anxious for the government to do more. But, fairly, I acknowledge that over the periods of Labor government in the federal sphere a raft of measures have been put in place which have directly attacked the alleviation of poverty, have tried to address the disparity between the rich and poor and have tried to address the disparity between the disadvantaged and the advantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To use only income levels as the measure for assessing our achievements in those goals is to not recognise that there are other important things that impinge on people's quality of life and on people's ability to tackle their hopes and aspirations. We should not leave today's discussion without acknowledging that it is not only economic measures that are important to the way in which individuals and families are able to operate within the community. We have to acknowledge that economic policy, policy surrounding matters of social justice and even policy surrounding matters of the environment must be taken together in looking at people's so-called quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many studies carried out over recent times have tried to better equip us to look at the issues that come under the banner of this motion. The honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) mentioned some of the studies by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, whose director is Professor Anne Harding. Professor Harding has, over many years, championed the thought that we should be looking at those matters that fall under the nomenclature of the social wage and adding those to any studies that are simply based on income levels. Her studies have shown that, if we take into account those measures that can be called social wage measures, the disparity between the rich and the poor has narrowed and that those social wage measures to a large extent are able to lift the disadvantaged above what might be defined as the poverty level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The various social wage measures include such things as social security benefits and child-care, health and education assistance for the disadvantaged. The honourable member for Hinkler's motion calls upon all Australian governments&mdash;I take that to mean not only the federal government but all the state governments and, indeed, local government authorities who can impact upon family and individual incomes through social wage measures&mdash;to address this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Council of Social Service report went to a number of measures that it thought were required to build an agenda for action on poverty. The report went to such diverse measures as concessions for public transport, which of course is in the hands of state government; public housing&mdash;which I acknowledge the council emphasised&mdash;and local area planning schemes. Local government authorities are called upon to play a role in ensuring that the newer developing suburbs and communities take into account the needs of affordable housing. In my area, through funding under the building better cities program, we are using former institutional land at Janefield to try to develop an urban planning scheme that will acknowledge the needs of the different life-cycle points of the community and the need for affordable housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another telling part of the agenda that QCOSS called for was improvement to the education system. We have to acknowledge that these matters are important. In the state of Victoria, unfortunately, the downside of the measures that the Kennett government has undertaken under the banner of increasing economic efficiency is that they take away elements of the social wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, QCOSS was asking for such things as specialist support staff and outreach programs to link schools and communities. They are the very programs which in Victoria are being diminished. QCOSS called for pre-service and in-service training courses to be developed to better equip teachers. In Victoria, these are the things that are being removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not introduce that simply to have a go at the Victorian government. My concern is the different philosophies. On the one hand, we have the Victorian government hell-bent on economic rationalism to create economic efficiencies without looking at the social cost of the things they are doing. If we look at international examples, whenever governments put in place economic rather than interventionist policies, that has been the result. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It grieves me to hear the member for Capricornia (Mrs Henzell) trot out the statistic that two million jobs have been created in a certain period of time. I ask the government: what is the nature of a statistic like that when somebody has been put off, when they are homeless, when they are desperate, when they lack education facilities, when they lack the jobs that those two million have? There should be a lot more honesty from the government, if it is going to present those sorts of statistics, about what those two million jobs are. As we know, that figure relates mainly to casual workers with as little as two hours work per week. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is the second part of the motion that I think is important. It calls on all Australian governments to:</PARA>

<PARA>I want to talk about the country. There is a lack of appreciation here about the country. I read in the paper and hear that for 30 days Sydney has not had rain. Areas of my electorate have been three years without a drop of rain&mdash;three years in which people have not been able to pasture their cattle. People have had to destock, and face huge interest rates. Yet the Queensland government's attitude is that, in spite of all this, there should be a user-pays basis for the value of the lease, increasing the cost of the lease&mdash;and there are also instructions that other conditions of the lease have to be fulfilled even though the country is in this condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three years without rain, five years in a drought situation! The gap between the country and the city is growing day by day. There has to be a greater appreciation of what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just a lack of wealth that is creating this new poor, who are not only primary producers but also local government workers, businesses, services&mdash;the people who make up a town.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Okay, the Goss government has just had a bit of a touch-up by the electorate. They acknowledge that. But the report we are talking about here is something of a dated report. It refers back to a survey in 1989-90. The Goss government only came into office in 1989, so it is a bit unfair to blame them when we had 32 years of National Party neglect of everything in Queensland&mdash;not just people at the bottom end of the scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need only look at dealings with Aboriginal people in Queensland. That 32 years shows a lot of neglect for those people particularly. They live in the worst poverty of all. That is known throughout the length and breadth of Australia. For National Party members to get up in this place and try to blame the Goss government for National Party neglect over 32 years is quite atrocious. It is atrocious to even suggest it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This federal Labor government has been in office since 1983. Our biggest task is to address employment. The best way to assist people who are living in poverty is to get them into a job. That is one of the things we have been trying to achieve. The Working Nation statement has been one of the great success stories of this nation. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has to be congratulated on his efforts in implementing that program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one year down the track now since Working Nation was announced, and all the things in it are starting to flow through very positively throughout our community. I know that in my own electorate of Oxley real things are happening, particularly in relation to the long-term unemployed, who are really getting into employment now. They are the people who need the greatest assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are still areas that need a lot of work, and we are working through those. There are areas in my electorate, in the Riverview and Goodna areas, for instance, that need a lot more assistance, and that is something that has been highlighted recently. It is something I am very concerned about and I am working very closely with the local community to ensure that benefits flow on to those people, for example, with emergency assistance, and particularly in getting jobs for those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community traditionally has had a major problem with housing. Of course, the National Party government in Queensland for many years put all our Housing Commission homes in the one block and brought people with the same socioeconomic problems together. All that does is increase the problem, and that went on for many, many years under the National Party government. You cannot expect someone to fix that overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was just looking at some reports about housing. The public housing stock in Queensland is the smallest of all states and that reflects the 32 years of neglect of the National Party. It needs to be highlighted. Only 3.6 per cent of householders are actually in public housing. The report notes that public housing is crucial in reducing poverty, and that is absolutely right. But since 1988 the number of public dwellings in Queensland has increased by more than 60 per cent. That is a record the Goss government clearly missed out on in the recent election, because a lot of things are happening in a very positive way. More needs to be done. We need do that from the federal level and work in cooperation with the state governments. I note that that cooperation is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National Party members are really very hypocritical. They had 32 years in Queensland before the Goss government came to office. It is quite outrageous for them to attack a report like this, which is a dated report anyway. They should hang their heads in shame for their many, many years of neglect in Queensland.

<PARA>Almost all members of parliament would be familiar with the draft report into the Australian wine industry. Almost all of them would have seen this report and most will be familiar with its contents, much of which is the result of a report by the committee of inquiry into the wine grape and wine industry that followed the 1993 budget statement of this government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What many members are unaware of, however, is that the final report is currently on the desk of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins). The Australian wine industry is waiting for Minister Collins to make a decision on the recommendations of the final report. Those recommendations are unknown to the industry and are unknown to all members of this House, apart, of course, from Minister Collins. The particular concern that I have and the particular concern that the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) has is that the recommendations of the draft report should not be implemented; nor, we hope, are they part of the recommendations currently being considered by Senator Collins in the currently private final report. </PARA>

This is an industry on target to perform and an industry currently under threat of being taxed out of existence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be some who will say, `If the industry is performing this well, shouldn't it carry an additional tax burden?' Let me indicate to you just how cost sensitive this industry is and just how desperate its participants are to perform in a national sense. Historically, grapes would always have been planted in rectangular blocks, irrigated either by a drip irrigation system where water was scarce or by a flood irrigation system where in the past water was more plentiful. In 1995, that sort of extension is largely becoming historic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke only a month ago to the principal vineyard manager for Orlando Wines, one of Australia's largest producers, and he indicated that the current expansion they are involved in is computer irrigation. More than that, all of their plantings currently occurring in South Australia occur only after a soil profile has been done. They determine which are the heavier soils and which are the lighter soils. Where the heavier soils exist a dripper with a different rate of water application will be applied relative to those vines of a different variety being planted in a lighter soil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entire area has computerised irrigation, ensuring that each vine has delivered to it only the water it needs. As if that were not enough, premium varieties are being planted in the soils that most suit them and they are planted on trellises that allow them to be mechanically harvested and mechanically pruned so that Australia's wine industry can continue to take on the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of this expansion, the Australian wine industry only makes up 2.2 per cent of the world trade in exported wine. If we want to continue to increase that proportion, we have to be efficient, which is just what they are endeavouring to be, and we have to maintain our reputation for quality and our image that the nation has for being a producer of clean and green product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government needs to be aware of those things that are unique about the Australian wine industry. One of the things that separates the wine industry from other industries is that it has a long lead time and a large investment per hectare. All members in the House will be familiar with the fact that anyone who is committing themselves to the future of the Australian wine industry is committing themselves to an industry in which they will have invested a great deal of money before they get any real return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an industry which only 10 years ago faced a vine pull because its export future and its market future was unknown. It has effectively pulled itself up by its own bootstraps. It is also an industry which only 12 years ago carried no sales tax at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one will remember more clearly than the member for Riverina the commitment of former Prime Minister Hawke, who in the member for Riverina's electorate said, `Not only does this industry have no sales tax, but under this government it will not have a sales tax.' What has happened? The sales tax on the wine industry, which was at zero and was maintained at zero thanks to the effective work of the Fraser government and of my predecessor, the late Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles, under this government went to 10 per cent despite that promise. As if that was not enough, it then went to 20 per cent. And, as if that was not enough, under the 1993 budget statement it was proposed that it go to 32 per cent. That is where it would be if it were not for this committee of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee of inquiry's draft report has itself recommended a further tax increase and, worse than that, a volumetric tax. We are opposed not to the wine industry being taxed&mdash;the coalition has had a consistent voting pattern: we supported the initial tax, recognising that you cannot have an alcoholic beverage without expecting it to carry some tax, and resisted subsequent tax rises, which were nothing more than a hungry grab from a desperate government&mdash;but to a volumetric tax, because that is the tax that most unfairly impinges on the large proportion of the wine industry located in electorates such as mine in the Riverland area, such as that of the member for Mallee in the Sunraysia area and such as that of the member for Riverina in the Murrumbidgee irrigation area. Frankly, a volumetric tax ruins this industry because it undercuts the domestic market on which the export industry is based and flows on and adversely affects the dried fruit industry as well. </PARA>

Victoria is indeed the home of great wine production, particularly table wine. There are substantial increased plantings occurring right throughout Victoria. Indeed, Tyrrells Vineyards from New South Wales has recently bought land around the Heathcote area, which the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) would be quite familiar with. Tyrrells are establishing a major new vineyard area around Heathcote. The industry in Victoria is one of great growth and of great economic importance to the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a view that a country's industry policy should firstly reflect the strengths of that country's production. Australia's industry policy should firstly look at and examine the strengths of production in this country. Agriculture across the board is one of the great strengths of Australian production. We provide clean, pollution-free food. It can be value added and it can be exported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, one of the great tragedies in industry growth has been the lack of interest in the Australian investment market of the food processing companies previously owned by Pacific Dunlop. This country wants to have a really good think about itself when its major institutional investors have failed to support Philip Brass and Pacific Dunlop in their rather bold venture to bring value adding of food under the one roof. The fact that the Australian institutional investors did not support Pacific Dunlop meant that those companies were sold overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I find that to be alarming, and I am very critical of Australian institutional investors for allowing it to happen. It is a great pity that the vision of Philip Brass and Pacific Dunlop was not borne out by market conditions here. The fact that those assets were sold for some $1.8 billion over and above that at which the market had valued them in Australia indicates that Philip Brass was right in his assessment of those industries and their worth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry is part of value adding to agriculture. It is a major growth industry. It is an industry which has enormous potential in export income. It takes the raw commodity, the grape, to a juice, to the bottling of a highly sophisticated product that we call wine. However, it is but one of the many fine food products that Australian agriculture can make. I have been and will continue to be a critic of the present method of taxation of wine in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing I am critical of is the fact that wine is treated as manufactured trading stock. That is, our taxation regime requires that wine, in its year of manufacture, be brought to account as income in the year of production. For an industry which can value add by ageing wine, it has never made sense to me that we say to a wine producer, `You have to pay tax on the imputed value of your wine production in the year of production.' It has never made sense to me that a country which is looking for exports and which has such magnificent value added potential with wine prohibits the ageing of wine with the use of the taxation regime by calling wine trading stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wine is not manufactured in the sense of pencils, pens or other materials; it is an agricultural product which will be of great value if it can be left to age. Because of that tax regime I have mentioned, Australian wine manufacturers have developed techniques which allow them to bring wine into production and sale much more quickly than with earlier methods where it was traditional to lay it down in a cellar to get that magnificent ageing process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Australian wine manufacturers do not now put their good wines through a major ageing process because it is simply not cost effective and they are taxed out of the ability to do so, yet that is an area which I think any industry policy should examine and do things about. That would make the industry more attractive and more profitable and allow the industry to produce ageing wines which have a greater market value overseas. That is one area I have always been critical of, and I still hope one day to see some change in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about an industry with a potential export growth increase of some $1.3 billion. We are talking about an industry where we can achieve approximately a five per cent share of the world's wine market by the year 2010. We are talking about an industry which is now seen throughout the world as a manufacturer of a very fine product. You can now travel to countries such as England and Europe and find Australian wines competing against the very best wines produced anywhere in the world&mdash;and it competes at a price. So it is a very competitive industry in a very competitive marketplace. It is essential that that competitive nature of the industry be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a politician, I have been a student of the wine industry for a number of years. I am familiar with a number of reports which have been brought down&mdash;a Victorian parliamentary report and a federal parliamentary report, which both touched on the lack of elasticity in the price of wine in the marketplace. In fact, it is quite clear that, economically, wine has a very low elasticity in price. In other words, if you increase the price of wine at the retail level, your sales will drop off. That lack of elasticity in the price of wine has been referred to in many reports and on many occasions. Of course, any tax adds to the price of the wine at the retail level. Obviously, with wine being so competitive, the margins are very fine and producers cannot afford to carry any increased taxes and have to pass them on to the consumer. That lack of elasticity immediately impacts on the sales of wines&mdash;and their sales drop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to be successful in overseas markets, then we have to encourage domestic production. The producer who is going to put some $10,000 per hectare in the planting of young vines has to carry those vines for up to five years before he is going to get any production growth out of it and any income return back. If our producers are going to become exporters, first of all, we have to ensure and encourage their domestic production and have a very healthy domestic market for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people I know in the industry have started off as domestic producers and have now gone into exports. For example, the Delatite vineyard near Mansfield is one of the real cold climate producers in Australia whose rieslings and chardonnays are now widely sought after in London. It now has a major English exporting business out of the Delatite area at the base of Mount Buller. That is an unusual place to grow wine&mdash;believe me, in winter it is very cold&mdash;yet it produces some brilliant cold climate wines. There is a whole host of vineyards in my electorate that are similar. Mount St Helens, for example, in the Strathbogie Ranges is now a very large producer of cold climate chardonnay. Mount St Helens is a brand which is produced in Echuca, but the grapes are actually grown in the Strathbogie Ranges in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to encourage these people. Any increase in taxes is not the sort of encouragement we should be giving them. It is no secret I have opposed any increase in ad valorem taxes. I think the current tax of 26 per cent ad valorem is more than enough for the industry to carry. I was quite shocked and horrified when I read the report of the Industry Commission on the industry. A tax based on volume, quite frankly, is an absolute nonsense. I am sometimes astonished when people say they understand industry and are in a position of publicly involving themselves in industry direction and then come up with such quaint and nonsense arguments. Anyone who knows anything about the industry would know that it cannot carry a volume tax on wine. It really cannot carry any increase on wine. </PARA>

The taxation disadvantages suffered by the wine makers with respect to stockholding will be objectively examined on the basis that wine making is a primary production process, not a manufacturing industry.' The reason the then Prime Minister was making this promise was that he knew how important the wine making industry was to the Riverina and to the wine making areas of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that these promises have been broken. Since then the wine making industry has faced a very hostile tax regime&mdash;the latest being the decision taken in the August 1993 budget to increase the sales tax on wine from 20 to 31 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So did the opposition&mdash;including the member for Wakefield, who played a major role. Industry held the government to a 22 per cent tax for the 1993-94 season. The government then progressively raised it to 26 per cent by July 1996, and the matter was referred to the Industry Commission. The commission has now met, and that is what this motion is about today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major problem with the wine industry is the uncertainty it faces. The government, as in many instances where it is involved, seems to keep changing the rules of the game. This government is a big spending government with a voracious appetite for tax. It has to get tax wherever it can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the tax regimes and the impositions, the industry has managed to get on with the job and show what can be done by an industry that is keen, has the technology and is prepared to work. This commission has released a draft report, which shows that conflicting views are held among the three panel members of the committee of inquiry on the matter of an appropriate taxation regime for the wine industry. The worst cases were put by the chairman, Mr Scales, whose recommendations are that there be a 32 per cent wholesale sales tax and an additional tax, in common with the rest of the panel members&mdash;a specific tax of $4 per litre of alcohol. The combined effect of these two taxes, as proposed by Mr Scales, is equivalent to doubling the current sales tax on wine. We know that neither of these recommendations is acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why a government which needs taxes, because it is a big spender, has a huge foreign debt and is supposedly keen to assist industry in creating jobs, would carry out these recommendations. The sooner the government comes out and says, `We're not going to take any notice of these recommendations, but we'll accept the recommendations of the wine industry,' the better off the industry and the government will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to raise the issue of the effect that it will have on the wine electorates. My electorate is presently exporting the technology of the wine making industry in Australia to places such as France. The Ron Potter rotary fermenter is a good case in point. We are building wineries in France, California, Chile, Cyprus, China and Vietnam using Australian state-of-the-art technology. This is employing people in the manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, research and development is going on in Australia. At Charles Sturt University at Wagga Wagga, for example, there are more people this year doing a tertiary education course in wine making than there has ever been before. Most importantly, by the year 2000 we will be employing another 7,000 people in vineyards throughout Australia and another 7,000 in the wineries. If that is not enough for the government, I do not know what the wine industry has to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be taking note of the wine industry. Let us have a look at exports. I will quickly list some wineries in the Riverina area. McWilliams is exporting 30,000 to 60,000 cases of wine to Japan during the first year of its 10-year contract.

In August 1993 the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) toured the Swan Valley with me. A consequence of that tour was that the Swan Valley Tourism Council was the recipient of a regional and tourism promotion grant in May 1994. That culminated in April of this year with the launch of a new Swan Valley tourism logo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September 1993 the regional development task force visited the Swan Valley to gain an appreciation of the strength of the industries in the Swan Valley and the Midland region. In October 1994 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration, in the course of its reference on tourism and taxation, visited the Swan Valley to gain an appreciation first-hand of some of the difficulties which wine producers in the valley were finding. I refer to the House of Representatives banking committee report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxing relaxing</EMPHASIS> of March 1995. At page 33 of that report, under the heading `Cellar Door Wine Samples', the committee reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.22<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales tax is levied on products used for promotional purposes, including samples that are given away. This affects wine makers who use some of their product for tasting purposes and is particularly onerous for operators of small wineries who rely on cellar door sales. For these operators, sales tax constitutes double taxation as the cost of samples, including their tax component, is built into the price of goods that are sold.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.23<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee notes two dimensions to this issue. A special exemption for cellar door wineries could be administratively complicated because of differences in the way cellar door tastings are conducted, for example, some wineries charge a tasting fee and others include tastings as part of a food and beverage package.(78) In addition, an exemption would be inequitable unless it applied to all samples given away for promotional purposes. The Committee concludes that the issue of sales tax on product `give aways' requires a fuller investigation and notes that, in respect of the wine industry, this issue is currently the subject of an inquiry chaired by the Chairman of the Industry Commission which will report by 30 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, with great respect to the draft report of the wine industry, that issue has not been taken up. It is my view that the draft report is disappointing. It fails, in my view, to understand the nature of the wine industry. A two-tier taxation system in the wine industry, which is what has been suggested, would in my view be nothing short of a disaster. I think the appropriate response to this committee's draft recommendations is not only to leave best alone and not disturb the current tax arrangements but also to do something for the small producers like those in my electorate and the Swan Valley and to take up the cudgels of the banking committee and produce some exemptions from sales tax for tastings and give-aways by small producers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Few people in this parliament know the wine industry as well as the members who have taken part in this debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely I do not have to outline the losses sustained by the industry as a result of crippling drought.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many members know that wine donated to charity is taxed, and that wine used for tasting purposes is taxed? I would estimate that thousands of litres of wine per year are donated by Hunter vignerons to various charities throughout the Hunter Valley.

The vignerons give away so much wine for which they receive absolutely no return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An increased tax on wine is really a punishment imposed on entrepreneurial success.

Increased wine taxes certainly will kill off investment in an industry which, as other speakers have said, has the potential to earn huge export dollars and assist our trading problems. Kill the wine industry and what happens? First of all, we kill off employment.

But it is worth noting that the bombing came at a time when there was much public criticism of our security forces, including serious questioning of the need for their existence. The Dunstan government in South Australia had abolished the South Australian Police special branch following the White inquiry, and other states were considering following suit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC's documentary <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Conspiracy</EMPHASIS>, screened on 19 February 1995, revealed that in the National Library files there are 10 times more press clippings relating to security matters for the month of January 1978 than for an average month's coverage in the last 30 years. The public criticism and questioning apparently caused concern amongst security forces and amongst some conservative governments who were said to be keen to maintain links between ASIO and special branches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Hilton bombing and the accompanying concern about international terrorism, ASIO received a 25 per cent increase in funding in the 1978 federal budget. That was when the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer. It was his first budget&mdash;the same budget in which he took back the fistful of dollars promised at the 1977 election. ASIO was also granted substantially increased powers in the ASIO Act, passed in 1979. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1978 three members of the Ananda Marga sect&mdash;Timothy Anderson, Paul Alister and Ross Dunn&mdash;were arrested and charged with attempting to murder a right-wing extremist, Robert Cameron, with a bomb, which was alleged to be similar to the bomb used in the Hilton bombing. With the help of evidence from Richard Seary, who had infiltrated the Margas at the request of the New South Wales Police special branch, the three men were convicted and spent seven years in gaol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1982, 4 1/2 years after the Hilton bombing, a coronial inquest commenced. This inquest turned out to be a farce and proved totally inadequate. Far from solving the crime, it  failed to examine important evidence. Key witnesses were prevented from appearing, and crucial evidence was therefore suppressed. However, Richard Seary was again allowed to give evidence, which claimed that Dunn, Alister and Anderson had been responsible for the Hilton bombing. This led to a prima facie case being found against them, and the inquest was therefore terminated, amid uproar in the courtroom. However, no charges were laid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985, the Wood inquiry found that a doubt remained as to the three men's guilt over the attempted murder of Cameron. They were released from prison and received a pardon. In 1980, the then Attorney-General of New South Wales, Frank Walker&mdash;now the honourable member for Robertson and the federal Minister for Administrative Services&mdash;had interviewed a Commonwealth scientist who claimed that he had been requested by ASIO to make two bombs, shortly before the Hilton bombing in February 1978. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scientist, whose identity has never been made public, had been referred to Mr Walker by the then federal shadow Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans. In 1981, Mr Peter Monaghan, an adviser to the then Australian Democrats Senator Colin Mason, told Mr Terry Griffiths, a victim of the bombing, that he had received a visit from two men claiming to be from ASIO. The men told Mr Monaghan that ASIO had been involved in the Hilton bombing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been much said on the public record over many years regarding this affair. Time does not permit me to cover it all, but the fact remains that not only does the murder of three people remain unresolved but evidence continues to mount which has created real concern in the community. This concern is not just going to go away. This parliament cannot continue to ignore this issue. That is why I have moved this motion in the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1991, the New South Wales parliament unanimously passed a motion calling for a joint federal-New South Wales government inquiry and pledged the cooperation of the New South Wales government. I am now calling on this House to support my motion which is in similar terms. The new New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, has confirmed his support for such an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He does have the option of conducting a New South Wales inquiry, but this would clearly be of limited value as it is vital that all relevant federal agencies and subagencies participate fully and that witnesses under Commonwealth jurisdiction are able to be called to give evidence under oath and without any restrictions placed on them by secrecy provisions of any federal legislation, as outlined in part (5) of my motion. This is essential in order to get to the bottom of the matter, uncover the truth and force these agencies to be accountable for their activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has stated that the Commonwealth would fully cooperate in any inquiry established by the New South Wales government provided sensitive material is protected. However, for the reasons I have outlined, I do not believe this goes far enough. We need a full, open, joint federal-New South Wales inquiry with the powers of a royal commission. As for the reference to sensitive material, I believe it is unacceptable for security forces to hide behind so-called secrecy and avoid accountability in matters as serious as this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General also said that the federal Labor government would have no reason to be embarrassed by any revelations regarding the involvement of Commonwealth agencies in the bombing because the government of the day was, of course, the Fraser Liberal government. I can only agree with that. Indeed, one of the matters which could be examined is the role of Mr Fraser and his office in the security arrangements, as well as the Fraser government's attitude towards the abolition of special branches in the states, and the role of ASIO and other security services in the light of the South Australian White inquiry. I am advised that Mr Fraser himself took over responsibility for security at the Hilton Hotel shortly before the bomb blast on 13 February 1978. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I do not want to make this a partisan political issue. It is fair to point out that the resolution of the New South Wales parliament in 1991&mdash;under a state Liberal government&mdash;was unanimous, and that people such as Peter Collins, the then New South Wales Attorney-General and current opposition leader, have repeatedly, to their credit, supported the need for a joint inquiry. But there are many other questions the inquiry could investigate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is short, but the questions include: why were the army sniffer dogs, which were specially trained and prepared for the CHOGRM conference at the Hilton, mysteriously called off four days before the bombing? Despite official denials, this has been confirmed by ex Corporal Keith Burley, who was in charge of the army sniffer dog squad at the time. I have a copy of his letter to former New South Wales MP John Hatton dated 4 November 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why was the rubbish bin outside the Hilton the only one in Sydney not emptied by council workers on the weekend before the bombing? Police had prevented council workers from emptying the bin on three occasions prior to the explosion. Why was no explosive residue found at the scene? Did ASIO request a Commonwealth scientist to make two bombs in 1978 in the weeks leading up to the bombing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the last point, there are also questions arising from the report of the now retired Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Mr Roger Holdich, which was tabled in this House on 28 June 1995. The report states on page 51 that Senator Gareth Evans provided Mr Holdich with the name of the Commonwealth scientist who approached him in 1980. Mr Holdich states that he found no evidence of ASIO involvement in the making of bombs in 1978 but the report fails to state whether or not Mr Holdich interviewed the scientist in question. Did Mr Holdich interview the scientist? If so, what was the result; if not, why not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been alleged that Mr Holdich himself worked for a security organisation at the time of the bombing. I do not know if that is true, but if it were true a cynical observer might question the credibility of his report, which clears ASIO of any improper conduct or any involvement in the Hilton bombing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this demonstrates that there is an urgent need in the public interest for a top level inquiry to bring out the facts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are those who would say that the law has spoken, therefore there is nothing left to be investigated, but it is not as simple as that. First of all, we have the evidence of Corporal Keith Burley, who was in charge of the army sniffer dog squad. In a letter some years ago he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Approximately two weeks prior to the Hilton bombing the operational team was placed on standby for the CHOGM Conference. We were told specifically to train the dogs on such things as letter bombs and parcel bombs. This we did by making up these articles using live explosives. We trained specifically for this task for almost two weeks. On the Thursday before the Hilton bombing we received information at the kennels saying that we were no longer required. This we thought was very unusual to say the least. We attempted to find out why but were unable to determine where the `cancellation' came from. All I know is that it came through Victoria Barracks in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a lot of rumour and innuendo going around at the time we were at the scene. The strongest being that ASIO had stuffed up. It was common comment around at the time that ASIO had in fact planted the device and planned to find it for whatever purpose, but the garbage men were early that morning.</PARA>
<PARA>Then we had the statements of Frank Walker, now Minister for Administrative Services, who was visited by a scientist who claimed to have been involved in making bombs for ASIO. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"He was a fairly impressive guy," Walker, now a Federal Labor MP, said this week. "He was disaffected with the CSIRO but he seemed to be a responsible person."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scientist said that CSIRO, on at least several occasions, had made bombs for ASIO. In the weeks leading up to February 13, 1978&mdash;when a bomb killed two garbage collectors and a policeman outside the Sydney Hilton, venue for a meeting of Commonwealth leaders&mdash;there had been an "order" for at least two bombs. ASIO wanted them in a hurry: Walker recalls the scientist saying that the organisation came under a great deal of pressure to produce them.</PARA>
<PARA>What happened was that Frank Walker, then a minister in the New South Wales government, ordered an investigation by New South Wales government officials. He affirms positively and indubitably that he saw a written report arising out of that investigation. Let me congratulate the Minister for Administrative Services. I wish he had shown the same passion for the truth in the Botany council case, but an incomplete passion for the truth is better than none at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security now says that no investigation ever took place and no records or reports even exist. So either the Minister for Administrative Services is lying or the files have been tampered with. I do not believe that the Minister for Administrative Services is a liar, but that in effect is what was said in the Holdich report, the report which the current Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) is doing his best to defend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General wrote last month to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, claiming that an earlier answer to a question on notice comprehensively disproved the sniffer dog theory. Let us look at the answer the Attorney-General referred to. The answer provided by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and given by the member for Kingston (Mr Bilney) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Officer Commanding the Military Dog Wing probably ordered his soldiers to undertake some training relating to&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">may have been given an order to stand down . . . The commanding Officer of the School cannot recall giving such a direction. However, he does not rule out the possibility. It is not known if any explanation was given.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, these are weasel words. The truth, which is quite clear even on the basis of the minister's old answer, is that the army sniffer dog squad was asked to prepare and they were told to stop. The only explanation given by the minister was that the police did not follow up their initial request for army help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dog squad was told to prepare for a terrorist attack. It was not confirmed in quadruplicate from the official sources so they assumed, we are asked to believe, that the terrorist attack was no longer a possibility. This just beggars belief. If the Attorney-General believes that this constitutes comprehensive disproof, he would believe anything. He would probably believe that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) tells the truth! In a letter to one of the victims of the Hilton bomb, the Attorney-General magnanimously said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that Commonwealth agencies would co-operate fully with any inquiry which the Government of New South Wales established, subject, of course, to agreement on suitable arrangements to protect any sensitive material to which such an inquiry might be given access. I confirm that position.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Attorney-General is saying that you can inquire into anything you like except the truth, and you can have any information you need except information that might incriminate the Commonwealth government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Attorney-General: what kind of Sir Humphrey Applebys are there in his department that he is prepared to operate on this basis? The Minister for Administrative Services is concerned. He believes there should be an inquiry. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and former Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, has placed on record his concerns about these matters. Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, has said that he is concerned about these matters, and the whole of the New South Wales parliament has passed a resolution calling for a full and independent Commonwealth-state investigation into these matters. They all think there is something wrong. Why doesn't the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our job is not, here in this parliament, to specifically probe into the dark and murky labyrinth of the security forces. Our job is to ensure that people who can do that job are allowed to do that job. Our job is to help establish an inquiry which can get to the bottom of this matter. It is so important that we do this because the people of this country are entitled to believe and to be confident that the forces of government, the security forces of this country, are working for them and not against them.

This government should not be so concerned about the cost of an inquiry because truth is priceless; truth is precious.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that this morning, with the motion of the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland), we might have heard something new that this government has not already considered. I come with some background of having looked at this matter extremely carefully and I must say that the recent decision by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) not to support a royal commission is something which, on all the evidence available to me, I support unequivocally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are a few questions that should be answered this morning, and I want to go through them in a bit of detail. The first question is: why do people want an inquiry into the Hilton bombing? We heard one new one this morning, and that was from the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) who said that it was common knowledge that ASIO planted the bomb. That is his view. Other people want an inquiry because they think, similar to the view expressed by the honourable member for Warringah, that it was ASIO which conspired to plant the bomb, for reasons which were then dealt with earlier by the honourable member for Macarthur, because he pointed out, as other people have, that at the time the whole question of security agencies and the need for them was very much an issue in the public domain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question is that this government is resisting an inquiry because it wants to cover up embarrassing facts. I want to clear up that allegation of embarrassment first, which was dealt with to some extent by the honourable member for Macarthur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the people in this House and those who have taken some interest in this matter&mdash;the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) is listed to speak; he took some interest, not necessarily on his own behalf, but as a result of views put by other people to him&mdash;to just consider a few things. What conceivable reason would this government have? Why would I, as Attorney-General, the present Attorney-General or anybody else in this government be wanting to cover up something relating to the Hilton bombing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reflect back to what happened. The actions that would be investigated by various inquiries, royal commissions or whatever would relate to the Fraser Liberal government, ASIO and the then Commonwealth police 20 years ago. To suggest that somehow or other their actions cause some embarrassment to the present Attorney-General, to me or to anyone else is ludicrous in the extreme. I have always taken the view that it would be no skin off my nose, or the nose of the present Attorney-General, if there were any convincing reasons to justify having a royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting thing which I would like people to reflect on for a moment is what it would achieve. When you start with the view that ASIO was involved, because it was common knowledge, as was put by the previous speaker, is anyone going to believe what comes out of a royal commission? I know what would happen if there were a royal commission, whether it were run by New South Wales or whatever. People would not believe it, because people like the conspiracy theory: they wallow in it and they will go on believing it forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth recalling that the activities of ASIO in relation to those events of February 1978 have, in one way or another, been subject to five different inquiries already&mdash;not to the wide extent that the speakers here this morning want, I concede. The first one was the New South Wales coronial inquest in 1982. The second one was the Hope Royal Commission into Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies in 1984. The third one was the Woods inquiry into the conviction of the so-called `Yagoona Three' in 1984-85. The fourth one, the most recent inquiry to touch on ASIO's activities around the time of the bombing, was the report by the previous Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security into certain complaints against ASIO by Mr Richard Seary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General tabled that report in this parliament on 29 June. I doubt very much whether any of the speakers in this debate have read the report of the previous Inspector-General very carefully. They may be able to refute that, but I have grave doubts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that inquiry, the Inspector-General examined ASIO's intelligence holdings relating to the Hilton bombing to the extent that they were relevant to Mr Seary's complaints. If he had found evidence of complicity by ASIO in the Hilton bombing he would surely have said so in his report, but he did not. On the contrary, he said, `ASIO received no clear warning that the Hilton bombing was going to occur,' and, `From what I have read and heard, the organisation was genuinely shocked at the bombing.' That appears at pages 27 and 58 of the report tabled by the Attorney-General in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this government's considered view after a lot of examination&mdash;I can assure those people who are interested in it this morning&mdash;that no information has been put before us which would justify a royal commission. Certainly, there has been nothing put before this parliament this morning. None of the evidence put before the government so far or that can be derived from available records indicates that any Commonwealth government agencies involved in the security arrangements for that meeting in February 1978 acted in a manner other than in the proper discharge of their functions and duties. That is the conclusion that we have come to after much investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allegations that have cropped up, which Mr Haviland and Mr Abbott went through, of a conspiracy or work of ASIO&mdash;the failure to employ sniffer dogs, the disposal of the remains of the bomb, the conduct of subsequent investigations and so on&mdash;are all matters, every single one of them, clearly within the responsibility and authority of the government of New South Wales. They were and still are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the New South Wales government wants to have that royal commission, then that is a matter for it; we cannot stop that&mdash;and do not want to, may I repeat. But what I am saying is that all of these matters have been examined very carefully. If you go back through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and look at the answers that have been given, you will see that we have attempted to deal with these issues item by item, in particular in relation to the questions put by the member for North Sydney. They were extremely detailed questions. They are not questions that any Attorney-General at any time could have ignored in any way, and they were not. Hours and hours were put into the answers. No-one is complaining about that. There was no evidence to justify what the member for North Sydney was alleging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a couple of points on that. Under the division of responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales agencies, the Commonwealth, through ASIO, provided threat assessments. As for physical security, when we talk about the question of the rubbish bin, for example, the New South Wales police had the responsibility for security outside the Hilton Hotel, including George Street. It was not the Commonwealth; it was a New South Wales Police responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of people, including Mr Haviland this morning, in order to justify an inquiry, keep repeating as a fact the myth that ASIO conspired to plant a bomb in some deranged plot to force the Fraser government to recognise the importance of security agents and agencies and thereby increase their funding. The fact of that matter is that the truth is always more prosaic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you look at it in this instance, you see that it was not some deranged plot by ASIO that caused that to happen. It was the 1979 act and budget which arose out of the recommendations of the Hope royal commission, which were submitted to the Fraser government in 1977. If you look at the speech of Mr Fraser to parliament on 25 October 1978, you see that he puts this beyond doubt. The then Liberal government accepted Mr Justice Hope's recommendations and intended to act on them. If the decision to revise the ASIO Act and to increase ASIO's resources predates the bombing, then what rational motive could there be for ASIO to plant the bomb for that reason? That issue had been disposed of before that date. So that is not something that hangs together in any rational way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are concerned about these matters. We understand that. There are allegations that arise which have always been examined very carefully and have been answered in the most extensive detail. If you go through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and look at the answers and the work that has gone into it, you will see that we are still of the view that there is no need, no requirement, to have a new inquiry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Never once in all the court cases and inquiries have any of those responsible for the security of the Hilton given any explanation or been forced to be accountable. Instead, we have had an endless succession of inquiries and millions of dollars of public money wasted, with no hope of finding the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the reasons why the pressure for a genuine inquiry into the Hilton bombing will not stop&mdash;and it will not stop, until justice is delivered to those who died or were injured in the bombing. Three people were convicted of the crime, and later the same three were acquitted. Another is now in gaol on the same set of evidence which freed the other three. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has been avoiding the truth for 12 years. It is inconceivable that there exists one shred of justification in the pretence that calling the Commonwealth agencies and individuals to account for their actions 17 years ago could in any way prejudice security today. It can only have the opposite effect. The conclusion is inescapable: that the massive security failure at the Hilton was either breathtaking incompetence and negligence, or it has a more sinister explanation&mdash;or both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret to say that the present Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has continued the pattern of being a ministerial captive of the bureaucrats. His recent statements to Terry Griffiths, who has devoted 17 years to obtaining justice, are little short of contemptible. He has attempted to belittle Griffiths's efforts by implying that there is futility and pointlessness in going on about the Hilton; and he has insulted Griffiths's intelligence by constantly referring him back to the New South Wales authorities, when he is aware of the futility of a New South Wales inquiry being held without genuine Commonwealth cooperation. The Attorney-General should get some untainted advice from sources other than those in the bureaucracies and on his own staff with a vested interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pretence that continuing secrecy is synonymous with the effective operation of security and intelligence agencies and in the public interest but that exposing the truth about the Hilton is not is a chilling reinforcement of the public perception of the arrogance of this government. It only adds to the cancerous erosion of faith in the public institutions of this country which, alone, will probably result in a change of government at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked some 70 questions in this House about the Hilton bombing. The answers have been grudging, evasive, on occasions wrong and permeated with a `neither confirm nor deny' mantra. Yet what information has been gleaned has only added more questions and more doubts. There were hundreds of people in the bureaucracies and security agencies involved to some degree in the Hilton, and many of those have played a part in blocking inquiries ever since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent Holdich report simply raises more questions. All that report has done is reinforce the view recently put forward by the Premier of New South Wales when he said:</PARA>

<PARA>The Holdich report whitewashing ASIO is an insult to the public. The Attorney-General's acceptance of this report makes him an accomplice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to talk about an area of the law which I think is not often thought of or discussed by people, unless they are directly affected by it&mdash;and it is in the area of corporations law. I talk about the concept of class orders and the way that they operate to, indeed, change the Corporations Law. This is a matter with which I have been concerned for some time, because it relates to the way in which corporations, in their annual reports, report transactions with related third parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was prompted to think of this because of a report in this morning's paper that the piggery that was formerly owned by Mr Keating and his associates has now been totally sold offshore&mdash;with the final share from his former partner Mr Constantinidis being sold to, it is said, Singapore interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am interested in this matter because of the fact that, if there had not been a class order granted back in 1993, there would have been a requirement on the bank to report on the relationship between Mr Keating and the Commonwealth Bank and the nature of the loans he had from that bank. I am further concerned about this matter because, on the last day before the last election in 1993, a document dated 6 August 1992 in the name of D.N. Maynard of the Commonwealth Bank, purporting to be a report to the credit committee of the board, was the subject of a legal action by the Commonwealth Bank to prevent this document being published by Channel 10. It was an interim injunction that was sought and was gained. The action came back before the court on the following Tuesday, when&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;nobody was interested in debating it any further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accounting standards are of particular importance in the corporations law when you look at what happened in the 1980s and the lack of material that was available. You could say the background accounting standards, which apply to corporations on related party transaction disclosure, were developed to meet a perceived inadequacy of information available in annual reports to shareholders of activities of directors with companies they controlled. It was felt that disclosure of information required by this accounting standard would prevent the recurrence of the excesses of the 1980s. Thus we have accounting standards AAS22 and AASB1017 concerning related party transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Class orders had been obtained which effectively exempted directors and auditors from reporting on related party disclosures. This could be for quite sensible reasons: that is, it could involve spouses' Bankcard accounts or private small savings accounts&mdash;that sort of thing&mdash;which is very sensible. But there was a distinction to be made between, I believe, commercial banks and a government business enterprise&mdash;namely, the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, under the guidelines for financial statements of public authorities and commercial activities, which were issued by the Minister for Finance, it was said with regard to Accounting Standard AAS22 on related party transactions that `subject to Ministers not being taken to be related parties in relation to matters falling within their statutory responsibilities, they were to be exempted'. But in all other respects, ministers of the executive government were to be related parties for all public authorities and Commonwealth commercial entities. That is quite clearly meant to cover the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accounting Standard 1017 was amended. It was amended in order to toughen it up so that we could have a stronger accounting system. Immediately that amendment was gazetted, there was a letter written by the Australian Bankers Association to the Australian Securities Commission, asking for an expedited and amended class order to be given in respect of reporting on related third-party transactions. The worrying thing was that the conclusion of the letter says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore submitted that there is an overwhelming case for the ASC to extend the scope of the Class Order in the terms sought. If you wish any further information or explanation in support of the application please call&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and a man is named&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of Commonwealth Bank of Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and the phone number is given. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the financial year of Commonwealth Bank of Australia ends on June 30 1993, it is anxious to have the benefit of the ASC's ruling on the extended Class Order as soon as possible. Other member banks of the Australian Bankers' Association are similarly affected by the disclosure requirements but their financial years occur later in the calendar.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly this letter was written at the behest of the Commonwealth Bank with regard to expediting the granting of the extended class order because of their reporting period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week we had a public hearing of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. In the course of that hearing Mr Cameron, from the Australian Securities Commission, and legal counsel appeared before that committee. I asked the legal counsel, Mr Durbridge, who had drafted the class order giving the exemption, whether or not it had been brought to his attention that there was indeed a connection between Mr Keating and the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That document I referred to which had been subject to the injunction was in fact very much in the public domain. That document&mdash;the authenticity of which we know to be true because the Commonwealth Bank sought legal relief from it being published, and it was successful&mdash;shows one P. Keating to be a director-principal of the piggery group of companies. It also showed that there was a provision being made by the bank for the possibility of forgiving $4.5 million worth of the debt owed by that group of piggeries. This is contemporaneous with the Commonwealth Bank shutting down small farmers and small businesses. It is of concern that we have not had correct reporting on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would go back to the guidelines of the Minister for Finance, which indeed require ministers to be accountable when they are acting other than in the capacity of their duty as a minister. I do not believe that Mr Keating's investment in the piggery group of companies had anything to do with his ministerial responsibilities. I found it of deep concern, as did Mr Durbridge, when he answered my question by saying that had he known about the connection he certainly would have been at least hesitant and would have looked far more stringently at the application for the class order granting relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this series of events opens a large number of questions. These documents have been in the public arena, there are many questions being asked and I think it is time that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gave some answers.</PARA>

I note the announcement by the parliamentary secretary of the release of a video entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">It won't come back</EMPHASIS>. I also note the fact that there is a lot of publicity about issues for the hearing impaired and the deaf during this period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise the issue of the captioning of television in this country. They essentially show the soundtrack of television or video programs in a process whereby video captions are visible with an ordinary VCR showing the actual words in different colours so that people can distinguish the speakers. We had estimates in 1993 that as many as 999,800 people in this country have hearing loss or partial hearing loss&mdash;nearly one million people, according to the Bureau of Statistics, in 1993. So we are talking about a significant number of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put on the record an indication of the experience of people who suffer from these problems. One of my constituents, Mr Nicholas Tayeh, who has been a constant campaigner on this matter, says of his son's experience:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as the father of a 22 year old profoundly deaf son, I know being deaf is a most unpleasant disability. The isolation that results from it can lead to depression which, in all its forms&mdash;insomnia, irritability etc.&mdash;can affect employment, lifestyle, social and family life, and that worries me very much. Being able to re-establish lines of communication and being up to date with current events can help break this vicious cycle of isolation and depression and help deaf people, especially the young deaf people, not to give up!</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Tayeh has, on a number of occasions, raised this matter. I put on record appreciation for people like Senator Hill, former Senator Sowada and Senator Bourne, who have also in this parliament raised with the government this issue and the need for the government to be a bit more pro-active with regard to finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the National Working Party on Captioning, which was established in December 1991, is that by 2010 all programs on Australian TV networks will be captioned. Its aim for the immediate term is that by the year 2000 all government videos will be captioned. The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations has some very nice wording in their code of practice. They say they seek to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . closed-captioned programs are clearly indicated in program information&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>big deal because we do not have many of them. They will also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">endeavour to increase the amount of closed-captioned programming, in consultation with organisations representing hearing-impaired and deaf viewers.</PARA>
<PARA>Substantially, very few programs are captioned&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>, the occasional documentary and some dramas. In actual fact, only 7 1/2 per cent of national television is captioned at the moment. These people have a long way to go to accomplish anything near what they seek. There has been captioning since 1982, mainly in the government television sector. There has been the occasional $5,000 from FACTS. In 1994-95, $231,000 was allocated by the government for video captioning and ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> and a further half a million dollars came from the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been various excuses for not captioning more&mdash;there is some, I guess, validity in them&mdash;which include that we do not have a national news, as various states do their own localised news reporting, and therefore the cost in this country would not be comparable to Canada or the US. But it is still not good enough that ABC television captions only 20 hours a week, and that is half of the national effort. The ABC endeavour is half of what we do nationally. It is still not good enough that we have captioning for only 7 1/2 per cent of all programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been, as I say, a number of references to overseas situations. The BBC is currently captioning 28 hours each week, on BBC1 and BBC2. These are all national bulletins, and the BBC has plans to be captioning regional bulletins by next year. Four years ago it was captioning no news at all. ITV in England currently captions 14 hours of news each week. In the United States and Canada more and more cable stations are providing captioning. Virtually every free to air television station broadcasting news in the USA provides some news captioning service. So things are happening internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been estimates of the cost of a hybrid style of captioning. These figures indicate that this matter should be put a lot higher on the agenda in this country. There has unfortunately been a bit of buck shoving between the human services portfolio and the communications department in regards to getting anything done on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the options suggested were four variations for news captioning of the ABC news. The one-off establishment cost under one scheme is as low as $268,000. The highest estimate cost for an alternative is a bit over a million dollars. Ongoing costs would be approximately $1.2 million to $1.5 million. This would be of value to nearly one million Australians. In looking at the amounts of money devoted to other requirements in this country, I really think we have to question our priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a degree of government action on the matter. The government's national conference in 1994 in Hobart carried a resolution which stated that Labor will fund services and programs that promote a competent and positive image of people with disabilities and ensure their lifestyles are as similar as possible to those of the general community where possible through a process of integration. Labor supports the provision of subtitling of news and current affairs on ABC and SBS television. So there was a commitment to do something about this issue. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Captioning has also been found in a number of the United States studies to be extremely useful for children with learning disabilities and for those people attempting to learn English. The University of Maryland surveyed comparative groups in both of those classes and found that there was a very quantitative and real ability to improve their skills. A study commissioned by the National Captioning Institute in the United States in regard to those learning English as a second language concluded:</PARA>

<PARA>It is not just the reality of nearly one million Australians who have been seriously deprived of information, who are struggling to know what is going on around them and who are deprived of opportunities for knowledge and pleasure; it is these other groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subtitles are needed because deaf and hearing impaired people need to have access to correct information at the same time as hearing people. They need to learn about the world through TV as they are unable to hear the radio.

They should be able to rely on more than just the newspapers to get a view on issues. Increasingly in this country the monopolisation of the media makes that an even more imperative move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time, particularly during National Hearing and Deafness Awareness Week, that this government stopped worrying about whether this or that minister can pass the letter over to the other minister and whether we can have further delays to make sure that nothing occurs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the days on Tin Pan Alley, the music industry has been famous for its shonky deals and rip-offs. I suppose it is only appropriate that a government led by an old rock and roller, Bankstown's answer to Andrew Loog Oldham, should be continuing this tradition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it made the decision to maintain import controls on CDs in April this year, the government decided to continue to force Australian consumers to pay CD prices of up to $9 more than in overseas markets. It abandoned five years worth of efforts to tackle the overpriced music market and made a decision that ignored local consumers and only benefited the tiny handful of multinationals&mdash;EMI, Sony, BMG, Warners and Polygram&mdash;that dominate the recording industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, music lovers are not the only people who will be paying more under this policy. It will also affect would-be purchasers of books and computer software. We are told that this decision is vital to ensure a vibrant Australian music industry, to protect our cultural identity and prevent our domination by overseas sounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great irony that this government, with all its republican pretensions, has based its decision around laws that stem from the days of the British empire. The big record companies originally won their import monopoly under laws we adapted years ago from British legislation designed to protect the monopoly of British publishers in what were then called colonial markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1990, the Prices Surveillance Authority found that international recording companies were slugging local consumers for CDs, compared with prices charged in the US and in Europe. Australian CD prices were consistently higher, sometimes up to 40 per cent. The PSA recommended that parallel importing be allowed as it would result in significantly reduced prices for consumers. As a result of this, the cabinet agreed in June 1992 to amend the Copyright Act to allow the parallel importation of new release sound recordings by foreign artists from five Western countries from 1 July 1994. Despite opposition from the industry, legislation to implement this move was introduced in December 1992 but it lapsed with the dissolution of the parliament before the 1993 election. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record companies claimed in their defence that they needed to charge high prices for imported CDs to finance the cost of publishing Australian performers. However, the PSA also found that companies did not appear to be spending significantly to develop local talent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recording giants then argued that parallel importing would increase piracy. This is despite the fact that the biggest piracy problems they experience in Australia come from locally produced product. They tried to use intellectual property law before finally settling for the argument that the government's proposed package of reforms was contrary to GATT. This was then backed up by a submission from the Attorney-General's Department arguing that excluding Australian artists from parallel importation was in effect a protectionist measure unsustainable in the new world trading environment that had evolved since the 1992 decision was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reversal of the 1992 decision came the same week or the week after agreement was reached on the Hilmer reforms. The government suddenly became very selective over which micro-economic reforms and competition reforms it actually wanted. Rather than opening up the music industry in the way GATT had intended, the government used GATT as an excuse to return to the bad old days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over recent years the government has developed a very cosy relationship with the arts community, a group that has been credited with providing crucial votes at the last election. The arts lobby was well rewarded last year with $250 million in the Creative Nation package. Offering further recompense through import protection on music has surely stretched generosity to the limit, especially when we consider who the real beneficiaries have been. It was interesting to read the comments of a buyer for a chain of music stores in the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> just before the government's decision was announced. The spokesperson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We pay extremely high prices&mdash;they are much more expensive than in America. The record companies are very powerful in this country and this will keep the power in their hands.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Consumers Association Chief Executive, Louise Sylvan, echoed this view at the same time when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government ought to be given a Grammy Award for its indecisive performance in this area of microeconomic reform. . . Having decided in 1992 to ensure a better deal for consumers by deregulating import provisions, the government is now set to go into reverse gear.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Sylvan told media representatives the background was `a product of the intense lobbying of the multinational record companies'. She said that Australian consumers deserve better than this from their own government. Another ACA spokesperson, Gail Kennedy, said it was unfair that Australians were deprived of access to reasonably priced CDs. She told journalists that CDs&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . are so much cheaper in other countries and it's not fair that the current price disparity is maintained . . . the price disparity between Australia and overseas is pretty tough&mdash;there is a marked difference, a very generous gap. That's a tough thing for consumers to accept&mdash;they shouldn't have to.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Kennedy also pointed out the ridiculousness of the restriction at a time when the government is supposedly trying to introduce more competition to other industries. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we are supposed to be pushing for a level playing field, consumers of CDs must be wondering which end of the field they are on. When we are supposed to have a policy of producing competitive industries, how can this be justified?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) was concerned about the decision. A cabinet submission stated her belief that `the 1992 decision and public commitment to allow parallel importing is in the best interests of consumers and should stand'. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . CD prices remain too high, even if the differentials [in price between the US and Australia] have narrowed, and that consumer groups and the general public are likely to vigorously challenge the claim that the price of CDs has fallen.</PARA>
<PARA>If I have quoted at length, it is only because there is simply no excuse for the way in which the government has acted on this matter. There has never been any `ground up' review of the recording industry and how it serves Australia's economic interests. There has been no independent review by the Industry Commission, or even an internal review by the Bureau of Industry Economics. We simply have no idea what ministers and their advisers and officials have based their recommendations and final decisions on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has claimed that, by paying higher prices for offerings from established acts, local consumers are helping fund and foster the development of new Australian talent. But, at the same time, it likes to claim that the price gap with comparable markets has shrunk. This argument is entirely self-defeating. If there is no longer any significant price difference, the existing arrangements obviously cannot be generating any significant subsidies for the development of local product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has already been a considerable amount of discussion over direct government assistance to the music industry. At least this sort of measure would be transparent and would provide a level of accountability when opposed to the entirely self-serving and sanctimonious arguments its representatives use to justify their current approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we will do well to remember that most Australian artists&mdash;like much innovative music the world over&mdash;have been developed by independent promoters and recording companies. If these companies were allowed to compete for distribution business and gain more commercial strength, they would do an even better job promoting our new performers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Past Australian consumption of recorded music has been low by international standards because of high costs. Simple laws of supply and demand suggest that, if CDs were more fairly priced, the recording industries would benefit as consumers would buy more product. This government's policy favours the music establishment and it penalises consumers. It especially hits young consumers&mdash;people with limited cash to spend, but the groups that would be crucial in breaking new acts&mdash;so, ultimately, this policy is self-defeating. </PARA>

The PSA went on to say that it was possible for the banks to provide satisfactory no-frills accounts and that already there are some bank accounts that come close to that objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opponents of no-frills accounts describe those who advocate the accounts' introduction as calling for free banking. We are doing no such thing. Nothing could be further from the truth. Advocates of no-frills accounts want a basic banking account which will serve people on lower incomes and not cost those individuals or families an arm and a leg to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about a basic banking product where there is a limited number of free or minimal cost transactions per month. We are not saying that other customers should be massively subsidising someone who wants to go to the bank and withdraw $5 over the counter every day for a fortnight. We are not suggesting that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about a no-frills account we are talking about no fees as long as the basic banking product limits are not exceeded by the customer. We are talking about, perhaps, no interest if the essential basic banking product is provided. We are talking about customers being limited to one basic banking product and no other transaction accounts. We are definitely talking about universal access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about a product that people can access legitimately at minimal cost. We are not proposing that people should be able to abuse the system by turning up every day and withdrawing $1. We are not saying that at all. We are not talking about free banking. We are talking about fair and reasonable access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the banking system to date the existing structure of fees and charges has been particularly hurting pensioners and families, who rarely have a minimum bank balance of $500. There are not that many families I know of that carry a minimum balance of $500 as they struggle to make ends meet and bring up their children; the situation is similar, the people on the basic rate of pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PSA report places the onus fairly and squarely on banks to stop hiding behind the fake figures they have been presenting to the public. Probably no organisation in the banking industry has been more guilty of this approach, I say sadly, than the Commonwealth Bank. Some time ago the banks put about an argument that was really Alice in Wonderland stuff. They came up with the claim that the establishment of a basic banking product account would cost the banks and the community $1 billion a year. It was simply unbelievable and incredible. What were they proposing would come with the account? Champagne for every dollar handed across? Caviar? It was clearly nonsense and has been clearly exposed as nonsense by the PSA report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, probably no bank has been more guilty of that approach than the Commonwealth Bank. Mr David Murray, the Chairman of the Australian Bankers Association and the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank, had this to say at a recent Bankers Association dinner:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The argument&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>about bank fees and charges&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has been allowed to focus on issues such as our margins, such as our social responsibility. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shock, horror! How terrible it is that the public should be debating bank margins and social responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, Mr Murray, and all those other bankers out there, the argument has focused on the issues of margins, social responsibility and costs&mdash;and so it should. What does Mr Murray think we should be arguing about? The colour of the carpets in the banks? Really, what Mr Murray and many other bankers have been saying is that the banks are above scrutiny; that their figures should not be questioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, Mr Murray went on to say that arguments about margins, costs and social responsibility were red herrings. Well, they are not. The banks have tendered their costings based on a system which pretends that the cost of each transaction is the same and that, because they make more money from larger accounts than smaller accounts, somehow the larger accounts are subsidising the smaller accounts. It takes very little time in a bank to see that the average pensioner's transaction takes only the fraction of the time of someone bringing in the weekend takings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Bank has been particularly guilty of leading this propaganda charge and peddling a lot of misleading arguments. For example, the Commonwealth Bank claims that it gives exemptions from its fees and charges to pensioners. I thought that for a week or two myself, until I discovered that the Commonwealth Bank's exemptions do not apply to new pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you were a pensioner as of tomorrow and walked into the Commonwealth Bank, you would not be exempt at all. Any new customer who goes into the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;say they receive a DSS age pension or a veteran's pension&mdash;will be hit by the fees, along with low income families, unemployed people, other pensioners and children with small accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the banks have set out to drive some of the less well off out of the banking system. What is to be done about it? Firstly, the public should not take out their frustrations on bank staff. They must address their concerns to management and the board. The policies of the board are not the responsibility of bank staff, who are doing their best to earn a living and provide for their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the government, in the light of the PSA report, must consider a range of options in its policy development. One option for serious consideration is to amend the code of banking practice to provide a guarantee of access to banking services for all customers. Industry based codes are one of the best ways of ensuring a fair and flexible market for services. An amendment to the code requiring banks to provide affordable financial transaction accounts and a guarantee that all consumers have the right of access to such accounts would be one course of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the ABA and other bankers are genuine, they would readily approach the government to begin discussions. Given the number of banks that have indicated privately to me and others, including the PSA, that they have no problems in bringing in a no-frills account, why will they not proceed forthwith? It would not be such a big step if they were to do what they say privately they are already doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that the acceptance of a code which is committed to a basic banking product, among other things, might well become a condition of receiving a banking licence. As a community, perhaps we should consider public hearings for licence issue and/or renewal. Certainly, given the recent experience with the Commonwealth Bank, the code should provide for effective notification procedures for fee charges and changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are all matters that could be taken up in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. Some banks have clearly issued a deliberate challenge to the PSA and the government by acting against PSA recommendations and not moving towards introduction of a basic banking account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, the banks are not on their own. The opposition shares their view. The opposition thinks that the existing level of fees and charges is fine. Its philosophy on tax is that the lower your income the higher the amount of tax you pay, and the higher your income the lower the amount of tax you pay. Of course, that is the whole philosophy behind the existing structure of bank fees and charges. If the Australian people are looking to the opposition for action on this, then, as in so many other areas, they can forget it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am committed&mdash;and I am sure many members of this government are committed&mdash;to ensuring that low income families and pensioners get a fair go, and are not driven out of the banking system&mdash;and that we have a banking system which pays appropriate heed to the whole concept of social responsibility, fairness and equity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will hold the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) to his commitment to ensure that we see a better performance and better practices from banks. Part of what I want to say relates to that very subject from a different perspective. I speak on behalf of people who are going without and on behalf of the needy. I am particularly aggrieved at the continuing lack of consideration the government provides to my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been a member of this parliament for a little longer than two years now, patiently waiting for some sort of consideration for the desperate people I represent in the Wimmera-Mallee. There are a number of matters I could mention, but none epitomises the government's neglect more than the refusal to grant exceptional circumstances drought assistance to Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Mallee and Wimmera regions of my electorate are heavily dependent on the agriculture that surrounds them. In fact, agriculture is the very source of the local economy. When things are bad for agriculture, it flows right through the economic sector. It follows that small businesses in the service sector suffer equally cruelly when agriculture is on its knees. This means that there are many families in small businesses who are added to the already large number of farming families who are going without&mdash;the very same sort of people the member for Lilley was referring to in his remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has already been a decade of extremely poor commodity prices which has created an unbelievably heavy debt load and financial burden. Add to this a period of unprecedentedly high interest rates created by deliberate government policy and you have the current dire circumstances experienced by many of the families in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that whole decade of difficulty, add another three failed seasons in a row. The first of these seasons was because of excessive rainfall right in the middle of the harvest in 1992-93. It actually ruined what would have been a good harvest. The second was because of a mouse plague in 1993-94 which ate the crop before it even had a chance to grow. These are the difficulties and challenges faced by people who work the land. The third was because of the record drought in 1994-95, which I am addressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial strain of excessive borrowing to cope with all these failed seasons has been intolerable. The member for Lilley spoke about banks and banking practices. Sadly, there are now far too many families in my electorate being crushed under the heel and the demand of banks wanting to sell them up. Small business, as well as the farming sector, has suffered the same fate.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial hardship and despair all this has generated leaves a huge number of people I represent completely disillusioned about the good intentions of the current government. They are fairly determined and resilient folk, but they wonder how many more times they are going to be slapped in the face and denied their genuine requests for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate is one of the 16th poorest electorates represented in this chamber. The member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) earlier today made reference to poverty. My electorate is no different. The nearest formal statistics for Mallee I have relate to the 1991 census. They are bad enough, but things have deteriorated since. A staggering 23.2 per cent of families in Mallee have annual incomes of less than $16,000 per annum. The members in this House ought to consider how they could survive trying to educate their children through to tertiary education, paying for their expenses to attend schools in metropolitan centres, yet being denied access to Austudy because of their perceived wealth in assets while having incomes as low as $16,000 per annum and lower. It is not a very wealthy electorate in terms of total income. Only 7.7 per cent have family incomes in excess of $60,000 per annum. These are 1991 statistics, but I can assure you that anecdotal evidence suggests that things have deteriorated since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mallee has the 12th lowest median family income&mdash;an average of $26,585 per annum. These are appalling statistics. Is it any wonder the socioeconomic fabric of many families is falling down around their ears? It does not give me much joy to stand here in this place and bring these facts before the parliament, but it needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with this background that I would have thought the government would have given a much more favourable consideration to Victoria's application for drought assistance. Not one senior minister visited the north-west of Victoria to inspect personally the hardship being experienced. Although the government did send out the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Nick Sherry, and I appreciated his visit, it was well after the event. Many of my people have asked me to ask the government and those who sit on the government benches: do you really care?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says it relies heavily on the report of the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Committee, RASAC, which recommended refusal of Victoria's application. Up until half an hour ago, the government was refusing to make that report available as a public document. They have since done so, and I have a copy with me. It is very interesting reading through this report. It seems inconceivable to me that the report would say that major droughts in Victoria in 1967-68 and in 1982-83, according to the current criteria to assess exceptional circumstances, would not be severe droughts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) would remember, as I do, the droughts of 1968 and 1982. These were substantial droughts. Who will forget those unbelievable dust storms which engulfed many of our capital cities, and have since been immortalised in postcards and calendar photographs? Remember those rolling dust storms. They were the droughts of 1968 and 1982. Yet the criteria used to assess Victoria's drought application would say that those were not severe droughts. I am bitterly disappointed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social and economic decline of my electorate after a decade of Labor with its high interest policies and its lack of decency and consideration has decimated my patch. The strain on social welfare is starting to show. There is a plethora of welfare groups in my electorate. I was recently approached by the local corps of the Salvation Army from Swan Hill. It is a very sad day when we have come to rely on voluntary agencies like the Salvation Army to provide welfare aid, but that is a reality. Determined, proud people have been reduced to come cap in hand, humiliated, to ask for charity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a letter here from an officer of the Swan Hill Corps, Lieutenant Mick Gray. He advises me that the government has reduced its aid to needy families across Australia by reducing the allocation to the Salvation Army relief fund by a staggering 25 per cent. What this means for Lieutenant Gray is that he now has about $5,000 left to meet the needs of the north-west of Victoria, which his corps services. He advises me in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the region's major provider of welfare relief, I struggle to see that it will be possible to continue to provide the level of service to this district as these funds will run out in November/December.</PARA>
<PARA>He urges me further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, we would request that you intervene on our behalf with our Federal Parliament with the view to obtaining further funding for the Salvation Army in the Swan Hill area.</PARA>
<PARA>I am doing just that as part of this grievance. I add to the remarks made earlier in the day by the member for Hinkler, who has drawn this urgency to the attention of the House. Nowhere is it being harder felt than in the Mallee region of the north-west of Victoria. Hardworking, honest people are reduced to asking the government for help, despite a history of determined independence and resilience. That is how desperate things have got. I am urging the government to give far better and decent consideration to the desperate people of north-west Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in debate today to again record, as I have done on numerous occasions since I became a member of this parliament in 1990, the concerns of my constituents regarding the construction of the Badgerys Creek airport and to put the facts before the parliament so that they will be recorded out there in the electorate at large, instead of some of the misinformation that seems to be going around now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times I have both attended and addressed airport meetings within the Prospect electorate regarding the proposed airport. In doing so, I have listened to the concerns of my constituents and conveyed to the ministers those concerns that my constituents are expressing. Most of the concerns are, at this stage, lack of knowledge of the flight paths and the direction which they will take, even though repeated assurances have been given, following investigations and studies into noise, water pollution and contours, that this will take place. The ensuing debate is now around the curfew and the concerns that people have that this is going to be a non-curfew airport, and therefore they are going to have jets going over at 2, 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This came to mind today because there was an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph</EMPHASIS> stating that the Kingsford-Smith airport can no longer cope with more flights and that it looks like we are going to have to move posthaste with Badgerys Creek. I know this is a commitment that our government has given time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, some of the misinformation that is going around is from some of the citizen action groups. I particularly acknowledge and always defend the right of all people to come together in meetings to demonstrate, talk, debate or at least have their grievances heard. I am particularly concerned when I find in my local newspaper as of yesterday that certain so-called citizens of my community, even though I know these particular citizens do not live in my community, state that it must be remembered that the federal opposition has now promised to complete an environmental impact statement if it wins the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This person, Ms Vella, knows this is incorrect. To make sure the facts are getting across, I think it is about time we start having them, once again, brought into this parliament. We do know that some journalists&mdash;I say `some journalists'&mdash;do not like to have the facts stand in the way of a good story. But I think what they have to do is acknowledge when people make outrageous statements such as this and at least on occasion check their facts. I will give you some facts. Fact No. 1 is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Howard's Report</EMPHASIS> of July 1995 to all Bennelong residents. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will also ensure the construction of the new airport at Badgery's Creek to international level as a matter of priority. Unlike the Government, we appreciate the urgent need for a second Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, they have failed to adequately develop the second airport at Badgery's Creek despite giving this undertaking prior to the new runway's construction.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) went on to tell his constituents that the measures outlined by our Labor government in the budget to address the issues are grossly inadequate. Fact No. 2 relates to information of him going to go on, as quoted by a citizen in my electorate, with a full EIS. That is certainly contrary to what he wrote to Mr Geoff Grace, chairman of CRASH. A letter he addressed to Mr Grace on 9 July 1995 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to Sydney West (Badgery's Creek) Airport, the Coalition will ensure that the site is developed to full international standards as a matter of urgency. We appreciate the need for a second Sydney airport, particularly in light of the 2000 Olympics, and believe that in time, Sydney West Airport will have a major role in servicing the air traffic needs of the Sydney Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that The Badgery's Creek site was approved for development in late 1985. Despite repeated assurances to the contrary, the current Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning us&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has demonstrated a clear lack of commitment to this project and their intention to meet their recent Budget commitments must be reviewed with a great deal of scepticism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That letter also referred to the bill the Leader of the Opposition had introduced in the parliament, but he went on to say about the government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through its failure to support my Bill, its plans to downgrade the east-west runway and its lack of commitment to the development of Sydney West Airport, the Government has once again demonstrated its inability to adequately deal with the long-term social and environmental problems associated with aircraft noise over Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA>I am repeating these facts because the citizens of the community are under the false impressions&mdash;I say `some citizens'; maybe they are apologists for the Liberal Party&mdash;that the coalition is concerned about people who live in western Sydney. The coalition is going to do a complete environmental impact statement, other than the one that was already done in 1985 and which our government has already given a commitment to supplement, to make sure that no airport development takes place until all that supplementation investigation has been carried out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is clear that, before I get another chance to speak in a grievance debate, an election will be upon us. Today most Australians know that something is wrong in this country, but they do not quite know what the problem is. However, what they do know is that their costs of living are rising and that a growing number of them are not able to meet their commitments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1990 election campaign some literature was distributed in my electorate saying, `Don't vote for the Liberals because they'll sell the Commonwealth Bank.' In 1995 it is not the Liberals who are selling the Commonwealth Bank but those across the track&mdash;those from the Labor Party who said that they would never sell it. This was not as the result of a lengthy debate in caucus but rather a fait accompli at 6.45 on the night the budget was being delivered. After the budget documents had been printed, it was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the Labor caucus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition told the Australian people that it had no objections to the selling of the Commonwealth Bank. We were up-front and honest with the electorate. The Prime Minister, on the other hand, not only changed the line that had been presented to the Australian people but did not even allow his elected members to vote on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, when we presented a comprehensive taxation package to the electorate, the Prime Minister said, `This will be a referendum on taxation.' He categorically stated that there would be no new taxes and that would be l-a-w, law. The total taxation revenue in 1992-93, the last year before the 1993 election, was $89.435 billion, as shown on page 4.57 of this year's Budget Paper No. 1. In 1995-96, this financial year, the total taxation revenue has risen to $119.261 billion. That means this year alone, over and above the amount that would have been collected annually in 1992-93, an additional collection of $29.826 billion in taxation. So much for l-a-w, law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, the wholesale sales tax collections were $9.25 billion. As of 1 July 1995, Australians will pay $14.16 billion in wholesale sales tax. That is about $785 per person per year or, for the average family of four, they will pay about $60 per week in wholesale sales tax out of their wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Australian consumer does not see where the wholesale sales tax is paid by the retailer, which is then added to the retail price. All the consumer knows is that the prices are going up. In 1993, the federal government collected $7.2 billion in fuel excise. This year they will collect $10.3 billion in fuel excise. In 1993, the Labor government told us they would reduce company tax to help businesses, yet in 1995-96 we have seen an increase of three per cent and the collection now of $17.14 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has chosen to abuse the truth and abuse the responsibilities that are entrusted to it in this place. Governments in this place should be about presenting the facts and producing policies that will look after the interests of the people they represent, but this government has been about camouflaging the facts and printing distorted information that cannot be cross-referenced. It has been about providing grants in government seats, particularly in marginal seats, without the same provisions for opposition seats, as we saw in the sports rorts affair. We had to question this government week in, week out through debates in this place to reveal the truth, and the minister eventually resigned as a result of the white board incident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government proudly tells us that they are carrying out micro-economic reform, and they have spent $400 million on improving efficiency on the waterfront. Some may say that that is good and, in fact, efficiency improvements on the waterfront would be good. However, when they find out that as a result of the government spending this $400 million it now takes ships longer to turn around than before they commenced this process, these words seem rather hollow indeed. It raises the question: is this really as good as it gets?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The balance of trade in this country has been going backwards for some time. It was $2.9 billion in one month of this year and regularly has been around $2.5 billion per month. This is money that we do not have, but it is money that we or our children or our children's children will eventually have to pay back to the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government wants to tell us that they are addressing the problems and our exports are increasing, and they quote figures to confirm this. But what they do not tell us is that the Asian region in particular has been growing rapidly and that we are not maintaining our market share as a percentage of that growth in these exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are opportunities for us to produce products in this country and to value add. We do offer a secure location for companies. But why would they establish a manufacturing operation in this country when our Asian neighbours are providing five-year tax holidays or other incentives to encourage businesses to establish themselves?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would they come here to be hit with the sorts of taxation systems that we have at the moment? For example, the fringe benefits tax requires taxes on car parks that are difficult to understand and to work out and which require logbooks on vehicles, meals and a range of other issues. In 1995-96 the fringe benefits tax will collect $2.84 billion&mdash;a real incentive for many of these businesses to get functional in this country!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Massive taxation increases have been required over the years to fund government implemented programs. Some of them have been necessary, but many of them have been introduced for no more cynical reason than as a vote buying exercise prior to an election. This is so much so that voters have been conditioned to wait for the handouts that will be provided at election time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 35 years we have seen expenditure in infrastructure in this country fall from just under eight per cent to around four per cent. It begs the question: how many real jobs could we create if we looked again into this area of improvement and infrastructure? I am pleased to see in Victoria that Jeff Kennett is actually doing some of that work in infrastructure to create some of the real jobs that are necessary in our country. If we were able to create an environment in which the 800,000-plus small businesses in this country could see the light at the end of the tunnel and employ just one more person, we would have no unemployment problems in this country today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, we have seen this government use every method possible to camouflage the real unemployment figures. We have seen massive increases in the numbers completing tertiary education. Whilst I acknowledge the need to improve education standards to keep pace with the changes in technology, the jobs have not been there on the completion of these qualifications. These days large numbers of university graduates are working behind hotel bars or waiting on tables&mdash;not to pay their way through university as they used to, but because they cannot find a job in their chosen field with the qualifications they have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a range of employment schemes in this country to get our long-term unemployed off the long-term unemployment list. Some of them will get permanent jobs. However, many of them will go back onto the unemployment list and will no longer be shown on the list as long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people may consider my comments from time to time to be critical of the unemployed. But let me say that few people in this place have invited the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) to their electorate, as I have, to expound his schemes. Whilst I do not necessarily agree with him, if we could create jobs through those schemes to allow some of these people to be&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the grievance debate today to talk about a survey I recently concluded in my electorate and to talk about some of the results from that survey, particularly in relation to what a lot of people in Victoria think about the Kennett government. We recently completed this survey and had over 4,300 responses. A range of concerns was highlighted in those responses, particularly about the actions of the Kennett Liberal government. They were the sorts of concerns that people are facing in Victoria and have faced over the last 2 1/2 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns cover a range of issues and I will focus on some of them today. One concern in particular was the issue of local government amalgamations, those reforms and particularly the removal of democratically elected councils and their replacements with unelected commissioners. The concerns relate to the inability to have a situation where people can contact representatives from their council to address the minor concerns, which are major to them, that relate to their local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances are that commissioners in general have not been able to reach the public's expectations with respect to this issue. I have been relatively lucky in my local area, particularly in the city of Greater Dandenong; but certainly the view of the community is that that is a difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kennett government originally planned for elections to be held in those councils in March 1996. Subsequently, they changed that to March 1997. That was criticised by a number of commissioners. In fact, recently the chief commissioner of the city of Monash cited that as one of the reasons why he was retiring from his position early. He said that he just could not possibly stay in the job for that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also heard the Premier comment on that issue again in regard to the city of Melbourne. He recently said that it could be five years before there was a democratically elected council in the city of Melbourne. This is a basic issue of democracy. It is an issue of concern to me and to many residents of Melbourne. What we are seeing is an attempt to abrogate the government's responsibility to be accountable&mdash;a situation where, on a continuing basis, unelected representatives of the people are acting on behalf of the government, often in a way which is seen to be detrimental to the needs of the local residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise an issue involving ethnic communities in Victoria and their situation with the state government. Ethnic communities in Victoria are many and varied. They are small and large. They come from well over 100 countries. They are often tight-knit and they are often in need of government support. People from non-English speaking backgrounds often find it more difficult to access health services and education services and also find it more difficult to compete in the employment market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Ethnic Affairs in the Victorian government is in fact the Premier. Over the last 2 1/2 years, in my travels around not only my electorate but most of metropolitan Melbourne, I have attended many functions of many and varied ethnic communities. I am yet to attend a function where the Minister for Ethnics Affairs from the state government has been present. There have been present on occasions a representative of the Premier, assorted backbenchers or a parliamentary secretary, but the minister himself has not appeared to be able to avail himself to those communities&mdash;that is, unless there is an issue that he sees is of some political significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue that particularly comes to mind is that which involved the Greek community and the Macedonian community some time ago. The Premier was very vocal in support of the Greek community on that issue. Without going into the detail of that issue, I say this: a government that is led by a person who seeks to be divisive and to act to support one part of the community he represents versus another on an issue which essentially is not in the bailiwick of his government is really playing with fire. That has been the way the Premier, as ethnic affairs minister, has sought to act within the Victorian government. I think it is a very sorry state of affairs and it shows something about the way he sees people should play politics in a state: by being parochial and essentially trying to turn one part of the community against another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue which has come up in recent times is freeway tolls. The state government has a proposal for a rather massive infrastructure development entitled the Citylink, which is a major freeway redevelopment in metropolitan Melbourne. I think that any resident of Melbourne would know that traffic on freeways as they stand at present and the difficulties that exist are significant, but this proposal is really a Rolls Royce proposal to deal with a problem which is not of that significance. It also ignores dealing with what could be done about improving public transport links. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contrast that with the involvement of the federal government through the better cities program and the recent extension of the metropolitan rail line in Victoria to Cranbourne in my electorate. That was a major infrastructure development&mdash;over $30 million worth of expenditure&mdash;which has seen public transport usage in that area increase significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation as it now stands is that the government is going to go ahead with tolls. I, just as others have, sound a warning now to the Victorian government: tolls have been found throughout Australia to be an unpopular initiative, an initiative which the public in general have been shown to be averse to. A toll such as that proposed would involve something along the lines of a $3 one-way trip. Therefore, it would cost an average family which was travelling regularly along those roads to work and so forth something like $1,500 per annum, which is a significant cost to a family. It will affect large numbers of residents of Melbourne, in both the Tullamarine corridor and my own area through the south-eastern arterial. There are alternatives for the way this could have been done. This option will effectively be very adverse to ordinary working families within the Melbourne metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of other issues have come up. Health and education are two major issues. In relation to the issue of health in Victoria, major hospital disputes have occurred, in which the Premier's role can at best be described as destructive and, at worst, deceptive. In relation to the ambulance service, there have been increasing difficulties in actually getting service. We have had a number of small but significant horror stories communicated to us in the office about what has occurred with the ambulance service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to education, class sizes are growing on a continual basis. Schools are being pitted against one another through the schools of the future program. The end result of that will be that a lot of schools which are in real need of additional resources will not get them. Schools have closed throughout the metropolitan and country areas of Victoria, and that has created additional pressure on the ability of local communities to access the services that they need for their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of taxation and charges, there has been a very major turnaround. In the early 1990s, the Liberal Party in this chamber and also in the Victorian opposition at that stage were always railing against the question of taxation and charges. Yet, with respect to the Kennett government, we have seen a $100 deficit levy allocated to each property in the state of Victoria. There is no equity in this measure. It is $100 for a one-bedroom flat in Broadmeadows. It is also $100 for a huge mansion in Toorak. It is not about equity; it is a taxation revenue measure. It is not about equity; it is about getting money in the coffers, with no concern for the social justice implications of the measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar flat rate is charged for water and sewerage&mdash;$24 for water, $24 for sewerage. Again, it does not matter what the size of your property or your water usage is, you cop that charge straight up-front. The state government in Victoria is now, as I understand it, the highest taxing state government in the country. We hear rumours from the government about removing those charges before an election, but the fact is that they are still there and they continue to be a real drain on the coffers of ordinary working families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the Kennett government in Victoria&mdash;and it will also be a problem if the coalition government succeeds in the federal sphere&mdash;is the question of lean government versus mean government. This current federal government has been criticised over the last few years for cutbacks in the Public Service and for the changes it has made in terms of economic restructuring, but essentially we have tried to temper that with improvements to the social security system and the overall social justice system in this country which will allow families to live in comfort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victoria has a mean government. It is a mean government that will not act upon the needs of the local community. It introduces charges without any concern for their impact on people. It is a government which does not care about the concerns of the average Victorian. In the federal sphere, the opposition&mdash;the government in waiting&mdash;will follow the same sorts of policies in government, as has clearly been shown by its recent comments to the media on public service reform. What has occurred in Victoria should not occur at a federal level. What has occurred in Victoria is something that should be redressed in the near future when the Kennett government gets around to calling an election. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has developed a bold plan to provide Australians with higher retirement incomes and to boost national saving and investment. Compulsory superannuation is the cornerstone of the government's strategy. Since the late 1980s, employers have contributed for their employees under awards and the superannuation guarantee. As a result, over 90 per cent of Australian employees now have superannuation, up from less than 40 per cent a decade ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer (Mr Willis) announced a further boost to superannuation in the last budget. From 1997, many employees will begin making their own superannuation contributions paid from award wage rises. In addition, most workers making superannuation contributions will be able to claim a matching government payment in their tax returns. The result is that most workers will have the equivalent of 15 per cent of salary paid into superannuation by the year 2003. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government remains firmly committed to maintaining the pension for those who need it. Our policies mean Australians will have more income in retirement through a combination of superannuation and part pension. Superannuation assets are expected to increase tenfold in the next 25 years. This brings important responsibilities for both the government and the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For its part, the government has sought to strengthen public confidence in superannuation by:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">enacting the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 which clarifies the responsibilities of fund trustees and strengthens the powers of the industry regulator, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, ISC;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The long title of this legislation says that it is a bill to amend the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Act 1991 and for related purposes. In view of the fact that the substance of the legislation is entirely of a regulatory nature, I intend to spend my time more effectively talking about the `for related purposes' aspect, which enables me to discuss the government's superannuation policy in a much wider context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) has just told us, the sad reality is that the greatest shortcoming for more than a decade in Labor's economic and social strategy has been Australia's chronic lack of national savings. This has been a major constraint on our economic growth, together with a failure to fully integrate our tax and social security systems with superannuation and savings policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, economic consultant Dr Vince FitzGerald, who was used by the government for an excellent report on national savings, said some two years ago that Australia's savings had fallen to its lowest level this century, excluding the Depression and both world wars. For most of the post-war period, national savings were around 23 per cent of GDP. By 1991-92, this figure had fallen to 16 per cent and has risen very slightly since then. Consequently, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will appreciate that, while the government is on the right track in terms of the need for superannuation policy, one has to question in detail whether the overall strategy will establish the parameters for the program which they want to implement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The week before last the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) launched a $12.5 million taxpayer-funded education program in an attempt to win widespread public support for the government's superannuation strategy. While there is general support&mdash;and the opposition accepts this&mdash;for the concept of superannuation, in principle, as a method for long-term saving, under Labor it is perfectly clear that consumer confidence in superannuation remains low. That is the reason we have this taxpayer funded program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last November a study conducted by the Australian Consumers Council found that 50 per cent of those surveyed believed superannuation was a poor investment. In the same month the Australian Taxation Office released the first results of its survey into superannuation. The survey found that young people between 18 and 25 believe it is too early to be involved in superannuation; that those between 25 and 45 believe they have too many other financial commitments; and that those aged between 45 and 55 believe it is too late to start saving for retirement. So it is very much a case of `not in my backyard'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several months later, ASSIRT investment research warned that confidence in superannuation could soon fall to crisis levels, with the results of its March 1995 survey showing a seven per cent fall in the number of people who believe that superannuation is a good investment. What were the reasons for this? Among others, respondents said that poor investment returns, lack of perceived tax benefits, the complexity of the superannuation system resulting from the numerous changes&mdash;some 2,000 that I have been able to identify&mdash;as well as tax law changes were largely to blame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation is also perceived as being too rigid as a personal savings vehicle as it locks up savings before retirement age and is not available as security for personal borrowings. In addition, contributors are frustrated by the lack of control over their funds, feeling that their financial destiny is entirely in the hands of the government and the finance industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These surveys suggest that confidence will improve only if superannuation is made more simple, predictable and relevant to the medium-term and long-term needs of contributors. There is also a need to guarantee that the pension will continue to be available to those who qualify. I have put it on record on a number of occasions that the opposition is totally committed to the existing social security arrangements, and people who qualify for the pension will continue to receive it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the education program is obviously important&mdash;although whether it will achieve the outcome remains to be seen&mdash;it should not be seen as an excuse for failing to make the obvious reforms that consumers want. We have a sceptical community and, in that community, superannuation must be promoted honestly and without resorting to political hyperbole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, we have a Prime Minister who is well known for his weakness in that particular area. His statement on the day on which he made the launch, among other things, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To give an example, someone on an average weekly earnings now&mdash;that's someone on about $32-33,000&mdash;when they retire, they will retire on a lump sum just under half a million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA>Such generous end benefits depend on critical assumptions not least of which are the age of contributors, the period for which they will be making those contributions, the level of contributions, whether they have been fully funded, whether they have been covered by adequate level of employment and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Mr Keating's package assumes a steady rate of CPI growth of three per cent, wages growth of four per cent and a generous fund earnings rate of seven per cent. Any variation in those factors will mean that achieving a sum total of half a million dollars as a payout, as suggested by the Prime Minister, in real rather than nominal terms, will be exceedingly difficult. But unfortunately, as I said, resorting to hyperbole, he has given us the distinct impression that anybody even in the work force today, because of the government's SGC arrangements, will qualify for such a payout. That is patently absurd and patently untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, according to the Treasury's own estimates, to achieve that sum a contributor would have to enter the work force in seven years time at the age of 25 when the government superannuation scheme is fully implemented, and work full time on average wages for at least 40 years beyond the year 2002. It is clear that today's workers cannot expect to have a part of, much less own, the Prime Minister's very heavily fertilised money tree, which has become the symbol of this entire program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it very sad&mdash;and I am already receiving mail and complaints from constituents on this matter&mdash;that the whole tenor of the advertising program is based on statements such as `Provided you put money into the fund you will get these benefits; they are guaranteed'. Sadly, that is not true. They are not guaranteed; they are not covered by the Banking Act. Superannuation law is quite separate from the banking law, and the benefits are not guaranteed by the Commonwealth. That is a point which has to be quite clearly understood but it is obviously not the point the government wants people to know about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that if you dissect the community in terms of winners and losers on this exercise, you do not get the response that the Prime Minister would like us to see. Many women will be unlikely to receive a benefit anywhere near the amount touted by the Prime Minister, given that their average annual income is about half that of men and many women spend longer periods out of the work force. On average, women spend just 17 years in paid employment compared with 39 years for men, although it is clear that that is now in the process of changing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just women. For example, under the compulsory superannuation scheme no worker in their late 40s who is on average weekly earnings could possibly accumulate sufficient superannuation savings to keep them when they are in retirement. Even someone aged 50 and earning $80,000 a year, which is well above the pension rate, would have to save at least 20 per cent of their salary to accumulate $490,000, in today's dollars, by age 65. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even Accord Mark VIII&mdash;this grand, shining emblem of industrial relations progress under Labor&mdash;shows that a worker on the lowest award rate, a worker who is receiving the Accord safety net pay increases, would in the year 1998 be $8.25 a week worse off in real terms by the end of the Accord while employees not covered by awards would simply miss out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is that? It is because, unlike employer contributions which are mandated in law, employee contributions under the government's arrangements are entirely in the hands of the Industrial Relations Commission and the process of the award negotiations. If those people are not under awards then the big question is whether they are covered for superannuation, and it would appear that the answer is no. Consequently, for a growing proportion of the work force, Mr Keating's grand design of a $500,000 retirement benefit is as fanciful today as Mr Hawke's promise that after 1990 no Australian child would live in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also make the point clearly here that, when the Treasurer (Mr Willis) spoke with me at a conference put on by ASFA last Thursday, he made the allegation that, under coalition policies, people would be considerably less well off in superannuation than they are under this proposal. I want to reiterate what was said on that day by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard); that is, no Australian worker will be `worse off' under coalition policy than they are under the current government's policy on superannuation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to the question of industrial relations impact. No-one doubts that the SGC payments and employee superannuation contributions will have significant implications for the industrial relations system of this country. I have noted previously that low paid workers will be worse off. In an attempt to play down this apparently unforeseen effect of the Accord Mark VIII, Treasurer Willis has advanced the argument that superannuation contributions represent ordinary savings, which we all know is simply not correct. He says that these are savings that have been put aside. That is not an adequate explanation for the superannuation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 20 July last his colleague, the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns), effectively conceded this point when he said that compulsory contributions are a reallocation between present and future earnings. Consequently, low paid workers will actually receive less in the hand as a result of the Accord. He went on to say that the 1997 review of awards by the AIRC, which is conveniently timed to be in the same year as the introduction of this process, will ensure that no employee will be out of pocket as a result of superannuation contributions. If that is true, then the only conclusion that can be drawn is that employers will be paying more. We know that is precisely the reason why the mandatory element does not cover employees; it only covers employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government compensates employees for their three per cent superannuation contributions by pay increases through the award system, surely it follows that there will be a premium for those workers who remain in the system and belong to a union. Clearly, there will be a disincentive to move to a more flexible, high wage, high productivity enterprise agreement system involving employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consideration should therefore be given to the status of non-unionists in regard to the selection of trustees for industry funds where it is normally the prerogative of the employer organisations, the dominant union or the ACTU. But, in many cases, union membership is a minority interest. Therefore, while trustees are by law responsible for safeguarding the interests of all contributors, there is clearly a problem here when non-unionists, often in a majority, may not be adequately included in the process of selecting who their trustees should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been coalition policy to support superannuation payments made by both employers and employees. While employer contributions are identified in legislation, employee contributions have been left entirely in the hands of the AIRC. The question therefore is whether that is an adequate situation for a government that claims that it wants to have 90-plus per cent of the work force covered by the system. Clearly, this is a weakness which has not been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer now to some of the questions about savings strategy objectives. Clearly, our national savings strategy must have twin objectives: to reduce dependence on social security and the age pension&mdash;thus increasing public savings&mdash;and, at the same time, to encourage private savings. On that point, the government and the opposition are as one. But the attainment of these objectives must take into account their impact on the disposable income of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time as Australian workers face reduced disposable incomes because of a compulsory superannuation package, if the predictions about inflationary trends are correct they will also face rises in interest rates and home mortgages while real wages will remain virtually stagnant. In fact, a mortgage rate of 10.5 per cent today has the same impact as a rate of 16 per cent had on the take-home pay of workers in the late 1980s. Clearly, that is going to increase pressure for additional credit just to maintain standards of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government policy has also designated superannuation as a tax preferred investment over all other forms of saving: banks, building societies, credit unions and so forth. There is a clear danger in that. Much of the new savings which are now being compulsorily channelled into superannuation are, effectively, simply a switch between normal non-superannuation savings and superannuation savings. The latter are expected to increase to $2,408.5 billion dollars or 64 per cent of GDP by the year 2030 while, at the same time&mdash;and clearly as a result of that&mdash;bank and NBFI deposits are expected to fall. This will obviously have quite serious economic and social consequences, not to mention the realities of the problem of having a tilted playing field for investments on the one side and for drawing on savings on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made the following point in a discussion paper I gave to LIFA, in which I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The future direction of superannuation and national savings strategy must take into account the significant lifestyle changes occurring in our society . . . Given the changing social paradigm the consumer will expect a long-term savings strategy to include opportunities for medium term savings.</PARA>
<PARA>This is in line with recommendations of Dr FitzGerald in his report on national savings released in June 1993. Regrettably, the government has done nothing at all to address this question of intermediate savings strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, ACOSS and consumer organisations have rightly criticised the government's savings policy because they claim that it will significantly reduce the take-home pay of low income earners. The government's response is to say, `Nonsense! We are starting by having a one per cent compulsory employee contribution rate which will work up to three per cent.' What they are not saying, of course, is that the hidden agenda is that ultimately the employer will have to pay the lot. That is the hidden agenda which the government does not want to talk to us about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, however, there is a real risk that the level of income of low income workers is going to actually fall at a time when many of them need it most: the family formation period when they are paying off mortgages and so forth. It would be far more equitable if low and medium income earners were offered access to a flexible intermediate savings vehicle which would have some tax advantages linked to savings periods of, say, five to 10 years. That would give them the ability to save when they were able to save and, at the same time, to have access to at least part of those savings to meet those crisis issues of life which we all have to face. That ability is totally locked in, in a situation where all your available savings are forced into a long-term savings arrangement such as superannuation is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An inevitable outcome of the government's policy of introducing the three per cent compulsory employee contribution from 1997, together with the government co-payment of up to $1,000&mdash;and I must emphasise that that is totally unfunded and that we have now been told by the Treasurer that there will be no legislation for it before the next election, so that we are once again in the interesting situation we were in before the last&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which also may not happen. Are we seriously going to believe this government is able to deliver on what is clearly a totally unfunded commitment? To date, five or six per cent of employer contributions have been left largely in the hands of industry fund trustees to invest through fund managers, and employees have felt divorced from the decision making process, which they tend to see as being the responsibility of the employer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But after 1997 employees will become well aware of their reduced take-home pay and, as a result, there will undoubtedly be an increased interest in the investment outcome of individual funds. Any adverse performance, such as we have seen in recent times, will no doubt bring with it a considerable consumer backlash, especially as we are talking about a compulsory system. The future for fund managers in that environment will be further complicated by the fact that by the year 2002 the federal government will have contributed at least $4.5 billion, according to the last budget, directly into superannuation. I am aware of no other area of fiscal responsibility where the government has ever injected so much taxpayer money back into the system as a means of supplementing savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that by the next decade the level of direct government support to superannuation will be in the vicinity of $10 billion annually. How does that place it in relation to other major areas of expenditure? It is significant. For defence, $10.8 billion is projected for the 1998-99 financial year, and for education, $11.9 billion is projected over the same period. In other words, for the first time ever you are going to have this vast quantum, some $10 billion, going into superannuation, thereby competing in the public's mind with some of the very major areas of government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By any yardstick that commitment is substantial, and it is going to loom as a very large target. Over 40 years it will cost in excess of $400 billion, but by the year 2035, according to the retirement income modelling task force, employer SGC and co-contributions will still only reduce pension outlays by 0.3 to 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product&mdash;about $1.7 billion in real terms. And for that we are paying out $10 billion a year. That is the actuarial calculation which I urge the government to consider very seriously indeed: the cost-benefit relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what will be the political impact? I think it is going to come in two directions. Firstly, there will be a growing number of parliamentarians who will start questioning whether the rate of return is justified. They will undoubtedly voice the concerns of their electorate. Secondly, the argument that the government should set rules for investment may become even more shrill. Almost every time you have a debate on superannuation in this chamber, members of the government stand up and say that superannuation money should be directed into national projects, into infrastructure investment, et cetera. The Treasurer then rushes around telling everybody, `No, no, it is not true. We are not going to interfere. It is entirely in the hands of the trustees and the fund managers. It is not the role of government.' The point I am making is that, as this quantum of money grows, the political imperative for governments to interfere in the process is obviously going to grow, and the evidence is quite clearly there in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that these twin pressures will make asset management even more hazardous than it is at present. We see that the portfolio theory for asset allocation takes account of historical trends in investment. However, increased political interest in the outcomes could well minimise the ability of managers to take the correct technical decisions. And we have seen how often that has happened in the past in other areas of government interference. Performance in the various categories for investment has varied historically. During the 1950s and the 1960s, we saw a decade and more which appeared to be an unending growth cycle. This may well happen again in the next decade. I do not know, you do not know; none of us does. But there is an equal risk that in the same period we may actually see an underperformance in economic terms or certainly in fiscal management terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the market for investment becomes more internationalised&mdash;and we now see vast sums of money passing hither and thither on a 24-hour basis&mdash;the attraction for Australian fund managers to look offshore for investment potential is obviously going to grow. After all, we are talking about two trillion dollars in the system&mdash;a vast amount of money. The question which has to be asked is: is the Australian economy going to be sufficiently broad and flexible enough to be able to absorb a large component of that money, or will the money have to go offshore as a means of guaranteeing the best possible return?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the reasons why the opposition believes that a more sophisticated and detailed policy of privatisation is significant in this particular area. To take one example, if Telstra were sold completely, it could realise between $20 billion and $30 billion, but still retain a majority Australian ownership. Under a coalition government there would not be a shambles like we have had with Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangement was that the majority of the funds were to remain Australian yet, a month or so after the closure of the initial allocation of shares, nobody seems to know who owns what. However, there is a very strong fear that government policy has been breached and that a majority of Qantas shares may be now owned by foreigners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, while we in the coalition are committed to a policy of privatisation, we believe that that is going to open up for fund managers a new range of potential investment opportunities which are clearly not available to the Australian market at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is unanimous agreement between both parties on the question of the need for increased domestic savings in Australia as an essential component for economic growth. A quantum jump in our standard of living cannot be achieved unless foreign debt is drastically eased through, among other things, a major increase in net domestic savings. The household savings ratio in Australia is the lowest ever recorded. That is the result of Labor's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the recent evidence that household debt levels have increased from 45 per cent to 65 per cent of disposable income over the last decade is clearly a matter of considerable seriousness. Increased domestic debt can only be justified provided the equity value in home prices continues to rise side by side with standards of living. But what do we see? The reality is that home equity values are actually falling and our standard of living is clearly stagnating. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, Australia has not succeeded in designing a methodology for financing growth, especially for small and medium enterprises. This sector will produce most job growth and it will also provide the entrepreneurial enterprise from which innovations should ultimately emerge. A case in point is the company Netscape in the United States. It is a small company that in 16 months grew in assets from $4.1 million to between $3 billion and $4 billion, all on the strength of its software innovations and access to the Internet. While the size and depth of the United States market is clearly different to Australia's, nevertheless we must do much better to encourage innovation and to turn innovative ideas into marketable opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to credit at a price that employers can afford is fundamental to our economic health. That is the one thing that this government has ultimately failed to do. Unless we can successfully build our economy using more of our own capital for import replacement and export industries, it is obvious that present government policy will simply be a recipe for much higher unemployment at the next cyclical downturn, which all members know will come as sure as day follows night in the progression of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, building up those SMEs which I referred to is essential at this time. We have opportunities in our own region, especially for high-tech developments in Asia, but these opportunities will only remain open while we have technological and comparative cost advantages, and access to finance is absolutely critical. It is probably going to take 10 years to get those companies up and running, but one of the issues which has to be raised is what the role of superannuation savings will be&mdash;which, as I said, are long-term savings, which, by definition, are ideal for that type of investment. It is necessary to make sure that fund managers are encouraged to put aside at least part of their funding to ensure that good ideas and young Australian companies in the developmental stages get the opportunities which they clearly need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia is to enter into a developmental phase of sustained growth which has more substance than that just suggested by Mr Keating's five minutes of economic sunshine, it is obvious that we have to reduce significantly our exposure to overseas debt and further imbalances in our current account. We will need to see higher real growth rates on investments but that is not going to be easy in a low inflationary environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, superannuation funds, by their very nature, are long term. They are attractive sources for longer term infrastructure funding. They also provide an opportunity for a matching of long-term assets with liabilities but, regrettably, that is another thing which has not been effectively one of our strengths for much of the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, while we are opening up new avenues for infrastructure financing, we want to be able to give our fund managers the opportunities to be able to look into those sources as an alternative to having to go overseas. If our capital has to migrate overseas in the quantities which have been suggested&mdash;as high as 40 per cent of the total quantum of funds available&mdash;then that is a clear demonstration of the failure of this Labor government to be able to have an investment policy which has been able to generate the growth and which, in turn, creates the opportunities for further investment in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians do not mind compulsory saving providing they can see some results for it, providing they can see jobs for their children, providing they can see economic growth and providing they can see a future for the citizens of this great country.

But let me also answer the question as to why those changes have been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Bradfield, a student of this area, knows, for example, that before 1984, when we came into government, less than 40 per cent of all the wage and salary earners in Australia were covered by superannuation. Who were they? Not the wage plug in my electorate, let me assure you. The wealthy, the high-income people: they were the people who were included in that 40 per cent. They were male, wealthy, high-income people, because fewer than 25 per cent of women in employment in 1983 were covered by superannuation.

He claimed that one of the assertions we had made, that in certain circumstances a person entering the work force now would retire with an accumulated superannuation benefit equal to half a million dollars, would depend on assumptions. Yes, of course it depends on assumptions. But those assumptions are realistic, those assumptions are credible and those assumptions are achievable. He said they were not.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you know that spokesmen and women for the opposition at the time of the last election said that another forecast of this government was fanciful. That was that we would create during the term of this parliament 500,000 new jobs. Isn't it interesting that the reference from the member of Bradfield was to $500,000? The reference that I am taking note of now refers to our undertaking to seek to create 500,000 new jobs during the term of this parliament. They said that was fanciful.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said there was a lot of political rhetoric in what the member for Bradfield had to say, and those were a few examples.

The implication that the member for Bradfield attempted to build into that was that, as a result of it being unfunded, there was some doubt about whether the government could deliver. Well, old age pensions are unfunded. That is not unusual in the public sector; it is not unusual at all. We know that next year they will be paid by next year's revenue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My experience leads me to believe that that means existing benefits would be maintained&mdash;but frozen. If they are frozen, as I believe they will be if the coalition comes into government&mdash;there is no question in my mind about that&mdash;by the time a 25-year-old now on average weekly earnings in today's dollar terms retires, the superannuation guarantee at present levels will have cost him or her between $230,000 and $260,000 in accumulated superannuation benefit. I question whether those 25-year-olds going into the work force on average weekly earnings would be prepared to take that risk. Within a relatively short period of time, they are going to be asked to make that judgment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Wentworth interjects that one of the points I just made is not true. I do not know that it is not true. I referred to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition said in his budget reply that the coalition government would preserve existing retirement benefits. I said I thought that that means they would be frozen. If there is any doubt about that, as the interjection suggests there is, let me tell you something that is true&mdash;as true as I stand here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the present Leader of the Opposition became Treasurer to Malcolm Fraser, one of the first steps he took was to abandon the indexation of age pensions that we had put into place. I know that the person who interjected is a man of goodwill. I do not believe that he wants to see any penalties visited upon people in their retirement. If that is true&mdash;and he is shaking his head in confirmation&mdash;he should be with me over here. I invite him, and I would welcome him. It may well be that in the fullness of time, as we have an opportunity to see how these things work out, he may well choose to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two essential elements in our approach to superannuation. The first element is retirement security. The government has also emphasised&mdash;as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;that, in connection with retirement security, there are three essential components for us. We have guaranteed to maintain the age pension. That is the basic safety net. No-one, as far as we are concerned, falls through that. In addition to that, we have the compulsory savings element, which now consists of the superannuation guarantee and the minimum employee contribution. As well as that, we have the voluntary element of superannuation, which is encouraged by substantial tax concessions&mdash;still provided by government&mdash;and the government's matching payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those three components, as far as we are concerned, are the three pillars of our commitment to retirement benefits and to the security of Australian men and women when they reach retirement age. I want to see a bipartisan approach and a commitment from the opposition that they will endorse that approach and that they will not just freeze existing benefits if&mdash;if, if, if!&mdash;they come into government, but will continue our plan, our program and our strategy to ensure that the benefits for Australians in retirement will continue to grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make this point as clearly and as forcefully as I can. The Australian community&mdash;whatever their reservations from time to time about the Labor Party and about the labour movement and about Labor governments, governments to which I am absolutely committed&mdash;know that what I say is true. If they are seeking from any political movement in Australia and from any government a firm, positive, honest commitment to security in their retirement, they will look to this government, to this party and to this movement and they will look nowhere else. They know that as well as I do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element in our approach to superannuation is national savings, and reference has been made to the fact that Dr Vince FitzGerald, in his report in 1993, referred to the positive deficiency in the level of savings in Australia. Yes, there is a deficiency, and that deficiency in savings is critical in relation to financing the type of investment that we need to be undertaking in Australia. It is also critical to the current account deficit because, if people are not saving, they are buying; and, if they are buying, they are very often buying goods from overseas and that, of course, contributes towards the current account deficit. So we need to build national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What better way to do it than to build in the process of encouraging, assisting and enabling people to provide for their own retirement? Not only that, but we have said to them, `With those employee contributions that are being made, the government will match every dollar you put in.' As a result of that, by early in the next century, the equivalent of 15 per cent of people's income will be going in to provide for their retirement. Some people say it is nine per cent from employers, but that is not correct: six per cent will come from employers, another six per cent will come from employees, and the balance of three per cent will come from the government's matching commitment, making a total of 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that some people had claimed that the employers would be contributing nine per cent, but they will be doing nothing of the kind. The first three per cent that came into existence in 1985 was a trade-off. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will remember that this government said to the ACTU and to the trade union movement, `As a result of productivity gains, employees&mdash;wage and salary earners&mdash;in Australia are entitled to a three per cent increase in their wages and salaries. Do you want that in your pocket to take home, or do you want us to arrange to put that three per cent into superannuation for you?' To their credit, the ACTU and the trade union movement said, `Put it into super.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition and employers now claim that was the employers' three per cent. No, it was not. It has been suggested that with the progressive increase there will be a contribution from employers equal to six per cent. That will then match the six per cent from employees and the three per cent matching from government. To a very large extent, that is going to assist to overcome that deficiency in savings as a result of that. In fact, it is estimated that by the turn of the century it will have increased savings by two per cent of GDP. That will mean that, by the year 2006, each year savings will be three per cent of GDP greater than they would otherwise have been. By the year 2021 that will be four per cent of GDP. I think our GDP is about $450 billion. Translated into today's dollars, that means that we will have increased national savings by the year 2021 by an amount of $18 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of things I would like to say. This is a fascinating area. The thing that I want to emphasise is that what this government has done has been to integrate its approach to retirement income, to superannuation, with the whole question of national savings, the impact that that has on the capacity of this nation to invest and the effect that it has as well on the current account deficit. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill amends the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Act 1991, the principal act, to make a minor amendment to the method of calculation of the late lodgment amount. A late lodgment amount can become payable under the principal act if a superannuation entity is late in lodging an annual return. The amendments to subsection 6(2) of the levy act will mean that a late lodgment amount will now arise for each calendar month which begins after the required return lodgment day and before the day on which the return is actually lodged. The late lodgment amount forms a component of the superannuation supervisory levy which all superannuation entities are required to pay to cover the cost of the prudential supervision of the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will ensure consistency with the method of calculating the late payment penalty under subsection 15DC(2) of the Superannuation Entities Taxation Act 1987. That subsection, incidentally, is proposed to be amended by the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) of 1995, which is due to be debated some time in the not too distant future. This amendment only applies in relation to returns lodged for the 1994-95 year of income or a later year of income. The changes are not, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) has explained, expected to have any overall impact on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is essentially a housekeeping bill and it was introduced into the House on 28 June. This bill, although rather thin in terms of pages, does provide us with an opportunity to discuss matters relating to the mismanagement of superannuation policy under this government. I stated in speaking on one of the seemingly interminable bills in relation to superannuation earlier this year that a genuine retirement income strategy requires a stable and predictable environment, security, incentives to encourage financial independence, better integration of the tax and social security systems and the guarantee of a government safety net. Of these, Labor has most notably and totally failed to provide so far for a stable and predictable environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A survey undertaken by Brian Sweeney and Associates earlier this year on behalf of the government tried to ascertain the level of support and understanding of the superannuation system. The result was not good for the government. Almost half of those surveyed had only slight or no understanding of superannuation. This was particularly the case amongst women, students and the unemployed. The proportion with a reasonable understanding had also fallen from just over 60 per cent to just over 50 per cent since the last survey was conducted in 1992. So they are going backwards. Most misunderstandings resulted from the constant changes to the rules in government policies, the language used, taxation issues and how superannuation worked as a system for retirement income. Interestingly, 40 per cent thought they were getting poor returns for their money and over 70 per cent of respondents wanted more control over how super funds invested their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Anne Lampe, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 5 August, made some interesting observations on the superannuation system. She wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble with superannuation is that it is a moving feast that is almost impossible to get a grip on because it is changing too quickly. There have been hundreds of significant and smaller changes to the super landscape since 1983 when the 15 per cent lump sum tax was first introduced, followed by further taxes on investment, reduction of tax concessions and four or five changes to maximum benefit limits. The only way people are going to understand how the super system works is for the Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the Opposition, for that matter&mdash;to leave it alone for a while and let the rules sink in.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to write:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system is so complex that two weeks ago the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations (AFCO) produced a 200-page guide designed to explain superannuation to fund trustees and community workers, and has been rushed with requests for copies at $75 apiece.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Lampe concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government left the current super framework alone there would be no need to spend $12 million to explain it. If stability is not achieved in the super field the $12 million is as good as poured down the drain.</PARA>
<PARA>That is it in a comparative nutshell. How correct are her observations. But the real reason for Labor's super sell at the moment is the coming election. There should be no doubt about that. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is desperate to sell his superannuation initiative. He has been constantly talking up the impact of the superannuation changes on the supposed average worker, who earns $33,000 per annum and will receive a pay-out of $462,000. What goes unsaid in this exercise is that the example so fondly given by the Prime Minister only applies to someone who is 18 years of age today, begins full-time employment in the year 2002 and retires in 2042. George Megalogenis wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>on 12 August:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not necessarily a bad message for the Government to be selling to voters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it doesn't sit well with Keating's promise, repeated again this week, of a $462,000 SGC bonanza for a worker on average earnings.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The job for Keating is to sell the benefits of the policy without falling into the hyperbole that tends to dog him when he talks on economic policy.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister is deliberately setting the scene to dupe those who are currently in the work force about their future retirement income. He is fully aware that the average voter is not familiar with the fine print of his half a million dollars SGC example. Even worse, he does not care if the population are sold a dummy, so long as they vote for his party at the next election. The Prime Minister is yet again positioning himself as the great deceiver of the true believers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treasury figures present a very different image from the gloss presented by our increasingly desperate Prime Minister. These figures show that the first baby boomers who retire under the SGC will still be poor enough to receive the age pension at retirement age&mdash;unless, of course, they buy additional superannuation. In the same terms, those who retire in the next 20 or 30 years will still have to rely on a pension, if only a part pension. The fact remains that even for the average person entering the labour market in 2002 superannuation will not deliver the promised retirement incomes. Take the simple fact that 70 per cent of workers earn less than the $33,000 average income per annum. They are therefore not going to receive the almost half a million dollars figure being touted by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Vince FitzGerald has also been critical of the Prime Minister's focus on the $462,000 figure. The Prime Minister's assumption also neglects some realities inherent in our labour markets. Australia's work patterns are constantly changing. Workers do not stay in the same job their entire lives, nor do they necessarily stay in the same industries. Many&mdash;too many, some would say&mdash;suffer periods of redundancy and unemployment. In fact, something like eight per cent of the work force is currently unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The days of starting a job with John Smith and Co. Ltd and working there until you retire are long gone. The Prime Minister's example is a throwback to the work patterns of 30 years ago, or even the age of the FJ Holden. He is living in the past. It explains why the government has been unable to adequately resolve the problems associated with portability. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women, on the whole, will not benefit from compulsory superannuation charges to the same extent as men. Women continue to have broken work patterns due to their taking time out of the work force to bear and to raise children. They are also more concentrated in part-time, casual and temporary work. Treasury has estimated that a woman with a broken work pattern, or someone on less than average wages, could receive as little as $50,000 in retirement from the superannuation guarantee charge system.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a long way short of the Prime Minister's half a million dollars boast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the only example of the government's exaggeration of the benefits of superannuation, as it now is. The Prime Minister has been travelling around the nation, telling all who will listen that the SGC will eventually result in an accumulation of $2 trillion in superannuation funds&mdash;up from $40 billion a decade ago and $180 billion this year. Dr FitzGerald had this to say about that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is always prone to hype which is unfortunate&mdash;like this $2 trillion stupidity, which makes what are substantial changes sound astronomical, when substantial is good enough.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr FitzGerald pointed out that this growth does not look so brilliant after accounting for inflation and the growth of national income. This reduces the increase to approximately twofold. Handsome enough in itself; the Prime Minister does not need to exaggerate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite simply, things are not as great as the government would have us believe. In light of the survey findings I referred to earlier, it is perhaps not surprising that the government is now going to spend $12.5 million on an advertising campaign to educate Australians on how the system works. This campaign is, however, a complete waste of taxpayers' money. The superannuation system has several major problems which need to be fixed before any major campaign begins. Unfortunately, that campaign has already begun. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Issues which need to be resolved beforehand involve portability, choice, competition, and taxes, fees and charges. I acknowledge that the industry has adopted a voluntary protocol covering portability. This has apparently reduced the amount of paperwork involved in rolling over super accounts, yet it has not resolved the issue of severe penalties applying when funds are rolled over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been approached by public servants who are currently working for the Water Authority of Western Australia but are now moving outside the public sector into the employ of companies winning what are quaintly described as outsourcing contracts. These public servants want to roll over their superannuation to their own funds, yet they will be penalised 1.75 per cent for every year before the age of 55. A 30-year-old will therefore be penalised with the loss of 44 per cent of his or her accumulated superannuation. That is a disgrace. </PARA>

As a government, we can be very proud of our record on superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us addresses a number of issues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The late lodgment amount becomes payable only if a superannuant lodges a late return. Quite honestly, late lodgment should not happen, but when it does there needs to be an appropriate penalty.

How those payments are actually made is something I have raised from time to time and something my constituents have raised with me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to digress a bit and respond to some members opposite by talking about the record of this government on superannuation. Since coming to office in 1983, this Labor government has radically transformed retirement savings through the creation of comprehensive national superannuation schemes. In the long term, that will increase retirement incomes and national savings. Clearly, if you provide for your own retirement through superannuation, it will improve your lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I always wonder why the opposition has continually tried to attack the government's belief in the need for superannuation. Superannuation had been lacking in this country for many years, and our superannuation record is something that this government can be proud of. The opposition, instead of trying to undermine the benefits of superannuation, should be making some constructive contribution to the debate, but I have yet to see that from any opposition member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition talks about their policies in this area, but do they have any policies? This area is yet another vacuum when it comes to opposition policies. Superannuation is probably one of the most important things needed when people are preparing for their retirement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to 1983, when those opposite were in government, superannuation was the preserve of managers, some public sector workers and some white-collar workers in the private sector. I always wondered why it was never extended to the rest of the work force&mdash;obviously, there were real motives for that. The vast majority of Australian workers did not have access to superannuation to supplement their retirement incomes. This government, in pursuit of a fair and equitable retirement income policy for all Australians, has to a large extent remedied that situation through a number of key policy initiatives. It is important to have key policy initiatives. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), can think about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1985 accord with the ACTU played a pivotal role in the superannuation process, with a universal three per cent employer provided superannuation benefit in lieu of an equivalent productivity based general wage rise. We need to remind people that the workers themselves contributed that three per cent in 1985. The award based superannuation system, which emanated from the subsequent national wage case in 1986, saw access to superannuation extended from a base of 39 per cent of employees in 1983 to 72 per cent by July 1991. That is a tremendous record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is really quite disgraceful that those opposite criticise the trade union movement in relation to superannuation because, without the support and cooperation of the trade union movement, we would not have the superannuation system for the Australian work force that we have today. The trade union movement is extremely important and its contribution should be acknowledged today&mdash;not only by those on this side of the House but also by those opposite. Without that cooperation and without the spirit and interest of the working men and women of this nation, we would not have achieved the superannuation goals that we have so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of criticising the trade union movement, once again the opposition would be better off looking very supportively at the role that it has played.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When it comes to the trade union movement, I suppose the opposition has one policy&mdash;to be in complete opposition with the trade union movement no matter what they do instead of being a little cooperative with them. Getting back to the main subject of superannuation: to supplement the development of award superannuation, the government in the 1991 budget introduced the superannuation guarantee to further extend the coverage of superannuation for employees and to ensure compliance amongst employers in meeting their superannuation obligations to their employees. That is extremely important as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combination of award superannuation and the superannuation guarantee had increased coverage to more than 90 per cent of the Australian work force as of August 1995. Once again, that is another tremendous record that Australians can be proud of. By the year 2002, under the superannuation guarantee schedule of rates, workers will receive employer superannuation support equivalent to nine per cent of their salary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members opposite that when they last held office at the federal level, only 39 per cent of the work force was covered by superannuation. Now we are talking about taking that figure up to 90 per cent. I think you will all agree that this is a damning indictment of the opposition's retirement income policy at that time. They did have a policy at that time, albeit a very bad one. But, clearly, it did not require the powers of Nostradamus to see the potential of superannuation in the future direction of retirement income policy in Australia. It needed to be addressed a long time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government's hard work in the area of superannuation has ensured that a whole new generation of Australians has access to a superannuation base which will go a long way to ensuring financial independence when they enter retirement. That financial independence is important for a good retirement income policy. However, ensuring access to superannuation is only half the issue. The government has also legislated to ensure that superannuation funds, in which workers have invested their hard earned money, are investing their funds in a prudentially sound manner. Of course, that comes to the safety aspect of superannuation funds and that is important as well as far as the employees are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, a host of legislation, including the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Act 1991, the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act, has been enacted to provide a sound regulatory framework for the operation of the superannuation industry into the 21st century. A very progressive approach!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this contest, the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1995, which is before the House today, will play its role in ensuring the prudential supervision superannuation of the superannuation industry remains sound. The minor amendments to the calculation of the late lodgment amount which are outlined in the bill are designed to ensure the superannuation entities lodge their annual returns under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, thus allowing costs associated with the prudential supervision of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the provisions put in place by the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 allow for the prudent management of certain superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts and for their supervision by the Insurance Superannuation Commission. The regulation of the superannuation industry under the Commonwealth's powers with respect to corporations or pensions ensures public confidence in the superannuation industry and has secured increased protection of superannuation savings. We need to remind people here today of that very aspect of the protection that superannuation savings actually provide, instead of the doom and gloom that those opposite often try to put forward to undermine the importance of superannuation savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enforcement powers that we legislated for in 1993 have ensured that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission can enforce the prudential requirements and obligations placed on funds and trustees under the act. I think most people would agree that the legislation has proved both efficient and effective in practice. The government's initiatives in the 1995 budget, as outlined in the budget paper `Saving for our future', build upon the sound retirement incomes policies we have in place and provide us with a comprehensive national savings plan for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1995-96 budget two specific initiatives were announced in terms of the superannuation component of the government's retirement incomes policy. From 1997, variations to awards will see the introduction of employee contributions to superannuation paid out of future wage rises. Contributions amounting to three per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings will be phased in over three years. This phasing-in period will reduce undue pressure on wages and costs and should see no discernible reduction in disposable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To complement the three per cent phased employer superannuation contributions, the government will match dollar for dollar employee contributions with direct payments to workers' superannuation accounts by paying the second round of the One Nation tax cuts in this form. The matching payments will be capped at three per cent of the average weekly ordinary time earnings and a means test will gradually withdraw support up to a salary in a range of up to $65,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the year 2000, it is estimated that the government will be paying around $4.5 billion per year into the superannuation accounts of workers. This matching government contribution is specifically targeted at low and middle income earners who have traditionally included a significant proportion of women. Indeed, prior to 1983, only 24 per cent of workers covered by superannuation were women. Government policies have seen that figure continue to rise dramatically to a point where 85 per cent are now covered by superannuation&mdash;still short, of course, of the national average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The means testing of individual income instead of family income in terms of the government's superannuation contribution will provide many working women with a further incentive to save in their own right. This initiative builds upon previous government policy initiatives to extend superannuation coverage to women, which have included superannuation contributions being fully vested and preserved so the accumulated benefits will not be lost if a woman leaves her job for any reason; the relaxation of occupational linkage requirements, which allows women and men to pay superannuation contributions up to two years after stopping work or seven years where they are on leave for the purpose of raising a family; and a reduction in the number of hours which must be worked in any week from 20 to 10 hours before workers are eligible to contribute to superannuation. They are all very positive steps in recognising the role that women play in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As pointed out by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) last week in an address to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the government's matching contributions will ensure significantly higher incomes in retirement for ordinary workers&mdash;the bulk of the workers in this nation. Indeed, during the first few decades of the next century, the majority of workers&mdash;that is, those with incomes below average weekly earnings&mdash;will progressively move to a situation where their retirement income will be no less than their pre-retirement income when the age pension is combined with the income stream derived from superannuation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Treasurer rightly points out, this represents a dramatic change in after retirement living standards for many wage earners who would have previously had only the age pension in retirement. Once again, in preparing for retirement and in having a decent incomes retirement policy, a lot of these things will improve people's retirement incomes and hence their quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's emphasis upon superannuation as a retirement income policy for the future is of course predicated upon the age pension supplementary superannuation payments in retirement. The government, unlike the opposition, is committed to maintaining the age pension at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, buttressed by associated social security arrangements to ensure an adequate income safety net in retirement. Once again, that safety net is a feature of this government's social justice attitudes, and the same thing happens in the industrial relations area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition over past decades has failed to match Labor's commitment to ensuring that the age pension remains a viable income retirement supplement. Unfortunately, a vacuum at the headland of opposition policy gives us very little insight into the future direction of tory income retirement policy&mdash;or any other policy for that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, given the honourable member for Bennelong's decision to cease indexation of age pensions in a former life as Treasurer of a now widely discredited government, the direction of tory policy in the context of retirement income policy would seem quite clear. That is right. It is `Back to the future' time once again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of superannuation policy, it would seem that the opposition is still wedded to its pre-1993 election policy, which is designed to return to a situation where superannuation will once again become the preserve of the rich&mdash;and perhaps even senior public servants as well. The opposition's reliance upon tax concessions to encourage people to provide for their own retirement has not worked in the past in Australia, or anywhere else in the world. It is a lesson they should have learned many years ago. Obviously, they are slow learners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's New Right industrial relations agenda, which would see award conditions cut to a bare minimum, would certainly see the end of an award based superannuation system. That would destroy superannuation and all the work that has been done over recent years to providing a decent incomes policy for the people of Australia. Employers, always eager to reduce costs and increase profits, will no doubt take advantage of deregulated labour market conditions proposed by those opposite to stop paying superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees. That would ensure the obstruction of all the work that has been done in superannuation under this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, Mr Howard's agenda in terms of dismantling award based superannuation is well known. His statements about changing superannuation rules to ensure union officials do not control trust funds shows how out of touch he is with reality. Superannuation funds based upon occupations have a representative board made up of equal numbers of employer and employee representatives by law. Quite often we hear those opposite put all these furphies around that the unions have control of these superannuation funds. That representative board represents the members' interests in those particular superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Treasurer has already said in this matter, it is a sad comment on the alternative leader of this country that he has an ideological problem with workers having a say in how their own money is actually invested. The apparent determination of the opposition to return Australia to a pre-1983 superannuation system does not seem to recognise the benefits we as a nation can derive from increased savings through superannuation in the long term. Those increased savings, of course, are essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, being such a vast country with a relatively small population, has long suffered the problem of a low savings base. The economic implications of this have been profound. With a low savings base, we have had to borrow investment capital from overseas, which in turn has been reflected in the balance of payments and current account deficit figures. In this context, it is imperative that we build our own national savings pool from which the private sector can source investment capital which will drive economic growth in the long term. As pointed out in the FitzGerald report, superannuation will play a vital role in increasing Australia's national savings base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has since 1983 pursued a coordinated strategy on national savings which is built upon the increased retirement savings base already in place. Indeed, by the year 2020, the government's superannuation plan will add $18 billion each year to national savings. In this context, employees will be saving 15 per cent of their salaries through superannuation contributions, which results in higher retirement incomes in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contribution Australian workers will be making through superannuation, through national savings, is something this country needs. We need a sound superannuation policy in this country. We have got that, but we all need to work together. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It is those related purposes that some of the previous speakers have spoken to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) pointed out, superannuation has been perhaps the broadest issue before the House since I was elected to this House early in April of this year. It was interesting to listen to the tour de horizon given to us by my colleague the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and to see him followed by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who is a colleague of mine from the House Procedure Committee. It was a pleasure to hear the gracious tone with which he paid tribute to my colleague's efforts in this field of policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes I have, I would like to address one particular aspect of the superannuation debate which I believe falls within that phrase `related purposes'; that is, what I have detected in the debate about economic policy and superannuation's relationship to that. I detect a subtle change in that debate. The new sound is perhaps that of a fresh whipping boy being discovered by this government and its miserable fellow travellers in the media. The new villain, I am sad to announce, is the fund manager and, more particularly, the superannuation fund manager, who carries that frightful label, so redolent of Kelty and Keating venom, `the conservative superannuation fund manager'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their train of prosecutorial logic goes something like this: in Australia we suffer high unemployment and we suffer a chronic balance of payments deficit, so if we raise our savings rate we will, first, be able to fund more investment from domestic sources of capital and reduce our foreign debt and, second, presumably be able to supply more venture or developmental capital to small enterprises or to infrastructure projects in Australia which will in turn create more jobs and, of course, increase exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They say, according to this, that a large and unwieldy scheme to raise our national savings through superannuation&mdash;ignoring, of course, the potential of non-superannuation savings&mdash;will solve our problems entirely. This neat little equation begets what I think is a ridiculous notion: that market failure is responsible for the lack of finance going into small enterprises and into infrastructure projects; and that this market failure is somehow the fault of those dreadful conservative fund managers who are doing such villainous things as trying to protect our precious savings by investing in safe investments, such as blue chip equities or the bond market&mdash;although in the last two years the bond market has resembled a Quentin Tarantino movie in the sense that there has been blood everywhere. Last year, for example&mdash;and I will not seek the leave of the House to incorporate my table of the bond futures market&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FB6">Mr THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to hear it. I might seek to do it one day if I am in a poor mood. I might point out that early in 1994 the bond futures stood at 93; by the end of last year, they were down to 89.3, which took them well over 10 per cent. I am sure that many of the members of this House have had the same experience that I have had; that is, having constituents coming into the office to complain about the dreadful returns of their superannuation funds. That is probably largely what is behind some of the diminishing confidence that has appeared in the surveys conducted by various consumers organisations and the ASFA, to which the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) referred in his speech. But, putting that aside, I will perhaps leave Quentin Tarantino and other things for another time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I go back to the notion that somehow the market is failing to deliver finance to small enterprises which would, in turn, create the exports that we so dearly need to repair our awful trade balance. I say that is a ridiculous notion because, since the 1970s, for example, many of the policies of governments, especially governments of the Labor variety, have rendered Australian small enterprises as vastly less attractive investments than their alternatives, being those that are listed on the stock exchange or in the bond market&mdash;and certainly less attractive these days than investments you will find in our region but outside of Australia. New Zealand is a good example; the reforms which have taken place there have rendered investment in a small enterprise far more attractive than those in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plainly, it does not seem to have occurred to the Prime Minister or Mr Kelty that these days a small business, which is presumably the destination for much of this venture capital, can be wiped out almost instantly by a contrived unfair dismissal claim or a malevolent ruling from the Taxation Office. We have to ask: why would a sane investor risk his or her precious capital investing in a higher risk enterprise, operating in a political and regulatory environment that is just plainly anti-business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simply put, the problem is not really top down in that there is something wrong with the fund managers who are in charge of these enormous funds and who are making the decisions not to invest in these projects. The problem really is bottom up in that there is something flawed; something is inhibiting the returns that such a guardian of our capital would require before he or she would make such an investment. That is going back to first principles, which require of us that we ask two or three pertinent questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, we have to ask: is capital potentially available for these projects? I think the answer is plainly yes. In this borderless world, it is possible for an Eskimo in Alaska to invest in a venture capital fund which is dedicated to investments in Australia if he wants to. There is nothing to stop him going in to see a broker in Anchorage and making a decision, after studying the investment environment, and doing exactly that. That is the consequence of a borderless world. In the capital markets, more so than any other sector of our economy, resources will move from one part of the world to the other with a speed that has never been seen before. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What about the suicide note, Mrs Campbell? The section that has been published in the media refers to the petition but there was more to it, I gather. Does it offer any clues to her suicide?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Questioner: Other clues beyond the petition?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Campbell: Yes, definitely. I mean, the background, the Family Court. She mentioned that the Family Court needed to be looked at. I mean, you know, there was also the case where we were accused falsely of committing perjury in the Family Court. There are several issues to be looked at.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Questioner: Beyond the petition itself?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Campbell: Yes, definitely. I mean, there was a bankruptcy proceeding and all sorts of things. She was still to be&mdash;when she died&mdash;there was a High Court hearing still to be had on who had precedence, the Bankruptcy Court or the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Questioner: So her life had become very confused. A lot of things apparently going wrong, things drawn out, she felt down by all this. So the petition was just one factor?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Campbell: Yes, definitely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Yes, definitely,' said her mother. Yet the Liberal Party says that Carmen Lawrence was responsible for her death. And little goody-two-shoes over there was in there encouraging them all the way through. Let me quote Mrs Campbell again. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now I think that he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>she is talking about police commissioner Brian Bull&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had he spoken out and said that we had been investigated for perjury and had been cleared in writing in January the same year, I think Penny might well have rethought committing suicide.</PARA>
<PARA>This is another matter concerning the then police commissioner, and it goes on in that vein. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party have made the implicit connection in the royal commission and the explicit connection in the parliament that the petition was the sole cause of Penny Easton's death and that the Minister for Human Services and Health was the cause of the petition and the cause of her death. They have absolutely no basis for that outrageous vilification of her. This has not been tested in a coroner's inquiry. It has not been tested in a court. And, as a consequence, we find in this Mrs Campbell saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I just want this royal commission to get to the truth of how one of my daughters eventually came to commit suicide because she felt she had been set up so well there was no way out but that.</PARA>
<PARA>But then Commissioner Marks said to Mr Easton:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think you must understand that it is not my task to investigate the suicide of your former wife and you have got to realise that this witness cannot be expected to answer questions about her state of mind in a particular time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You would swear blind that, of course, all of this they come with clean hands to. But we know, by reading Western Australian <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, it was Richard Court who first raised these Family Court matters in the Legislative Assembly. There are absolutely pages of text. Let me give you a quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last week I said that Exim had sold its investment in this business to friends and relatives of senior management of Exim and at the same time had lent them money.</PARA>
<PARA>You know that the petition that Brian Easton had presented was about whether he had $200,000 coming to him outside of the Federal Court proceedings. That was what it was about. Yet here we are&mdash;with Richard Court raising this thing in the Legislative Assembly. Then you have Mr Cash, a member of the Liberal Party, who said in 1987:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is the Premier aware that in answer to a question asked in parliament he said that Mr Brian Easton had severed his financial connection with the company Eastmark at the time he was managing director of WA Exim Corporation? Can the Premier explain the fact that Mr Easton is presently being sued in his capacity as a guarantor of Eastmark's loan to the value of $182,000.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this is one side of the marriage trying to get some material in the parliament to talk about the money he was receiving. When, of course, the other side of the marriage gets into it with the Easton petition, it is a great crime. But it is all right for the  Liberal Party to introduce this stuff. Then Mr Lightfoot, another Liberal, said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is the Premier aware that the two passports of Brian Easton, the commissioner of the Western Australian Public Service Board, have been confiscated by the Federal Court? Has Mr Easton submitted his resignation to the board? If yes, on what date? Is Mr Easton to receive an ex gratia severance payment exceeding normal public service regulated payments?</PARA>
<PARA>The then Premier, Mr Burke, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know Mr Easton is passing through some marital problems at the present time&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and I suppose that is another story, but it may have something to do with it, I hesitate to say, because I don't know.</PARA>
<PARA>It was all right for the Liberal Party to raise it then, to raise all about the income of Mr Easton and to have the then Labor Premier say, `Hang on, I think there is a marital problem here,' But that did not stop them. We then had Mr Dowding coming in on behalf of the government saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been fully informed. I think it would be fair to say that the public will be watching the opposition very carefully to see whether it supports the member for Murchison-Eyre's misuse of his parliamentary position in yet again asking a question of the type he asked last night. The first thing the House should know about the question is that it breached section 121 of the Family Law Act.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, here you are, the Liberal Party, running the stuff on this settlement into parliament, breaching the Family Law Act, and you go onto it even after Dowding has rebuked you. Then Mr Lightfoot comes in with other matters:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has Brian Easton&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is a month later&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">submitted his resignation? What payments will he receive? Where will they be drawn from?</PARA>
<PARA>Then you've got Mr Masters, another Liberal:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Which former employees of WADC have received a payment?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, after all this the Speaker of the Western Australian parliament has this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer members to certain questions without notice being asked by the member for Murchison-Eyre. The point that does concern me is whether the privilege of the freedom of the House might be used to circumvent an explicit order of a court or written law of this country. Obviously, it makes a mockery of observing a sub judice convention if the House tolerates or encourages speeches or questions aimed at subverting an order or rule given in an appropriate court. Likewise, this parliament should not permit its privileges to be used to circumvent the written law of the Commonwealth aimed at protecting the personal privacy of citizens.</PARA>
<PARA>So, Mr Speaker, here is the Liberal Party over an extended period of time, raising all of the other side of the ledger in the dispute in the marriage of Penny Easton to Brian Easton. Here is the Speaker of the parliament rebuking them; the Premier suggesting that there are marital problems; Mr Dowding saying they should desist. They keep it up and keep it up and, finally, when one petition they think they can link to Carmen Lawrence suits their purposes, they narrow the terms of reference to focus on that and exonerate Court and his whole grubby bunch in this exercise. </PARA>

You see some of these dreadful things in other countries, and it is said, `Well, it couldn't happen here.' Well, it is happening here.

That is why the kangaroo court has no place in Australian politics, no place in Australian civil life. But what has a place here is morality and decency.

It gets even better: `In tough times, of course, the temptation is always to gild the lily.' He would never do that, would he? Then he went on and said, `I'll be resisting the temptation.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a nutshell, what the Prime Minister is really saying is that, because the royal commission is not investigating the circumstances of Penny Easton's death, the royal commission is of no relevance and of no account. It follows from that, according to the Prime Minister, that if you are in public life, you can lie through your teeth, you can say anything you like and you cannot be brought to account for it and you cannot be brought to book for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is, in essence, what the Prime Minister is saying. He is saying that because the royal commission is not investigating the death of Penny Easton, because it is only focusing on knowledge of the tabling of the petition, therefore it is of no account. It doesn't matter what Carmen Lawrence said or did. It does not matter what Keith Wilson or Pam Beggs said or did. None of those things are of any relevance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government has done over the last couple of months is set about to deliberately devalue the notion that ministers ought to tell the truth. That is what they have tried to do. Do you know why they are trying to do that? They are trying to do that because they are preparing the way to repudiate the findings of the royal commission if those findings are politically uncomfortable for Carmen Lawrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian public&mdash;through all of the bluster and through all of those sitting in dumb silence on the back bench of the Labor Party while their own leader was speaking&mdash;has to understand that you are, lemming-like, being led over the cliff towards a situation where, if this royal commission brings down an adverse finding against Carmen Lawrence, your leader and deputy leader are going to get up and repudiate the recommendations of the royal commission. They are already paving the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way you pave the way for that repudiation is to devalue the notion that it is important that ministers tell the truth in public life.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, what the Deputy Prime Minister was saying is `We reserve the right to utterly repudiate the royal commission recommendations, take no notice of it, ignore the fact that it could well be 12 to one by the time the royal commission is finished'&mdash;in other words, reject the finding of the royal commission if it comes out against Carmen Lawrence, and say to the Australian public, `It doesn't really matter, because she didn't have her hand in the till. It doesn't matter, because it does not involve any dereliction of her duty as Minister for Human Services and Health.' The fact that she actually lied and the fact that she engaged in a cover-up&mdash;the fact that she may have been guilty of the watergate crime of cover-up&mdash;are not really going to matter.

He knew who he was ideologically aligned with. He knew who had a bit of strength around the place. What John Howard would not do was to confront anybody with a bit of strength, and we have that here again today in this censure motion and in his alternative to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us get back to the issues at stake in regard to this royal commission. There is no term of reference in this royal commission which suggests that it will get to the bottom in any way, or even attempt to get to the bottom, of Penny Easton's suicide. This has to be the ultimate in cynicism: to use the fact that, because it has been a matter of such public comment and controversy over the years, there is a concern about the circumstances of the death of Penny Easton, to link that up with a political attack upon the minister for health, and then to arrive at no conclusions. `Let it out there in the ether, let it run, but let's have no conclusions on it'&mdash;that is the objective of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem for the Leader of the Opposition is that, instead of maintaining discipline, three of his frontbenchers have in the last 24 hours exposed the intention&mdash;exposed what they want the public to believe as opposed to what they have been prepared to say. When John Howard first started commenting on these things, he said, `I'm not going to comment on any evidence. I'm going to say nothing about the royal commission.' When asked about connections between the two, he likes to say, `There's no connection between the two that I would care to comment on.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But John Howard has got them out there exposing the intention of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. Its intention for those three on the front bench who have already spoken&mdash;we are not talking about some bunch of eccentric backbenchers, though the Liberal Party has plenty of those; we are talking about three people whom the Liberal Party would make ministers, that is what we are talking about: not some eccentric dissident on the back benches but three people the Liberal Party would make ministers&mdash;is for them to get out in the public and make those connections explicit, those connections which it hopes will sink into the public mind anyway, despite the fact there is not a scintilla of evidence of a connection between the two events and despite the fact that as far as it is concerned there will be in the terms of reference of the royal commission no attempt to address that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an inquest into the death of Penny Easton, but that inquest goes to only the fact of suicide&mdash;not its cause. A coronial inquiry is required to establish that. In the absence of a coronial inquiry, a term of reference for a royal commissioner is required to establish that, but there is nothing there because they do not want it investigated. What  they simply want is a cowardly attack on the minister and then, for their own purposes, a linkage in the public mind that they hope will be explicit in the public mind but only implicit in theirs as far as they are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what do you get from that royal commission? They say that the government has no right to, first, defend its minister in public and, second, regard this royal commission as, by its terms of reference, an involvement questioning important institutional issues which go to the heart of the operation of politics in this country&mdash;that is, parliamentary privilege and cabinet confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do love this stance that has been taken on cabinet confidentiality. All that you want to talk about is what were supposed to be discussions in cabinet. When invited by the royal commission into government activities in Western Australia to address the issue of cabinet confidentiality, what did Richard Court have to say before he set this commission running on exactly that subject? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secrecy of cabinet proceedings is fundamental to underpinning the doctrines of cabinet solidarity and collective responsibility under which all ministers, irrespective of their individual reviews, are required to support cabinet decisions outside the cabinet room, particularly in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the position of Richard Court on cabinet secrecy when invited to make a change in it in relation to the operations of his government. That is a doctrine which we would espouse. That is a doctrine which you would espouse&mdash;yet, on matters that go to nothing criminal, on matters that go to nothing in regard to maladministration, on matters that go to nothing in regard to a major breakdown of public institutions, you are prepared, cynically, to sit behind the product of a massive breaching of that rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have sat behind that product and made liars of yourselves when it comes to standards that you regard you would be under. If you were ever elected to office, do you think for one minute that we would get a ball by ball description of what your or anyone else's recollections were of what happened at a cabinet meeting? Do you think for one minute that we would get that? Do you think for one minute that we got that in seven years of Fraser's operations, in the government in which you served? Not on your nelly. Yet, uniquely, you decide that Carmen Lawrence should be subject to tests based upon a breaching of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cynically let that run. Just like you knocked over all the conventions in 1975, you will let a convention run until it impacts upon your opportunity to make an attack on the Labor Party; then it does not matter what convention it is. It does not matter what principle it is&mdash;straight out the window it goes. That is what the Liberal Party's position is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in the last 24 hours Liberal Party members took it too far. They took it too far by making a linkage that is not under investigation, that they are not entitled to by any facts that are known and that will not be established by any processes under way. They took it over the top, and the response of the Leader of the Opposition was, as his response was in Western Australia, to get out a feather duster and lightly dust over his frontbenchers and let them continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the position of the Leader of the Opposition. It is for that that he is censured&mdash;that and the cynical way he and his supporters in Western Australia have used this issue over the last couple of months. And he invites us to have respect for the processes. He invites us to take at face value whatever is found. He invites us to regard Richard Court as the epitome of public taste when it comes to the issue of the principles which underpin our constitutional arrangements. Sorry, sport, we are not in it. </PARA>

If that was to make out that this House seriously had any basis whatsoever by proven conduct to censure the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), it was a complete failure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the speech all we had was a farrago of nonsense, a turning on itself of charges which validly lay against the government in relation to ministerial standards and a pathetic performance in an attempt, which this really is, to draw a smokescreen against the scandalous behaviour of a minister of this government, to draw a smokescreen across the scandalous failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to insist on standards and to try to draw a smokescreen over a pathetic failure at the National Press Club earlier this day. </PARA>

He finds that the press, like the people of Australia, want to know about the character of this Prime Minister. They want to know whether they can trust him to enforce standards. They would have seen&mdash;it was there for everybody to see down at the press club&mdash;the historically low standards that this government is now priding itself on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funniest line of the Deputy Prime Minister when he got up to speak was to say that the Leader of the Opposition relies on the fact that nobody has a historical memory. Who has been relying on the fact that nobody has a historical memory? Who has been saying that recollections differ? Who has been saying, `Years after the event, you can't get to the truth?' Who has been trying to cloud the issues? Whose memory were they hoping could not be relied on? These were the people whose memories Dr Lawrence hoped could not be relied on&mdash;Keith Wilson, Pam Beggs, Jim McGinty, Graham Edwards, Ian Taylor, Judyth Watson, John Kobelke, Eric Ripper, Marcelle Anderson, Bob Willoughby and Zoltan Kovacs. It is about 11-zip in the royal commission. We are waiting for all this massive evidence. It is just like the ball going through the opposition goal; it just keeps on going and nothing ever comes back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that really amused me&mdash;and the Prime Minister was at it again&mdash;was that this was all some kind of Liberal Party conspiracy. He said the Liberal Party had set this all up to damage Dr Lawrence. Look at the conspirators of the Liberal Party working on it: Keith Wilson; Pam Beggs; another conspirator from the Liberal Party, Jim McGinty; a well-known Liberal, Graham Edwards; another one, Ian Taylor; a long-time Liberal, Judyth Watson; another long-time Liberal, John Kobelke; another lifelong Liberal, Eric Ripper; another known Liberal, Marcelle Anderson; a dedicated Liberal staffer, Bob Willoughby; and another one, Zoltan Kovacs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder that we weren't actually in government in Western Australia when Carmen Lawrence was the Premier. We had the whole cabinet.

Will that be the next allegation? We had all of the members. It was actually us. I suppose Brian Burke was another one of the conspirators. Was he in it too, or David Parker?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the most pathetic defence you have ever seen. This is a fact: the Labor Party, your own ministers, your own colleagues, your own staffers, your own ticket holders, are coming out and giving evidence against Dr Lawrence. And we go back to the tried and true, `Oh, it's all a conspiracy by the Liberal Party.' What a pathetic defence! The other tactic that this government always engages in is that it always accuses its opponent of its own crime. If you've got the money and someone has seen you put it in your pocket, it is the other bloke who took it. You had to laugh when the Prime Minister got up and said that the opposition had been elevating untruth into an art form. This is from the Picasso of untruth who, over a long, distinguished career, has turned this place into an art form, has turned it on its head. What was the other allegation that was made? The Leader of the Opposition should be censured for doing what? For taking back tax cuts! What about l-a-w? Do you remember that? The l-i-e!</PARA>

Nobody could have doubted it from the performance that we had from the Prime Minister. He said, `The Liberal Party is in this up to its neck.' Thank you, Keith Wilson, Pam Beggs, Jim McGinty! It is all there and it is clear to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the Opposition said, what is this about? This is about whether or not you can believe the word of a minister, because if you cannot believe the word of Dr Carmen Lawrence on a thing like this you cannot believe it on anything. If you cannot believe her word on factual circumstances that she was personally involved in, the fact is that she cannot retain the confidence of this House. The fact is that, if the Prime Minister will not insist upon that particular standard, it is up to this parliament, led by this opposition, to make sure that he does. That is what this whole issue is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I find amazing is this repeated&mdash;as if by repeating a falsehood you somehow make it true&mdash;claim that what we are looking at are events that happened years ago. Let me tell you where this all comes from. It comes from a statement that Dr Lawrence made to the Western Australian parliament on 10 November 1992, a day after the Easton suicide. She was asked, `Did you know about it prior to the petition being tabled?' She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just a minute, member for Kingsley. After discussions with the petitioner and on the advice of the Clerk of the Legislative Council, Hon. John Halden adopted the appropriate processes and tabled the petition at a time of his choosing. I was informed that he was to do that and I learned the detail of the petition and its general thrust upon its tabling. That is the way it is and that is the way I have explained it. That is the position.</PARA>
<PARA>The critical question here is: can you trust a statement that Dr Lawrence makes in a parliament? It was not just in the Western Australian parliament. She went back to the National Press Club and she stuck to the story. There is no room here for her to start sliding off her story. There is no room for her to say, `Well, perhaps I did raise it in the cabinet' or `Perhaps it was discussed in the cabinet.' The one thing she was always firm about was that she had learned the detail upon the tabling, that there had been no prior engagement by her, discussion by her or motivation by her in relation to this petition. She said at the National Press Club:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, I want to be very clear about that. I was told, to the best of my recollection, the night before that Mr Halden would brief me on the petition the next morning. The next morning the focus of it, as I said, was very clear on the embarrassment it may cause to Court. My knowledge of the involvement of the Eastons and Family Court details of it occurred at the same time as it was tabled or after I read it after it was tabled and there was interest in the matter. I was not aware of it until it was tabled.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the statement that she made at the National Press Club. That was the statement she made to the Australian people. That was the statement that Labor minister after Labor minister and Labor staffer after Labor staffer have come in and contested. That is the very heart of the question as to whether this minister is capable, in a sticky situation, of telling the truth. </PARA>

Because she cannot verify her own truthfulness, neither can any senior minister of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You, Deputy Prime Minister, have been asked to verify her truthfulness. You do not do so. The Prime Minister was asked at the press club today: do you accept her credibility? He will not answer that question.

And you are preparing the ground to try to walk away from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I tell you this: if you walk away from this, you walk away from any faith any Australian could ever have again that truthfulness is a requirement of holding ministerial office in a Keating government.

All week there has been this long silence. We have been putting these questions in the parliament all week: is it a standard required by the government of ministers to tell the truth? Are ministers required to tell the truth, and is lying a breach of their responsibility to the public?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have been ducking and weaving, failing to answer that question. You look confused. You look baffled. When you are asked, `Is it a requirement of a minister to tell the truth?' you think it is a trick question. If there is a requirement that has been put on ministers right throughout the history of federation in a Westminster system, it is that. It is the most obvious requirement. Why do you think it is a hanging offence to deceive the parliament? Because deceiving or misleading the parliament is indicative of the fact that you cannot be trusted with the truth.

What you see now is the process where, if a government gets into an indefensible position&mdash;where you get a scandal, where you get a corruption&mdash;it eats right into the heart of that government. It starts dragging in, in a spider-like way, other ministers. Lawrence cannot be trusted with the truth. Lawrence has done the wrong thing, and now the Deputy Prime Minister is in. Now the Prime Minister is in. Now the whole of the caucus has been asked to be dragged in. You see a government being sucked into the vortex of its own ministerial failures, sucked into the vortex of its own poor standards, sucked into the vortex of deceit and deception.

Can anyone in this House&mdash;and some of the members here have seen their share of royal commissions and have seen them pass by over the years&mdash;remember a royal commission that was not conducted in at least one of those areas of criminality, of illegality, of corruption or at least some area of public policy? Of course you cannot because this royal commission is completely unprecedented in Australian political history. It does no credit to parliament and to governments across this country that political standards have apparently slipped so low that this royal commission can be started by the Western Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we go to the terms of reference of the royal commission. If you wanted to stitch someone up, you have to give the Liberals credit for being successful in the way they have gone through the process. The terms of reference do not go to the question of the suicide. In April Dr Wooldridge was out there setting the scene, which was reinforced by the members yesterday that we associate in the public's mind the death, this tragic event, with Dr Lawrence: get that into the ether, get that into people's minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the royal commission asked to look at the causes of the suicide? No. The terms of reference do not even go to that very point. The royal commissioner himself made it clear just about on day one of the royal commission&mdash;`It is not my job to look at the causes of the woman's suicide. I'm not asked to do that. The terms of reference given to me by the Western Australian government don't even go to that point.' The terms of reference, oddly enough, strangely enough, only go to about one small portion of the entire events. They certainly do not go to the involvement of Premier Court in relation to his actions in the parliament. They apparently do not go to the actions of other Liberal Party ministers in the parliament when they were then in opposition. They go to none of these matters at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that the Deputy Premier of the Western Australian government makes these observations about the royal commission being a political exercise, being a waste of taxpayers' money, being damned and condemned before it even starts? Is it any wonder that Mr Barnett&mdash;the other prominent Liberal Party frontbencher in Western Australia&mdash;has very pronouncedly divorced himself from being involved? It is no surprise at all because it is what it is. There is not a person in this country who does not think that if Carmen Lawrence had left politics, was teaching philosophy at some university, was anywhere but sitting on the front bench of the federal government there would be any royal commission. If there were no federal minister involved, there would be no royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was this royal commission set up because Richard Court had great feelings about this and once he got into government he had to sort out these matters? Did he do it in the first week he was there or the first month or six months after and got himself settled in government and got his priorities in order? Did he do it after one year of being in government? It took him over two years to set up this particular event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surprise, surprise! What was happening at the same time? One Senator Noel Crichton-Browne was running on a rampage through the west. We have federal police raiding the offices of federal Liberal MPs. We have&mdash;how many is it now; I'm losing count&mdash;one, two or three federal Western Australian MPs now sitting with our friends on the crossbenches, having left the Western Australian Liberal Party. Surprise, surprise! When these events occurred, then the royal commission was established by Mr Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Deputy Premier of Western Australia says it is a political exercise. We all know that it is a political exercise. We all know that it is one of the grubbiest, sleaziest and nastiest that it has ever been our dishonour to witness in this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not buy for one moment that this was a heat of the moment, slip of the tongue, `I'm sorry, I went too far' exercise. Dr Wooldridge himself, through his cold and cool deliberations of putting this into the public debate, not yesterday but months ago, at the time of the preconditions of setting up this royal commission, has condemned this opposition. It has condemned the Leader of the Opposition by his failure to rebuke that shadow minister at that time. By his silence he has condoned and associated himself with this grubby exercise. He stands condemned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), which is that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this House censures the Prime Minister for his arrogant and elitist style which is exemplified by his action and the actions of his Ministers in attempting to devalue the importance of Ministers being absolutely truthful in dealing with the public.</PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the House that members ought to support that amendment and reject the specious censure motion which has been put by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I start with a technicality, which will be of absolutely no interest to the government because the forms of the House are irrelevant to them. It is part of their contempt of the parliament. I point out that page 347 of House <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> states that such a motion is bad precedent and should never be delivered. Not only is it bad precedent but, just as a matter of political commonsense, if you continue to put up baseless, irrelevant, without foundation censure motions, obviously over time you will rather devalue their currency. Quite frankly, a third censure motion against the Leader of the Opposition in the last six or seven months spells only one thing; that is, this whole thing is a political exercise because he is under your skin. He is ahead of you in the polls and you are worried about your prospects in the forthcoming election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just dispose of the technical attack on the Leader of the Opposition. I would be the first one, I suppose, in a proper way to actually refer to the words of the censure motion. There has been this argument, and the completely over-the-top remarks of the Prime Minister, that the Leader of the Opposition had somehow orchestrated, condoned or encouraged the remarks of some of our colleagues in the last 24 hours. Yet on the very front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I am not going to say anything more about this because it is such a trivial point and so baseless is the censure motion&mdash;it is made quite clear. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A spokesman for Mr Howard said last night the Coalition was not alleging Dr Lawrence was to blame for Ms Easton's death.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in the paper this morning. That is the end of the basis upon which the whole censure motion is put today. I say no more about it. We can now turn to the reality, the real motive behind this censure motion, which is basically a distraction for a government because they are on the political back foot. The reason they are on the political back foot is that a senior minister in this government, one touted at one stage to be Deputy Prime Minister, said one thing in her state parliament a few years ago and has since been demonstrated to have not been telling the truth. It is as simple as that. I thought the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) made a very nice analogy when he said that the truth for the Labor Party was like yellowcake&mdash;something to be avoided at all costs. There is a certain truth about it in his remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting sort of explanation for the Labor Party's attitude about this matter&mdash;and take it from our perspective; I have been here for 10 years too long on the opposition side of the benches and, in a way, I am used to them not telling the truth&mdash;is that it is a daily occurrence. It just amazes me that people come to me, such as the bloke who rang me up this morning about a particular matter. He had heard Mr Keating say something, and he rang to tell me that it was not the truth. It was as if I should issue a press release to say that Mr Keating does not tell the truth. What that bloke could not quite understand was that such a press release would simply join an avalanche of press releases&mdash;that, basically, it is just not news. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the Opposition made so patently clear in his brilliant address, the Prime Minister on his elevation to the prime ministership made the declaration to the Australian people that they could count on him, that during his prime ministership he would tell the truth&mdash;and virtually every day since then he has broken that very rule.

At the top of the editorial there is a quote:</PARA>

<PARA>In other words, `We are justified in lying.' This is the whole raison d'etre of their views about truth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was rudely interrupted by that storm of falsehood and malice, I was making some remarks about the dangerous notion of directed investment, concerning a falsity doing the rounds of the financial media regarding the possible use of superannuation funds to fund venture capital, developmental capital or infrastructure projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I was trying to make was that this notion of market failure being attributed to fund managers was quite false and that fund managers should be left to do their job according to the covenants contained in section 52 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, which is the parent act of the legislation which we are seeking to amend today. I expect that debate to continue for some months. I will do my best to participate in the debate in the media, to quash this notion that in some way a government's advice or direction to a superannuation fund manager is inherently superior to the judgments that that fund manager might make according to the quality of investment opportunities presented to him or her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally speaking, the impression among the electors with whom I have discussed superannuation is that it is too complicated. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in his remarks earlier today made the same point&mdash;that it is very difficult to imagine public enthusiasm, which is perhaps even more important than public confidence, in superannuation, and it is very difficult to see public enthusiasm growing in an environment where things are just too complicated to possibly understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall with some dismay the remarks of Dr FitzGerald when he addressed a conference sponsored by the Australian Superannuation Funds Association in June this year at the Hyatt Hotel in Canberra. He described the superannuation regime as resembling a Sony music machine: it looked very slick and very attractive on the outside, but inside it was fiendishly complicated and, therefore, any investigation as to what was going on inside the machine should simply be left to experts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is permitted for legislatures and governments to create a regime for superannuation that is so ferociously complicated that the ordinary citizens, whose funds are the subject of these laws, are not even permitted implicitly to investigate and understand it for themselves, then where are we ever going to generate the enthusiasm that is required beyond what exists now? One glance or one small exposure to the nomenclature of superannuation, with terms such as `transferable RBLs' and so forth, makes it quite plain that, so long as we fail in our efforts to somehow simplify this system and make it a bit more user friendly&mdash;to use a popular term these days&mdash;the notion of thrift will really not take hold with as much success as it is necessary to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Supervision of superannuation, as it is conducted in this country, is plainly a requirement of generating that needed public confidence. Just as the member for Curtin, who is in the chair now, has described some of the woes that his constituents have brought to him, I can say that I have experienced exactly the same thing in my short time as the member for Wentworth. Two weeks ago, a lady came in to see me. A resident of Perth, she had made the decision to move to Sydney&mdash;laudable though that is&mdash;but had left behind in a Perth superannuation fund some $80,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After working for a short time in Sydney, she consulted a financial intermediary who advised her that the best thing she could do was to roll over the money and transfer it to a fund in New South Wales, where she could have much closer access to the fund managers who were investing it for her. She signed a rollover authority, giving that financial intermediary authority to direct the fund in Western Australia to transfer the money via a bank&mdash;the Commonwealth Bank, as a matter of fact&mdash;to a fund in New South Wales, in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somehow or other&mdash;and this is not clear&mdash;the intermediary used that authority to persuade an officer of the bank in Perth to transfer that money via telegraphic transfer to his own bank account, giving the impression that he was acting as her agent and that he had her authority. Sadly, he misappropriated those funds to satisfy his own personal debts. </PARA>
<PARA>Shortly thereafter, he was detected and charged with a variety of fraudulent acts and, of course, a bankruptcy petition was lodged against him. Westpac, which was his bank, appropriated the money in his account to satisfy outstanding debts that he had with it. Result? Dr R's money vanished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She went to the ISC, the commissioner, whose budget apparently we are dealing with today. If this late lodgment levy we are talking about is some sort of user-pays scheme for approved funds to fund the cost of supervision, then we are talking about the commissioner's role in the scheme of superannuation. I wonder whether you can guess what the answer was from the commissioner? `No, it is a bank problem. It is not a super problem. It was the bank that transferred the money from itself in Perth to another bank in New South Wales. I am sorry. It is not a superannuation problem. Go and see the bank ombudsman.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking advice from this commissioner and believing it, Dr R went to see the bank ombudsman. Guess what he said? `It is a super problem, not a bank problem. It was from a super fund. The authority you signed for this villain was an authority to roll over your super money, so go and see the commissioner.' Result? She went to see her MP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I heard this, early in my career, I thought, `Well, this is how government works these days, isn't it?' You set up a commission, you set up an ombudsman, you fund them, you give them cars, you see them flying between the capitals of this country, bolstering the airlines' profits. And what do they do? They write letters to our constituents saying, `Oh, no, it's not us. Go and see our brethren down the road.' No help at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This woman, who is practising as a psychologist in Paddington but living in my electorate, is now impecunious. She cannot afford the legal fees that you can imagine she would incur if she took on Westpac. We have all had people in our offices who are victims of various acts of misunderstanding or villainy by banks. There are not a few of them in the country. The prospect of challenging them in the courts is fanciful,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The undertaking I gave to her was to seek the help of a large Sydney law firm which was prepared to act for her on a pro bono basis. It was only a couple of days before I headed back down here that a nice bureaucratic form turned up in my office, an application for pro bono work to be done, via the Law Institute. I will do my very best to see that she gets that service because, by God, she deserves it, the commissioner having done absolutely nothing to help her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where money accumulates, it is sad to say, so will villains accumulate, so will people whose standards of honesty and integrity do not measure up to those prescribed in the legislation. It is important that, whilst we try not to overcomplicate the process of regulation, and certainly of establishing and operating super funds, we make sure that the public is satisfied that acts of imprudent management and imprudent investment are the subject of some sort of action in the legislation we consider in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect it is as well to recall the trouble that occurred in the bond markets last year. I have had a few people come into my office with documents saying that they had invested in a capital stable fund. What does that mean to the ordinary person in the street? It means that the principal stays at what it was when you invested it and that you accrue interest as time passes&mdash;nothing too risky. Well, that was hardly the case last year when, as I said earlier, the bond market looked like a Quentin Tarantino movie, with blood everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who went long in bonds in early 1994, on the basis that they were a safe investment, finished the year behind where they started. There were some, of course, who were not so imprudent and did not act with such recklessness. They have been the subject of critical remarks I have made in this place&mdash;in particular, the officers of the Reserve Bank who sit on the investment committee of their in-house superannuation fund and who somehow managed to reduce their bond weighting to zero early last year; not, I am glad to acknowledge, in absolute anticipation of the bank raising interest rates, but through some bizarre and, for them, extremely lucky coincidence. But that is not the only example of peculiar management of superannuation funds. There are many others, and that is for me to deal with at another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue regarding the use of superannuation funds that pops up from time to time in something of an emotive fashion is the use of derivatives in the management of superannuation funds. Before I go much further, I would like to put a proposition to the House that where the investment risk&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the recess the Queensland election was held and a very strong message came out&mdash;not only for the Goss government but for parliamentarians all around Australia&mdash;that we should go back to basics, listen to what people are saying and try to reflect their interests in this House. I thought it would be an interesting exercise to test this proposition before the floor of the House. A letter has been written to me by a 14-year-old. I would like to read the letter in full. It shows an attitude on the part of one of our young people. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Braithwaite,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a student in year 9 at Mirani State High School. In Social Science we have been studying Parliament and we know it's a two way street. So I would like to share my concerns on youth homelessness with you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You and I have been fortunate enough to have a good life and people who care about us but many youth are homeless because they have been sexually or physically abused or their parents don't want them. It isn't always their fault. Most are not old enough to vote so these people need people to voice their needs. Many of them have appalling living conditions and not enough warm clothes or nutrition, so they have poor health. Homeless youth have very grim employment prospects as most leave school at 15 and as a result have very few job skills. Because they haven't got the security of a job or support from caring families they are left wide open to exploitation. They need money to survive so many turn to prostitution or other crimes; such as breaking and entering and mugging. But perhaps the biggest problems are drug abuse, youth who don't want to be helped and the public's attitude to this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is up to the whole of Australia to do something about this problem. The first step to reducing this problem is to change the public's attitude; this could be achieved by Education Programmes so they learn just what homeless people go through. Homeless youth don't just need a house, money and food although refuges, halfway houses, benefits and charity organisations are really helpful. Refuges and halfway houses are just places to sleep for a short time. But what these kids really need is a home. Somewhere where they are safe, are wanted, somewhere where they are loved and where they belong. The benefits the government give out are helpful but they are not enough. Another way to help homeless youth stand on their own two feet is to help them find employment. Special training programmes could be set up to help those who want help. This would help them to get a job, gain self-confidence and find a new direction in life. Although all this would cost a lot of money if this problem could be halved then other problems such as crime would be reduced as well and that would be one less serious problem for Australia to find an answer for. Because I believe that all people deserve a fair go in life.</PARA>
<PARA>She says that she is interested in hearing what I have to say about it and thanks me for my attention. I believe this comes to the nub of a problem that for too long we have looked at and done nothing about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give some facts and figures. The recent report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs estimated that 22,000 Australians under the age of 18 are homeless. That is bigger than a fair sized town in my electorate. The national youth housing strategy discussion paper released in March said that there were 162,000 people aged 15 to 24 living below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are very vital statistics. The trouble with statistics is that we view them as such. We have heard mentioned many times the fact that two million jobs have been created since I don't know when. We know that people are entitled to be placed in the statistics if they are employed for two hours or more in a casual capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the other statistic we hear about is the 10 per cent unemployment figure. It is getting better; it is only nine per cent this month. We fail to realise that in that 10 or nine per cent there are people who are desperately looking for something to do, looking for a job. Kathleen Zarb of Finch Hatton says they want help. She mentions the drug problem being the first problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lions Drug Awareness Foundation newsletter came onto my desk today. This is a service in the community that is carrying on the work that government is not. I am not saying that government should, but it is a recognition that we should give to these people. More should be allowed for them to further their aim in life. Life Education is another program that goes without the benefit of government support, by way of a tax deduction. I believe every parliamentarian and every politician should concern themselves with all of these programs. I just want to congratulate Kathleen for speaking out. I hope we can answer the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the international campaign to ban landmines. The Australian Land Mines Network is planning a national day of awareness on 28 August to heighten awareness of the landmines crisis. Over 80 organisations will be participating in this national day of action. In Sydney, prominent Australians such as Gabi Hollows, Justice Marcus Einfeld and representatives of bodies of the Catholic Church will urge the Australian government to support the ban on the use, trade, production and stockpiling of anti-personnel mines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are over 100 million landmines laid in more than 60 countries, killing over 10,000 civilians each year. According to UNICEF, between 30 to 40 per cent of landmine victims are children. While the United Nations and countries including Austria, Belgium, Cambodia and Sweden have thrown their weight behind this global ban, Australia maintains that landmines are a legitimate weapon in terms of defensive warfare. I would argue that we do not make these weapons in this country. We do not have a use for them, not since the Vietnam war. I would argue that we strongly support the ban. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Australian government has provided assistance for mine clearance operation, it only supports a ban on landmines that do not have a self-destruct or self-neutralisation capacity. There are arguments that landmines are a military necessity. The long-term human and socioeconomic costs far outweigh any short-term military utility. Chemical weapons have been said by some to be useful in times of war also, but their impact on human beings has been so devastating that they have been banned. Landmines must also go into that category because they are uncontrollable and they are an indiscriminate sort of weapon whose eventual target cannot be determined by the military and is more likely to be a civilian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that self-destruct and self-neutralising mines are not reliable. It is difficult to obtain an accurate figure of their failure rate. Certainly, a meeting of experts called the International Committee of the Red Cross suggests at least 10 per cent is a realistic failure rate. That failure rate means that any area mined with smart mines will have to be cleared just as carefully as an area covered with conventional mines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the poorer countries in the developing world will oppose a ban on anti-personnel mines unless smart mines, at least, are included. This is because smart mines are far more expensive to buy and the richer countries would be in control of supply, make a profit and have easier access to these weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of recent international moves, Belgium has enacted legislation for a total ban on the production of stockpiling transfer and the use of anti-personnel landmines; such legislation is to be reviewed within five years. A moratorium on export of anti-personnel mines is to be placed in 15 states including Canada, France, Great Britain, South Africa and the United States of America. Italy has a moratorium on production in Italian territory. The United States Senate has voted for an amendment which would place a moratorium on the use and deployment of landmines after a three-year period for the US army to test and deploy alternative tactics and weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">States which have declared support for a total ban include Belgium, Sweden, Mexico, Italy, Ireland, Cambodia, Switzerland, Afghanistan and Estonia. Even more importnat is that countries see a ban as a desirable goal. Australia, unfortunately, has not yet declared its support. More African states will attend a review conference and 13 countries have indicated their support for the total ban. Certainly what needs to be done is a twofold approach&mdash;that is, the clearing of mines in place at present and a commitment of funds to the research and the development of mine clearance technology and a total ban on the production, use, transfer, export, sale and stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with a quote from Ken Done, who has been very supportive as an UNICEF goodwill ambassador. I was on the board of UNICEF for seven years and am a life member. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I urge all Australians to support the efforts of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines to achieve a total ban of their production, sale, marketing, export and use on this National Day of Action. Landmines pose one of the most serious risks to the safety and well-being of millions of people around the world. At present some 100 million landmines are in place and another 100 million mines lie in stockpiles ready for use. Children are particularly vulnerable because of their natural curiosity. Landmines come in a bewildering array of shapes and colours. The sheer number of them in some countries leads children to regard them as harmless, every day objects. The cruelty of these weapons and their growing cost in human and economic terms is a catastrophe. They must be banned entirely and as soon as possible.</PARA>

As you are probably aware, the seat of Moore contains the fastest growing municipality of Western Australia, the city of Wanneroo. One of the most difficult problems facing young people in the area is the dearth of proper swimming facilities for Olympic or competitive swimming training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 15 February of this year, written by David Marsh, in which there was a call to lift WA's swim facilities, in particular in the northern suburbs of Perth. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A lack of facilities is stunting the growth of swimming in WA, a review for the WA Swimming Association has found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review, prepared by Ernst and Young Consulting, identified insufficient 50m pools and year-round heated pools in country and metropolitan areas as the main deficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It suggested that the WASA lobby local governments for an improvement in the quality and availability of facilities, with an emphasis on heating existing pools.</PARA>
<PARA>The review pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Councils are not orientated towards competition in swimming. They provide 25m recreational pools which are unsuitable for lap swimming."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It said the northern coastal corridor was particularly hard done by in the provision of 50m pools.</PARA>
<PARA>The president of the WA Swimming Association, Lynne Bates, praised the review and said that it was an excellent blueprint for Western Australian swimming into the 21st century. She pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Swimming has always been one of this State's highest profile sports with an outstanding record of achievement at national and international levels.</PARA>
<PARA>This coincides with a movement by a group known as 50 Metre Swimming Pool for Wanneroo. It is pushing to have a 50-metre swimming facility constructed at Wanneroo to allow for young people in the fastest growing municipality of Australia to properly take advantage of swimming and be able to train properly for competitive swimming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have called on Landcorp, which is a state government instrumentality which has responsibility for construction of these types of facilities in that area, particularly in the city of Joondalup, to look at the construction of a 50-metre swimming facility at the Arena complex in Joondalup. That is a new sporting complex, of which I imagine there are not many in the country, but unfortunately lacks a 50-metre swimming facility for young people. The northern suburbs is in dire need of olympian standard swimming pools to ensure that the emerging crop of athletes can reach their potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there are a number of small recreational facilities, like the Craigie Leisure Centre, these are unsuitable for the full development of the potential of the local young swimmers. Presently, facilities are rapidly becoming overcrowded. That also goes for the other more competitive types of swimming pool activities, including water polo&mdash;and that also has the lack of an appropriate standard facility for young water polo players. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I repeat: present facilities are becoming overcrowded. I am informed that recently 88 swimmers graduated from the junior swimming squad at Craigie leisure centre, of whom only 48 were able to join the mini squad. This means that up to 40 talented young swimmers may be lost to the sport through lack of suitable training facilities. Many of these youngsters who may miss out are potential champions of the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Landcorp, which has reaped great dividends from its activities in the northern suburbs&mdash;in particular, through the sale of the Joondalup Country Club, from which it reaped a benefit of $20 million&mdash;should use some of this windfall money to provide facilities for local young swimmers. With the large numbers of children participating in local swimming programs, the provision of a 50-metre pool in Wanneroo or Joondalup would be one way that Landcorp could give back something worth while and lasting to the community which so strongly has supported it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Failing a favourable response from Landcorp, there may be the possibility for a facility to be jointly provided by the state government and the Wanneroo City Council.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 November last year I raised in the House, in the context of debate on the Racial Hatred Bill 1994, my concerns about an incident that had occurred at a company in Brisbane involving some Spanish speaking workers, originating in particular from El Salvador. Those workers were on strike as a result of discriminatory behaviour that had occurred at their workplace, Steel-Line Doors, and as a number of them had been subjected to violence, intimidation, harassment and injury, with all of those incidents being racially based. On that previous occasion, I outlined to the House my concern about this incident and the fact that it was a poor situation to have occurred in Australia&mdash;as it is in contrast to the normally very good race relations which occur in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to be able to outline to the House that after many months there has been a settlement to this dispute and, in fact, the workers' position has been vindicated in that settlement. A few days ago, in early August, the management of Steel-Line Doors reached an agreement with the workers and their legal representatives, through the Anti-Discrimination Tribunal, in a hearing in front of the President of the Queensland Anti-Discrimination Tribunal, Ms R. Atkinson. This resolution and settlement has totally and completely vindicated the workers position on this matter&mdash;and I am pleased that that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a very long period for these workers. They have been on strike and, therefore, without income for some eight or nine months. They have all had many struggles. They escaped their homeland and come to this country as refugee immigrants. In doing so, all personal resources, all personal belongings which had been accumulated over the years had to be left behind. They were living in rental accommodation and had suffered greatly from their experiences in their former homeland&mdash;and it was an enormous tragedy that these workers also had to suffer such racial discrimination after having arrived in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully, the justice system in this country has vindicated their position, and they have received a settlement which is in their favour. In fact, their settlement is the largest settlement to have been arrived at against a company or corporation in Queensland by the Anti-Discrimination Commission. The settlement involves the company making a payment to the workers of the sum of $85,000, such sum to be distributed amongst the complainants as they choose. It roughly works out at a payment per person of about $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company will ensure that enterprise bargaining agreements, when finalised, shall include dispute handling procedures for complaints of discrimination. The company will also ensure that those workers who choose not to return to their employment at Steel-Line Doors&mdash;and, Mr Speaker, you can imagine that a lot of them do not wish to&mdash;will get Department of Social Security separation certificates. Also, the company management is required to publish an apology to the workers for the upset and hurt that they have suffered as a result of the practices that were engaged in by the management and other workers of that company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will also be receiving, as a result of this settlement, all of their holiday pay entitlement that they had accrued up until the moment they went on strike, plus an additional 1 1/2 weeks pay. It is not a large amount of money for every individual worker. It works out around $6,500 per worker, but that is not what they were on about. They were seeking justice for their claims of discrimination and victimisation, and I am pleased that that has been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My congratulations go, firstly, to the workers for their determination and their grit through this very painful process and to the leader of the group, George Rodriguez. Secondly, I wish to express my sincere congratulations to the men's lawyer, Mr Joe Teixeira, who has done an outstanding job in representing their case and in ensuring that these workers did receive justice in the end.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to note briefly tonight the death some three weeks ago of Sir Bernard Callinan. As many members in this place will be aware, Bernard Callinan was the Chairman of the Parliament House Construction Authority between 1979 and 1985. It is therefore appropriate that there be some record in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of this place of his passing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not know Sir Bernard Callinan in that capacity, but I did know him in other capacities. His contribution to this country, not simply as the Chairman of the Parliament House Construction Authority but in a whole range of endeavours, was remarkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also particularly appropriate, as Australia has just recently celebrated the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War during the Australia Remembers week, that we speak of Bernard Callinan, because he was the leader of the Australian Independent Company&mdash;that small group of about 300 Australian soldiers who, after the Japanese invasion of Portuguese-Timor as it then was in 1942, remained there for some considerable time as a commando unit and, according to many assessments, may well have had a significant impact in the course of the Second World War against the Japanese.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the introductory chapter to Bernard Callinan's book about those days, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent Company: The Australian Army and Portuguese-Timor 1941-1943</EMPHASIS>, Nevil Shute wrote this about that effort:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Commandos never secured a prisoner, though they tried to get one once or twice, and they never succeeded in preventing the Japanese from doing anything that they really wanted to do. They killed about fifteen hundred of the enemy for the loss of forty of their own men. They stood and fought when practically every other unit in the Far East was forced to surrender; they evacuated in good order and became operational again as a detachment in New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were one of three small forces which between them immobilised two Japanese divisions. At sea, the American submarines were operating from Fremantle against Japanese shipping with increasing success, and in the air the squadrons of the American and Australian Air Forces were operating from airfields in the Northern Territory with increasing strength. These activities, with those of the Australian Commandos in Timor, convinced the Japanese High Command that a counter offensive from Australia was in preparation. Accordingly they sent their 48th division to Timor to reinforce the existing garrison; this was an experienced division of fifteen thousand men which had served in China, the Philippines, and Java. The same anxiety later caused them to send their 5th Division, which had fought in Malaya, to the Ambon and western New Guinea area, and to form from these divisions a new army with headquarters on Ceram Island. These three small, valiant efforts on the land, the sea, and in the air, immobilised over thirty thousand Japanese troops, at what was possibly the worst time in the war for the Allies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few soldiers in history can claim to have done more than that.</PARA>
<PARA>So if Bernard Callinan's contribution and that of his men was just in the defence of Australia then he and those other members of the Independent Company should stand in the history books and the record books of this country for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bernard Callinan served Australia in many other ways, so numerous that there would be too many to list in the time available to me tonight. He was President of the Royal Humane Society. He was Chairman of the National Catholic Education Commission. He was a commissioner of the ABC, a commissioner of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, a counsellor at the University of Melbourne and Deputy Chancellor of La Trobe University, amongst a whole range of other appointments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980 Bernard Callinan delivered the Mannix lecture on that other great engineer, Sir John Monash. Towards the conclusion of his lecture he said these words about Monash which I think can equally apply to Callinan himself:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If genius is the extraordinary use of extraordinary gifts, and greatness the extraordinary use of ordinary gifts, Monash can truly be described as great. He achieved greatness essentially as an administrator, by the cultivation to a high pitch of excellence his great array of talents and virtues: a fine memory, attention to detail, energy, capacity for hard work, concentration, orderliness, commonsense and fine judgment; all joined with a temperament and constitution that enabled him to work harmoniously with colleagues, and to stand the `heat in the kitchen'.

I note that the member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) is in the House tonight and I expect he may well wish to comment on this issue at a later stage, because he certainly has something to defend with respect to his local area. In relation to the comments made by the Premier, there was an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> which stated:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His comments follow heavy criticism of bureaucrats in a speech delivered in Canberra on Tuesday night, when Mr Kennett said most federal public servants had failed to contribute to policy development and should consider "making way for a fresh approach".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kennett yesterday said the Victorian Public Service "set a clear standard" for public servants federally and in other states and proved that more could be done with fewer employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Our public servants here in Victoria are very much full partners in trying to bring about a restoration to Victoria's base. We encourage our public servants . . . to make a contribution to make sure that what we do is relevant," he said.</PARA>
<PARA>With respect to the question of the Victorian situation, it is just ridiculous. Over 40,000 people from the Victorian public sector have been put out of work over the last two years. I am sure they are wondering about what the Premier means with respect to their contribution&mdash;I suppose the contribution of taking a package, if they were lucky, or otherwise going onto the dole queues and looking for work. With the fact that there have been numerous federal public servants poached by the Victorian government, he obviously does not see all of them as being no good. And this is after a decade of reform in which the Public Service federally has played a major role in a range of government initiatives in ensuring that those initiatives were implemented properly and with the best interest of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was listening to Canberra radio talkback this morning and there were a number of public servants who rang in mostly to complain about Kennett's comments. Public servants in Victoria could not do that. If they were Victorian public servants and they were identified, they would be endangering their employment because they are not allowed to comment publicly at all. I have had public servants from the Victorian Public Service raise issues with me about state government changes with respect to education and health. But the fact is that they cannot go public on that and they are scared to go public because they know what the reaction will be. Some of them have been hauled in and asked to explain their actions. In those circumstances, it is quite ridiculous for the Premier to say, `We are working in a consultative manner, in a manner which encourages our Public Service.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The link between the opposition's policies federally and the position of the Victorian Premier is also worth commenting on. Mr Kennett in a recent interview was asked, `Have you discussed this in detail with John Howard?' Mr Kennett replied, `No, not in detail; but we've had discussions in the past. We've had discussions this morning.' Yesterday a number of points were made by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) and other ministers on this issue. I know that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has subsequently said no. I quote again from that article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Public servants have nothing to fear from an incoming Howard coalition government," Mr Howard said.</PARA>
<PARA>That is interesting. A number of times in this place and elsewhere we have had situations where the opposition has stated that there will be major cutbacks in federal government expenditure. The fact is that that is almost always going to relate to people's jobs, and it is going to be public servants' jobs. They are the ones who will be in the gun if the opposition ever gets into government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances there has to be job losses and the public servants who&mdash;again, I quote Mr Howard&mdash;have nothing to fear from an incoming Howard coalition government are facing unemployment. I think the circumstances here need to be addressed. Where are those cuts going to be? What will be the situation with respect to job losses in the federal Public Service under a Howard-led government. I think the member for Canberra ought to address that. Jobs will be gone in Canberra, jobs will be gone in Melbourne, in Sydney&mdash;right throughout Australia. And which services that we provide will be hit? Social security? Employment, education and training? Community services? Which areas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fine for the opposition to state there is nothing to fear, but it is about time they came down with some detail about what they are going to do. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) has said there will be cutbacks in the Working Nation program. What will those cutbacks be? How many jobs will go in that process? What will be the result? What will be the result for public servants, who have nothing to fear from a coalition government?

It relates to a question that I addressed in this parliament in March to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rough transcript I have of what the Prime Minister said today says, `Is it like John Howard, who had the member for Barker ask a question on Hindmarsh bridge he knew to be a complete untruth? He went in and asked the question, setting up the minister for Aboriginal affairs, saying he had disseminated information when the member for Barker was the disseminator of the information himself&mdash;and the Leader of the Opposition condoned it.' The Prime Minister then went on to say, `The Liberal Party had raised untruthfulness in this parliament to an art form over the years.' Later on he referred to what John Howard knew about it and whether he encouraged the member for Barker to put the question which he knew was predicated on a lie and an untruth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that my question to the minister for Aboriginal affairs back in March mentioned some secret attachments to a report&mdash;the Fergie report. It mentioned secret attachments, secret letters. It mentioned photocopies of those secret letters. On no occasion did it mention anything other than those secret attachments, which are now the subject of a royal commission in South Australia. Nobody has ever&mdash;until today, until the Prime Minister did here&mdash;accused me of sending those secret documents anywhere. I do not appreciate the fact that the Prime Minister uses his office to example what he said is a lie and an untruth by an untruth himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that I did, in the process of asking that question, describe the documents as being in an unregistered parcel. That is true. I said that the copies were in unsealed envelopes. The jury does not know the answer to that. I said that the secret letters were addressed to a white Australian male by the name of McLachlan. They were&mdash;both to Mr Tickner's offsider and also to me&mdash;so that is true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I admit that if I exaggerated at all I said that the documents were sent around to these people like flotsam from a wreck. But on no occasion has anybody ever accused me of sending those secret documents around, except the Prime Minister. Either he has not bothered to do the work or he himself has exampled what he said was an untruth by using one in this parliament not once but twice today. I raise the issue because in the tenor of the debate today tempers got a bit rough and I did not think I would have a chance in a personal explanation to make these points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are on the subject of untruths and lies, as we were today, lies can get around by omission. If the Prime Minister is going to throw that sort of stuff around, as the only person who seems to be ruthless enough to do it, and the going is to get as rough as that, perhaps there are a few questions he might like to answer himself. For example, he has been asked many times in this place whether his company was helping to pollute the areas up near Scone some years ago when that piggery was up there. He did not answer those questions. He has been asked in this place and in another place whether he knew that the subsequent buyer for his share would be an Indonesian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister might well address himself to the question of how the Commonwealth Bank managed, on the eve of the last election, to have a television program pulled&mdash;that is, removed&mdash;from a television station in this country which was going to be on the subject of a provision made by the Commonwealth Bank in regard to the Prime Minister's debts. He might also like to address the question of whether he or any business entity that he or his family has ever been involved in had any debt forgiven by the Commonwealth Bank or written down in the last few years while he has occupied the position of Treasurer or Prime Minister of this country. If he is so interested in the truth, let us see whether he can answer those questions. </PARA>

He has appointed anyone&mdash;in the case of Frankston, three members of the Liberal Party. They are not ex-members; they are paid up members of the Liberal Party. They are running our town at the moment. What are they doing? We will wait and see the results. I can assure you that they will be showing up soon.

Whether the men in the forces fought for these utilities or fought for the flag or for a republic&mdash;it was up to the individual. But they certainly would not have dreamt at that time that these utilities&mdash;which then belonged to them&mdash;would be sold off," Mr Towers said last week. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what is happening down there. It will happen in other states as well. The company that has bought the major share of this particular area is an American firm called Utilicorp. It is a United States company which formed part of Power Partnership, which also bought a one-third stake in Waikato Electricity at Hamilton on New Zealand's North Island in the 1990s. It is not as if it is a firm that has not been in this area before; it has bought into New Zealand. We have an area in New Zealand that we can look at to see what has happened exactly over there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wellington based consumer group, Power for our Future, surveyed 46 power firms around the country and found that, overall, privatised firms had higher prices than council owned ones. Obviously, there are still a few council owned ones in New Zealand but the privatised ones had higher prices. Spokesperson Molly Melhuish said there is a strong feeling throughout New Zealand that power companies should have remained 100 per cent locally owned. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We had predicted that the foreign owners would expect higher profits than the local power companies, and particularly the hundred-percent locally owned ones, the hundred percent trusts. That has proved to be the case, so privatisation in this country has meant higher prices and higher profits. Against that, we haven't seen the benefits yet of fancy metering.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, what she is talking about there is the propaganda that these firms put out that they will sell or lease to you a fancy meter which will cut down the amount of electricity and save on costs. That is not happening in New Zealand. It is a good example. I will be looking at it further to show the people of the peninsula exactly what is happening to their power and what will happen under this firm. As I have demonstrated in the past, this firm has abused people's goodwill. They forced a person to pay twice for an electricity reconnection because she was not able to pay the $50 in the intervening week. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No issue causes greater sensitivity and anger amongst Australian peanut growers than the import of low quality, dumped, cadmium contaminated Chinese peanuts. These Chinese peanuts have become infamous for their inconsistent appearance, poor shelf life and unattractive flavour. The Chinese imports have done substantial damage to the reputation of peanuts in this country as a tasty, nutritious, quality food.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growers have done all they can through their marketing organisation, PMB Australia, now the Peanut Co. of Australia, to stop these imports. They mounted anti-dumping action in 1992. They have had no support from the government in that regard. In fact, the National Food Authority is now considering raising the permitted levels of cadmium to allow easier imports of Chinese peanuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These imports cause considerable despair, anger and material injury to the Australian industry. Imagine the shock of the industry when a minister of this government, in the last week of the last parliamentary sittings, actually accused the peanut growers' own marketing organisation of `putting Chinese peanuts into product and then making claims that they were made in Australia'. This was a statement made by the Minister for Resources, Mr Beddall. That statement is completely false and totally without foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I drew his attention to the inaccuracy of the statement at the time but he persisted with it. He said, `No, it's not. Go back to 1992.' It has subsequently been drawn to the minister's attention that the statement is completely incorrect, yet he has taken no action whatsoever to withdraw this disgraceful slur on a leading Australian company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Peanut Marketing Board chairman at the time, Mr Jeff Rackemann, has stated publicly that the PMB has never imported Chinese peanuts. He pointed out the very obvious fact that they were leading the fight against the dumped Chinese peanuts. PMB Australia has never imported Chinese peanuts. In addition, it has never attempted to pass off foreign peanuts, imported peanuts, as a product of Australia. This point was emphasised again by the current manager of the Peanut Co., Bob Hansen. He was not the manager at the time, so he searched the company records. He has confirmed that they have never imported peanuts from China. The reason why they do not is that Chinese peanuts do not meet the health regulations. He again pointed out that PMB was leading the campaign to stop these imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman of the Burnett zone of the Queensland Graingrowers Association, Mr Trevor Rook, has also emphasised that the growers' organisation has never imported Chinese peanuts. So the minister's statements were completely false and completely inaccurate. I call on the minister to come into the chamber at the end of this adjournment debate and publicly retract his statements, to attempt to undo some of the commercial damage to the reputation of this leading company. He is aware that I am raising this matter tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hard enough to sell quality Australian peanuts on a corrupt world market without having what I regard as an irresponsible government minister seeking to blacken the reputation of the industry's leading sales organisation. The Minister for Resources must publicly retract his statement and apologise tothe PMB and to its shareholders. With these sorts of statements, one wonders about this government's standards of integrity and honesty. </PARA>
