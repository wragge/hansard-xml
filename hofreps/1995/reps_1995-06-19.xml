<PARA>This motion is intended to convey as clearly as possible to the government of France the firm condemnation by the people of Australia, acting through their representatives in this House, of the decision announced by the government of France to resume the testing of nuclear weapons at Mururoa Atoll. It also expresses our hope that the decision might yet be reversed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The president of France, President Chirac, announced the decision to resume underground nuclear testing on 13 June. He said that a program of eight tests would be conducted between September 1995 and May 1996. President Chirac said that the testing was essential in order to ensure the security, safety and reliability of France's nuclear weapons. He said that, after completing this series of tests, France would intend to sign the comprehensive test ban treaty and to rely thereafter on simulation techniques to maintain its nuclear capabilities. The decision reversed the moratorium on nuclear testing announced by President Mitterrand in 1992, a moratorium which had been widely welcomed and which&mdash;together with the earlier Matignon accords, which set up a basis for reconciliation in New Caledonia&mdash;formed the foundation on which a new cooperative partnership between France and the countries of the South Pacific was emerging. President Chirac's announcement on 13 June followed widespread speculation in France about the future of the testing program during the presidential election campaign and afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to this speculation, Australia, along with many other countries, had made known to the French government our hopes that the moratorium would be maintained. I wrote to President Chirac about this matter following earlier representations made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). The French moratorium matched separate commitments by the United States, Russian and British governments to refrain from testing. In the end, however, the French government ignored the views of the vast majority of members of the international community and decided to proceed with its program. That is an indefensible decision, and the Australian people and the Australian government condemn it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's opposition to the resumed testing of nuclear weapons by France stems from a number of concerns, of which the most fundamental is the security implications of the decision for Australia, for the South Pacific region and for the international community. The end of the Cold War, having removed the spectre of global nuclear conflict which had thrown such a dark shadow on the second half of the 20th century, gave new hope to the world that we might at last see a world free of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important signpost towards a safer world was the decision by the international community on 11 May of this year in New York to extend indefinitely the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Critical to achieving the indefinite extension of the NPT was the simultaneous negotiation and adoption by all parties to the NPT, including the nuclear weapon states, of a `declaration of principles and objectives on non-proliferation and disarmament'. This declaration included, centrally, a commitment to the goal of nuclear disarmament, with the ultimate objective of the total elimination of nuclear weapons. It gave encouragement to the further development of nuclear weapon free zones, and it said that one important measure towards the elimination of nuclear weapons was the early conclusion&mdash;in fact, no later than 1996&mdash;of a comprehensive test ban treaty. Pending the entry into force of a test ban treaty, the nuclear weapon states were committed to exercise `utmost restraint'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French decision clearly contradicts this undertaking. `Utmost restraint' on nuclear testing cannot possibly comprehend a program of eight tests. The decision is certain to raise in the minds of non-nuclear weapons states questions about the good faith of all the nuclear weapons states. It will add to the negotiating difficulties over the comprehensive test ban treaty. France's action might well provide a convenient excuse for others who might want to join the nuclear club and who will now argue that the commitment of the nuclear weapons states to the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons is a sham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a critical time for the world. The Cold War has ended but what will shape our future security and prosperity is still uncertain. We are moulding the building blocks of that now. It is particularly important that all governments<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS>work together to ensure that the international system we have in the 21st century is one that suits all of us better than the one we have had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French decision is a narrow decision, made according to a narrow definition of narrowly French interests. It defies world opinion, but that is the only bold thing about it&mdash;that is, the fact that it defies world opinion is its only defining thing. In every other sense it betrays timidity. It is an act of retreat; it is not an act of engagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said on 15 June, why should a country of such substance undertake this program? What is there to fear in cooperative engagement with the rest of the world? What will best protect the French people is not a 1990s version of the Maginot line but participation in the global dialogue. The French government claims that this nuclear capacity&mdash;this force de frappe&mdash;is a deterrent, but in the post Cold War world a deterrent to what? It is certainly no deterrent against the greatest nuclear threats to Europe and the world now, including the emergence of new nuclear weapons states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">France, by its inflammatory action with regard to its testing program, now runs the greater risk of losing international support, both moral and material, for cleaning up the rotting carcasses of the old Soviet reactors, whose presence still hangs over Europe and France like a pall. This is one of France's and Europe's greatest challenges. These dangers, like the stockpiles of degrading nuclear weapons and weapons systems, and contaminated nuclear sites, cannot be deterred through the further development of an offensive nuclear weapon capability. These considerations are international in scope. They also shape Australia's opposition to nuclear testing by China. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By anybody who resumes. But Australia and the other members of the South Pacific Forum have a particular concern with French testing because it is being conducted not in France's metropolitan territory but in the South Pacific. Most countries in this region are small island states. For many years they have made clear their opposition to nuclear weapons. They have shown this year after year in the resolutions of the South Pacific Forum and, most clearly, in the creation of the South Pacific nuclear-free zone. The government of France is defying not only their wishes but their moral rights. This action will call into question for many in the South Pacific the legitimacy of the French presence there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French government has defended the environmental safety of the tests at Mururoa and it has alluded to the possibility that international scientists might observe the tests. But the fact is that accidents happen and no-one can foresee the longer term dangers associated with possible leakage from the underground coral structures housing the tests. The fact remains that, if these tests are perfectly safe, they could be made perfectly well in France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Condemnation of the French decision has not been confined to the 15 members of the South Pacific Forum. Critical statements have been issued by Belgium, Chile, Denmark, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Kenya, Luxembourg, Mexico, Norway, Peru, the Philippines, Korea, Russia, South Africa, and Switzerland. On 15 June the European Parliament in Strasbourg adopted a resolution expressing shock at the decision and urging France to reconsider. Canada and the United States have regretted the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's response has been strong and unequivocal. The government has deplored the decision. We have frozen defence relations with France and we will not engage in any defence activity which would in any way assist the testing program. We have protested against the French decision in the International Atomic Energy Agency board of governors meeting in Vienna, and other international bodies, including the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva and the United Nations in New York. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a particular responsibility in this matter this year because we are chair of the South Pacific Forum. I have been in close touch with my forum colleagues about it. On their behalf, I issued a statement condemning the decision and expressing our unequivocal opposition to it. I said that forum leaders hoped that France will hear and take note of what the world is saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make sure that France does hear, we proposed to send a delegation of members of the South Pacific Forum to Paris to put the views of forum countries directly and unambiguously to the French government. Because of the limited time available, and in accordance with forum practice, the delegation comprises the past, present and next forum chairs. So Senator Evans is leading the delegation. He is accompanied by President Bernard Dowiyogo of Nauru and Mr Tsiamilili, a special envoy from the government of Papua New Guinea, which takes over the forum chair in September. The New Zealand minister for justice, Mr Graham, and the Western Samoan minister of education, Ms Fiami, are also represented on the delegation, as is the secretary general of the forum, the Hon. Ieremiah Tabai. The delegation will meet the French government later tonight, Paris time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passing of this resolution by the House will assist it to convey to the French government the depth of forum countries' concerns. When the delegation reports back on the results of its discussions early tomorrow morning, I plan to be in touch again quickly with my forum colleagues about what next steps we will take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns of the Australian people about the French decision have been demonstrated clearly over recent days. I hope they will continue to be expressed and in ways which help bring home to the French government how widespread is the opposition to these policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, Mr Speaker, some important things need to be remembered in this debate and some have been lost sight of. The government's position in this matter&mdash;and I believe the position of most Australians&mdash;is not shaped by hostility towards France or the French people, or to France's role in the Pacific. It is shaped solely by our opposition to this specific policy of the government of France to resume testing nuclear weapons in the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">French people and Australians who have come from France have made a valuable contribution to Australia. I have spoken before of the opportunities which exist for French business in Australia and for Australian businesses in France. I have also said that we welcome constructive French participation in the South Pacific.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that the expressions of Australian concern about this French policy do not flow over into racist attacks on France or French people. It is this particular French government policy which we object to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for Australians to remember that many French people object to this decision as well. A number of members of the French delegation to the European Parliament voted in favour of the resolution I referred to earlier. I am sure that all members of this House will share the view that terrorist acts, like the arson reported to be the cause of the fire at the office of the Honorary French Consul in Perth on 17 June, must be utterly rejected and condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a very sorry consequence if our opposition to an act which contravenes our every sense of fairness, democracy and decency should erode these values in our own society. Such acts as that which occurred in Perth the government utterly condemns as both illegal and un-Australian. Such acts are not only objectionable but also counterproductive to our cause. Those with influential positions in the community, in politics and in the media must be aware of their responsibilities&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not diminish our resentment of the French decision to understand exactly what it entails.

Our arguments will be more persuasive if they are based on reality and not irrational fear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I doubt if there is any Australian who does not feel anger about the French decision. What we must take to the French government is a collective concerted response&mdash;the response of all the Australian people channelled through the best means available to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision to resume testing is a bad decision by the government of France. It is bad because it endangers progress towards a world free of nuclear weapons. It is bad because it ignores the views of the people of the region in which the tests are being conducted. It is bad because it sets back so far the cause of constructive French participation in the South Pacific region. It is bad because it is a decision which is essentially self-absorbed rather than showing a wider vision. It is important that this parliament, representing the people of Australia, convey clearly to the government of France the extent of our concern at its wilful and unnecessary decision. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commence my remarks by saying that the opposition completely agrees with everything set out in the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I also very strongly associate the Liberal and National parties with the condemnation of the act of wilful destruction that occurred in Perth over the weekend. It was an un-Australian act and an act that was calculated to bring into this debate an element that all of us would wish to be kept out. But, most significantly of all, such behaviour is counterproductive to the very cause of registering the depth of anger and feeling Australians have on this particular issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument Australians have is with the decision of the French government. We do not have an argument with the French people. Australia has long ties of history and sacrifice with France. Because of that, there are few countries in the world that have as much right to speak bluntly to the French government as has Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the sacrifices of Australians in defence of France have very few parallels in history. If there is one country to which we do have a right to express to its government and people in very blunt, unapologetic and frank terms our anger, condemnation and contempt for the behaviour of that government, it is France. But, in doing that, I emphasise that our argument is with the political decision of the French government. I share to the full the Prime Minister's concern that it not be a general anger directed at ordinary French people or at Australians of French descent living in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision of the French government to resume nuclear tests in the Pacific was a particularly insensitive decision; a decision that ran counter to the events of world history over the past few years. To many Australians&mdash;indeed to many people around the world&mdash;it must have seemed as though time had stood still for President Chirac and for those people in the French government who were responsible for the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is as though the momentous events of the late 1980s and the early 1990s&mdash;which, first of all, brought the end to Soviet hegemony over eastern Europe and, ultimately, led to the disintegration of the Soviet Union and to the end of the Cold War&mdash;had completely passed the French President and his colleagues by. It is as though for them time had really stood still. I am sure that to many young Australians, in particular, the decision of the French government must have seemed particularly insensitive, anachronistic and brutishly out of touch with the drift of world opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years we have grown used to hearing talk about the peace dividend&mdash;in other words, the consequences for the world with the end of the Cold War, with expenditure on armaments being directed to other things, with the removal from the nations of the world of the awful implications of living on the balance of the nuclear terror that was a function of the Cold War. But of all the dividends of that peace, I dare say that most Australians&mdash;indeed, most people around the world&mdash;would have imagined that the greatest dividend of all was the belief that, long term, the threat of nuclear war and nuclear holocaust had been removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, whatever technical justification or complicated theoretical reasons may be advanced by the French government, the very fact that a nation known for its civility and for its enormous contribution to Western civilisation should be so against the background of that peace dividend and should be so insensitive to world opinion as to propose these tests was not only particularly disappointing but also, in my judgment and, I am sure, in the judgment of all people in this House, justifies the very strong reactions of disgust and revulsion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition comes to this debate sharing all of the concerns that have been expressed by the Prime Minister. I think this is one of those occasions where it is possible to say that right across the spectrum of Australian opinion&mdash;people who support the government and people who support the coalition&mdash;there was an instantaneous explosion of anger. Many of us would have to acknowledge that in our political experience in recent years there has rarely been an event which has brought forth such an instantaneous expression of hostility and rejection. More than anything else, there is a sentiment of bewilderment and amazement that, given the end of the Cold War and the changed circumstances that exist in the world at the present time, a nation with the record of civilisation and civility that the French nation has could possibly have made this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I think I would be failing in my duty as Leader of the Opposition, and I would be failing in my duty in speaking on behalf of a significant section of the Australian population, if I did not again express my absolute amazement at the pathetically inadequate response of Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). However much the foreign minister may have been subsequently justified, nothing can alter the fact that the language used by him in his press conference in Tokyo was not the language of somebody expressing the justified outrage of the Australian people. It was the language of somebody bringing a technically balanced and academic approach to an international problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where Senator Evans was wrong. It might have been the language of somebody who might aspire to high office in the United Nations but it was not the language of somebody who was properly expressing the concern or the outrage of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me read to you what he actually said after having taken his obligatory swipe at his opposite number and after having lapsed overseas into domestic politics. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we're talking about here are the proportionate responses to the nature of the decision that France has made. We deplore the decision. We are disappointed by it. At the same time, we do acknowledge the context in which these tests will be taking place is really very different from that in which they have taken place in the past.</PARA>
<PARA>I will borrow the words of one of his predecessors. When the now Governor-General, Bill Hayden, was Australia's foreign minister he warned us once that words were bullets in diplomacy and in foreign policy. They can also be bullets in terms of the grossly excessive impact they can have on the opinion of the world, or the opinion of individual countries, but their lack of force could also have an equally big impact on the interests of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our complaint is that, in those remarks, Senator Evans failed to capture the mood of anger, disgust and rejection of the Australian people. Worse than that, he basically said to the French government, `We're upset about it but we really understand why you're doing it.' That is where he let the Australian interests down, and all of you sitting opposite know that he failed Australia lamentably last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his failure to express the legitimate anger of the Australian people on that occasion, and in his taking of that extraordinarily academic approach&mdash;an approach that did not capture the community mood&mdash;he failed the basic test of somebody who represented the interests of the Australian nation overseas. His remarks even produced this interesting response from one of the journalists, who asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are you saying that the French decision to go ahead then is not as bad as what it could have been?</PARA>
<PARA>The senator replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exactly.</PARA>
<PARA>What kind of message did that send to President Chirac? Senator Evans's visit to France at the present time, as a result of these remarks, is next to useless. Having given that initial tickle-my-tummy, weak, limp response, the foreign minister has basically telegraphed and conveyed to the French government and to the French people that, no matter what he now says, no matter what the Prime Minister now says and no matter what anybody opposite now says, we really do understand that this particular decision is not quite as bad as it might have been; that the context is different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To use that kind of language over something as serious as this is absolutely to betray the Australian people and to translate to the French government an academic and internationally academic acceptance of the broad diplomatic reasons as to why the French government might want to carry out these tests. The foreign minister then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think you've just got to keep these things in proportion. We are talking about underground tests here. We are not talking about atmospheric tests and as such the health implications of that remains to be proven beyond doubt that there is a serious and widespread impact.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in his initial press conference, he has tried to paint a benign context for the carrying out of these tests. That is the failure of the foreign minister of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I agree with everything the Prime Minister has said&mdash;and there is nothing the Prime Minister said that anybody could possibly have taken exception to&mdash;I took exception to what many on this side of the House, and what many on your side of the House, also took exception to, and that is the initially weak, indifferent response of the foreign minister. An attempt has been made by the Prime Minister to engage in a bit of catch-up politics&mdash;</PARA>

But then in a mealy-mouthed way he went on to attack the foreign minister, seeking to deny unanimity of view in the parliament about this proposal&mdash;that is, after having initially agreed with the response by the foreign minister, he shifted his position, as he was told by his party or his advertising agency, because he thought there was a shift in popular and public sentiment. So the Leader of the Opposition came out supportive of the government after Senator Evans's remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If members of the public want an indication of where the Leader of the Opposition is coming from, they need to go back only to the remarks I referred to.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should they stop testing it?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard: Well, that's a difficult issue. I certainly don't go as far as the Government does on that.</PARA>

Only he could downgrade this quite important and momentous occasion of the federal parliament by bringing out this very shabby dimension.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I make the point that those French-Australians deserve a fair go. The target of this is the President of France, Jacques Chirac. The target of this is the government of France and its disgraceful decision to resume nuclear testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just happen to have in my hand a brochure from the most recent French election campaign, and it is very relevant to this debate and this decision. On the front cover it says, `Jacques Chirac la France pour tous'&mdash;`France for all'. You might say he was referring to French electors. Hopefully, he might have been referring to mankind as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going over to the back page of this brochure, I quote the last line in, I must admit, my not too good French, `respecte dans le monde', the accurate quotation of which is&mdash;taking into account what he said in the rest of this paragraph&mdash;`and with respect for all in the world'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This election manifesto of Jacques Chirac spoke of `respect for all in the world'. There is no respect in this decision by France to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Indeed, it creates the circumstance where Jacques Chirac henceforth ought to be known as `Dark Jacques' for the heavy shadow that this totally unwarranted nuclear activity places over his incumbency as President of France and for the regression into the bitter attitudes of the Cold War that his action suggests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing we need as the world approaches a new century is a return to the dark ages of nuclear stand-off. Yet that is exactly the way France is heading the world. There is no justification whatsoever when you examine in detail the utterances of the French President and other French spokesmen. There is no excuse. Their decision simply does not stand up. These people, the French government, spent some 25 years exploding atmospheric and underground nuclear weapons in the South Pacific until this was ceased by a decision of President Mitterrand in 1992. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Bilney" NAMEID="RE4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And, the minister concedes, France ceased testing back in 1992. I take on board, in the spirit of getting some sense into this debate, the view put forward, but it was reaffirmed by President Mitterrand with that decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we to believe that the French really need additional nuclear testing, an additional eight explosions over the course of the next 11 months? Do they need more technical information to better their information bank with regard to the whole concept of atom bombs and nuclear testing? Let me just dwell on this particular point, because I think it is relevant to the debate. In one sense it could be said that, after 25 years, after all their computer programming, all their scientific endeavour, France has&mdash;and it is probably the equivalent of many times this&mdash;a million megabytes of computer capacity of information on French nuclear testing. If they have eight more tests&mdash;though I hope they will change their minds&mdash;that might produce one more megabyte. So their computer capacity of information will be going from one million megabytes to one million and one megabytes before they eventually cease to test for all time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply say to the House: that does not stack up; they do not need even one more megabyte of information, let alone one million megabytes, with regard to nuclear testing, given all the testing they have done and the damage they have done already in the Southern Hemisphere. It is time that France went back to the drawing board and reviewed this decision very carefully indeed. Not only is the testing of a bomb in the Pacific something which will cause a major backlash in Australia and New Zealand but that backlash will continue for a long time to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fear all of this, in essence, is nothing more than a public relations stunt. It is all about the glory of France, a new president embarking on his presidency; it is little about scientific endeavour or building up additional nuclear information. It was a very convenient decision for President Jacques Chirac to take, and it will be one he will eventually come to regret. For whatever reason he has made this decision, we must now take the fight in very strong terms to the government of France, and to the President of France to get him to review this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does give me a certain satisfaction that, so strong has been the reaction of the peoples of the South Pacific and even of some people in France to this action&mdash;as the Prime Minister alluded to&mdash;Chirac's callous and cruelly cynical decision will backfire not only in a commercial sense but also in the sort of leadership that a modern day France ought to display to the world. A France which over the last century gave the world so many advances in the health field, so many advances in technology, be it in rail transport or whatever, and so many cultural advances is now a France which, against the very statement in President Chirac's brochure, is going to turn its back on the rest of the world and proceed down this particular path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope Chirac has ultimately misjudged the mood of his own people. I hope that that will cause him to reconsider for domestic political French reasons as opposed to and quite apart from the reaction of the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what was our government's response to all of this? I would make the additional point: we were very slow off the mark. The quote of the Leader of the Opposition was a quote made at the doorstop interview early in the day on arrival at the Cairns shadow cabinet meeting, which I attended. Even in that quote the Leader of the Opposition kept the options open. He was reviewing the unfolding situation, and his quote from last Tuesday in Cairns should have been seen in that perspective. But to go back to further mislead, as the Prime Minister did, is very disgraceful and I think he will regret that also in setting the debate off in this particular way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the French have dismissed subsequent Australian concern with just a shrug of the shoulder. They seized on the horrific fire in Perth&mdash;and I very much regret that act of arson against the French consulate in Perth. They read of the first reaction of our foreign minister, and they read between the lines; they read clearly enough the reaction of a government that really did not care to rock the boat while France literally rocked the Pacific and the rest of the world. That is what I really regret&mdash;that the Australian government on this issue did not come out boxing more quickly in a more coordinated way and with a more comprehensive approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government's own lack of protest was not bad enough, no less a person than the Prime Minister sought to denigrate members of the opposition who did demonstrate a fitting sense of outrage over the French decision. So we had more name calling by the Prime Minister&mdash;name calling which Australian politics could well do without, particularly when dealing with issues of great substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think our amendment to the motion will add strength to the Australian position. So let the government, just this once, take on board what the coalition has put before it. We are prepared to support every word of the government's motion, and the government should indicate that it is prepared to support every word of our amendment. We will then have a unanimous decision by, hopefully, both houses of this parliament, on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to close by saying a few words to those people in the Australian community who feel the greatest outrage over French testing and the greatest outrage over their own government's lack of action, those people who have taken direct action and have taken part in protests around the country. I say to them that I know how they feel&mdash;that they are annoyed at and angered by the French government and they are annoyed at and angered by their government's failure to make their protest more effective. I know that many will express their feelings by boycotting the purchase of French goods. I certainly cannot blame them for expressing themselves in that way. But I appeal to them not to confuse actions of legitimate, non-violent protest with taking violent action of any kind. I reject any move towards violent demonstration and urge them to proceed with peaceful demonstration and no violent action whatsoever. In that way we can build a grand coalition of opposition right across Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific against this incredible decision by France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people have been let down by the President of France. These people have been let down by the response of their government. These people are entitled to put their view in a positive and peaceful way. It is our obligation to see that that view, in turn, is put on the floor of this parliament. That is why the coalition supports the motion before the chair. That is why the coalition takes the additional step of arguing, quite properly in all the circumstances, for the recall of the Australian Ambassador to France, and for new instructions, as a reflection of our protest over the French government's decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit sad but it is a matter of fact that the Kenyan nation has recalled its ambassador from Canberra in the last few days, over a lesser matter. We should be prepared to have the courage and the decisiveness, as part of our approach, to instruct the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, to bring back, on the same flight to Australia, the Australian Ambassador to France. This would be a very sharp reflection that there is some strength and some backbone in the Australian response to the French government decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want a proper course of action arising from this French government decision. We want to remind President Chirac of his own election statement that he would have respect for all the world. We want France to reconsider and for the government to adopt both the motion before the chair and the amendment as being the correct way forward to deal with this disgraceful decision by France, which I again condemn. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the previous speaker, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), that it would be a pity should grandstanding in this place be allowed to obscure the great measure of agreement that there is between government and opposition about this announcement by France that it will resume nuclear testing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will start by looking at some of the points made in the opposition's amendment, which we have undertaken to consider. I do deplore the lack of courtesy involved in not giving prior notice of it. Many of the points made in it are points which the government has acted on. They are adornments to the proposed resolution rather than substantive additions to it. The amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Join with New Zealand and suspend military cooperation with France; except for surveillance, United Nations and humanitarian activities.</PARA>
<PARA>Effectively, that is what we are doing by refusing to refuel military flights through Australia which have anything to do with supporting, directly or indirectly, testing at Mururoa. That applies to the next point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cease refuelling all French non-humanitarian military transit flights.</PARA>
<PARA>The next point requires the government to recall the Australian Ambassador for various purposes, one of which is to develop in association with the South Pacific Forum a regional plan of action to embarrass and if possible hinder French nuclear testing. Our consultations with nations of the South Pacific Forum are close and continuing. It is for that reason that Australia has orchestrated a protest to France on behalf of the 15 nations of the South Pacific Forum and has led that delegation through the person of the foreign minister, who is now in Paris. Another point reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">including action in the United Nations condemning French nuclear testing . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is a measure of the ignorance of the opposition that it does not know that that action has already been taken. Our Ambassador to the United Nations, Mr Richard Butler, has delivered to the Secretary-General a message on behalf of the South Pacific countries represented in the United Nations precisely to that effect. The final point reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discuss with the USA the possibility of data sharing to remove the public French excuse for the tests.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is something which has been explored by me, including with the French. To make out that these are substantial and far-reaching additional actions which are being urged upon the government is to make out something which is not true. Unfortunately, it is that meretriciousness that has characterised the opposition's approach to this debate from the very beginning. We appreciate its support. But it would be nice to see it given freely and it would be nice to see it given in a less pettifogging way than has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement that France would resume nuclear testing has provoked extremely widespread international indignation, and in the South Pacific&mdash;the area for which as minister for Pacific island affairs I have a particular responsibility&mdash;bitterness and outrage. The countries of the South Pacific Forum have expressed their deep resentment and opposition to this decision. That bitterness and resentment are the more compelling as they come from a part of the world where people take pride in their traditions of respect for the views of others&mdash;a respect which has not been shown by France on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are very good reasons why the countries of the Pacific feel a particular sense of outrage and why Australia, as the proposed resolution says, shares that sense. For the Pacific, this is not a decision which has been taken by a distant power and which has merely distant effects. The decision to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific is a decision to try out an abhorrent weapon&mdash;a weapon the long-term effects of which both on people and on the environment are not known but are greatly feared&mdash;in a part of the world which has a very deep affinity with the natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pacific countries, as many in the House would know, regard themselves as the custodians of that environment for future generations. By introducing an element of doubt about the safety of that environment, France is imperilling the birthright of the Pacific countries. Those countries are tiny. They have not had the power, the influence, the economic levers or the population to convince France not to continue testing. That is another element of the outrage that is so widely felt&mdash;that this is a decision of a powerful country taken against the interests of a group which has a very small voice in world affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These countries have a total population of around six million. However, without Papua New Guinea and Fiji, there are less than a million. The nearest country to the tests is the Cook Islands, with a population of some 20,000. Nauru, whose president is part of the delegation now in Paris, has a population of 10,000. So it is clear that it is a David and Goliath situation&mdash;an imbalance&mdash;which was very much at the centre of the decision by a number of Pacific countries to seek greater strength through more unity by establishing the organisation which now represents them. The first South Pacific Forum met in Wellington in 1971, the original members being Fiji, Western Samoa, Cook Islands, Tonga, New Zealand, Nauru and Australia. It has since expanded to include all independent countries in the South Pacific. This year, the forum will be welcoming the latest of them, Palau. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nuclear testing was then and is now very much at the centre of the forum's concerns. It is instructive to return to that foundation year&mdash;1971&mdash;to realise just how abiding and how deeply felt the Pacific's concern with French testing has been. The final communique drew attention to the forthcoming series of nuclear tests to be conducted by France in the South Pacific. Participants expressed their deep regret that the tests, which were then conducted in the atmosphere, continued to be held in the islands of French Polynesia, despite the partial test ban treaty and the protests repeatedly made by a number of countries. The forum addressed an urgent appeal that the then current test series&mdash;remember, this is 1971&mdash;should be the last in the Pacific. France ignored that appeal and, 32 years after it was made, has still not signed the partial test ban treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">French testing in the atmosphere ceased in 1974. Why did it cease? It ceased because the Labor government, in consultation with New Zealand, took the French to the International Court of Justice. The French, as a result of that action, withdrew from testing in the atmosphere. However, it continued testing underground from 1975 to 1991. Since that time, France has conducted altogether 192 tests, 175 of which have been in the South Pacific&mdash;44 in the atmosphere and 131 underground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At last year's forum in Brisbane, there was perhaps some scope for optimism that the cessation of testing would be permanent. The forum welcomed the extension by the United States of its moratorium on testing and the continuation by other nuclear weapons states, except China, of their testing moratoriums. It tackled the issue of French testing very specifically by saying that, if France were to cease testing permanently, that would contribute significantly to improving the relations between France and forum countries. Conversely, the forum noted that any resumption of testing would be a major setback to the `current positive trends in relations between France and the region'. Unfortunately, the cautionary tone of that final statement has been borne out by subsequent events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that it was with a very deep sense of personal disappointment that I learned that France had taken the decision to resume testing. One could always hope that good sense, a sense of responsibility and of understanding of the views of others, would prevail in France. Indeed, we can still have some hope that the French will better understand the depth of the Pacific's concerns when confronted with them directly by the forum mission which has been talking to them in Paris. We must continue to urge France to reconsider its decision, to assume a sense of international leadership on the issue, and to be in fact, as well as in rhetoric, the constructive participant in Pacific affairs which it has claimed to be&mdash;indeed, in recent years it has been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the sense&mdash;to my disappointment, it has proved to be wrong&mdash;that France was continuing to move towards a more positive and constructive role in the Pacific. It has shown considerable willingness to cooperate with Pacific countries in a wide range of activities&mdash;from maritime surveillance operations directed at detecting illegal fishing activities, and thereby helping to protect one of the region's most valuable resources, to an arrangement concluded with Australia and New Zealand in 1992 to coordinate responses to natural disasters in the region and to provide development assistance to the region of around $20 million a year in addition to the resources it provides for its own territories. So it is a constructive participant, including in the region's largest program delivery organisation&mdash;the South Pacific Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because those elements of France's relations with the Pacific&mdash;and this goes to some of the points in the amendment&mdash;remain a benefit to the Pacific countries themselves that we would like them to continue, even if the overall tone of relations has been soured. It is also because these activities are of benefit to the tiny countries of the South Pacific that we believe our own involvement in them should continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to New Caledonia. The House will recall that New Caledonia was the focus of great discontent and conflict in the Pacific not so long ago and the scene of quite dreadful bloodshed. The process which was set in train under the Matignon accords in 1988 has achieved great progress in reconciling political attitudes and in setting the political and economic basis for a referendum on the status of the territory in 1998. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot needs to be done to bring about that solution. I urge France to continue with the process in a constructive and positive way. We still look to France to ensure a peaceful evolution in 1998, even though France's relations with the region will be set back by the resumption of testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope I have managed to express some of the background to the deep disappointment and heartfelt regret that many in the Pacific feel about France's announcement. France has acted in a high-handed manner, disregarding many of the values which Pacific countries hold dear. That is why forum countries have unanimously supported Australia, unanimously supported the efforts of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as forum chair and unanimously supported his statement condemning the French announcement. It is also why forum members, at very short notice and at the expense of business at home, went to France to participate in the forum mission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We urge France to heed the call of the South Pacific Forum. This is our region. It is precious to us. If France participates as a positive and constructive partner in the region and its development, it will be welcomed. But I say to France, `Please don't visit on the region an abhorrent technology which is so much at odds with the way life is lived in the Pacific.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment specifically on the matters raised in the opposition's amendment. The Prime Minister made clear in his speech that the passing of this motion would assist the forum delegation which is now in Paris to convey to the French government the depth and intensity of the concerns forum countries have about the decision to resume nuclear testing. He said that, when the delegation reported on the results of its discussions, he would be in touch again quickly with his forum colleagues about the next steps we would take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial response from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was a totally unfair attack on the leader of the forum delegation, Senator Gareth Evans. The effect of that&mdash;by accident or design&mdash;was to undermine the authority of the delegation and the forum's approach. That response seems to me to have been shaped by the narrowest perceptions of political advantage, not at doing what is necessary to advance the critical national and regional interests that are at stake here. As the Prime Minister said, the government will wait until the forum delegation meets the French government. That will be the time to discuss with forum countries the next steps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me to be quite wrong and bad that, with this cheap point scoring which the Leader of the Opposition, in particular, has gone on with, we should have the effect of pre-empting whatever happens in Paris and whatever the French reaction may be. So much of the pettifogging activities which are described in the amendment&mdash;those that are not more substantial and serious&mdash;really seem to be solely for the purpose of point scoring. The government rejects the amendment, unless and until it is made of value by whatever comes out of the discussions in Paris. </PARA>

That is the corridor talk. They just do not have the guts to say it properly. Sorry, one member does: the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). The President of the Australian Labor Party did the right thing. He came out and attacked Senator Evans for his response to this decision by the French government. He embarrassed the Labor Party but reflected the views that I and the Leader of the Opposition had been expressing on behalf of the people of Australia.

On 15 May, which I think was a Monday, we had the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, sitting down with Leon Brittan, the European commissioner responsible for, amongst other things, external relations. If the Australian government was concerned about the resumption of French nuclear testing, would you not have thought that at that meeting Senator McMullan would have said to the European commissioner, responsible after all for the European Union's external relations, that this was an issue of concern to the Australian government? If you look at the record of that conversation, which I have done, you will notice that Senator McMullan did not mention the issue. It was never mentioned.

Plucky little New Zealand, a smaller country than Australia, no doubt with more to lose than Australia, has had the guts to go out and protest strongly over this, but Australia hasn't. The Australian people may have, but the Australian government has not. In doing so the government has let down the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There you will have Senator Evans sweeping into the Quai d'Orsay trying to pump up his rhetoric a little but with the French foreign minister sitting there with a transcript of the Tokyo press conference.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is Senator Evans concerned about France in that context? It is because the Security Council ultimately has to approve the next Secretary-General and France is a permanent member of the Security Council and has a veto.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No wonder his response to this incredibly important issue has been so weak and so flippant. This is a challenge to our national interest. When our national interest has been directly challenged, the government has simply dropped the ball. We have moved an amendment here today. If that amendment is opposed by the Labor Party, then any claim by the Labor Party that it is taking a strong stand&mdash;any claim of that kind&mdash;will simply be proven to be as hollow as it sounds. If the Labor Party votes for our amendment, we will concede that it has caught up and understood the importance of this issue to the Australian people.

Broadly speaking, this House would condemn Senator Evans because he has undermined Australia's effort, he has undermined the credibility of Australia's protest.

A good indication of that is that the shadow foreign minister, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), spent 10 of his 15 minutes attacking the government on this matter instead of talking about the people who have made the decision that has caused this debate: the government of Jacques Chirac. We should be targeting our venom towards his government today. I highlight one of the points that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made: we should not be targeting French people; we should be targeting the people who make up the government of France because it is their decision that is going to have such an impact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look at the short history of this debate today. The Prime Minister moved a very strong motion in this place condemning the government of France for its decision to resume nuclear testing. In a statesmanlike address he outlined all of the reasons why Australia took that strong position and why we are opposed to the testing of nuclear weapons. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) got up, said that he supported everything the Prime Minister had to say, said that he supported the motion, and then spent 10 minutes attacking the government. It has been the Leader of the Opposition that has brought politics into this debate, and it is a great disappointment to me that, instead of having a unified motion and unified debate that shows the people of Australia and the people of France that this parliament is unified in its opposition to the decision to test nuclear weapons in our region&mdash;instead of having a bipartisan political position&mdash;the opposition leader and his cohorts have decided that they are going to engage in a cheap political point scoring exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the opposition leader and his cohorts think that the government will gain a lot of credibility through this campaign against the French nuclear tests and that they are trying to undermine the government's credibility on this issue. One just has to look back over 20 years of history at our opposition to nuclear testing in the South Pacific: it has been the Australian Labor Party that has shown the leadership every year and every step of the way. The Prime Minister highlighted that in his response to the amendment when he outlined how the Leader of the Opposition back in 1985 was attacking the Labor government for its position of opposing nuclear testing and how the Leader of the Opposition said that we should not be anti-French, that our position as a Labor government was one of attacking the French government and that the French had legitimate reasons to test nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have not changed their position. The only reason they are trying to become more vociferous in this campaign and out-point score the government is that they believe they can get some cheap political advantage from this debate. They should be condemned for that action. They have destroyed the effectiveness of having a unified parliamentary motion and parliamentary debate on this matter. That is something the people of Australia should be very disappointed about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One just has to look at the statesmanlike speech that the Prime Minister made. Throughout his introductory speech he did not make one criticism or one comment about the opposition's position or the cheap point scoring. He just stated on behalf of the people of Australia why we are opposed to nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Then the opposition leader decided it was too good a speech: he had to try to tear it down. That is a great disappointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the reasons why we are opposed to testing in the South Pacific and why we on this side of the House totally condemn the French government for its decision. One of the major reasons is the total hypocrisy of the French government on this issue. Just a few weeks ago in New York the representatives of the government of France supported the indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. I see in the chamber my colleague the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who, like myself, was a participant in some of the negotiations and discussions that occurred about that indefinite extension to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people, through their representatives at the United Nations, fully supported the indefinite extension of that treaty, as did the government of the people of France. The people of France said that they supported the indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. I will read a couple of clauses from that. Clause 4(a) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The completion by the Conference on Disarmament of the negotiations on a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty no later than 1996. Pending the entry into force of a Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, the nuclear-weapon States should exercise utmost restraint . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The French government supported that resolution and this is the way it is exercising utmost restraint: it is going to start a series of eight tests in a few months time in our very region. Another clause in the resolution states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons, and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.</PARA>
<PARA>That is another clause in the resolution that the nuclear weapons states, including France, and all the non-nuclear weapons states endorsed at the nuclear non-proliferation treaty negotiations in May this year in New York. France supported this resolution. Now, with the utmost hypocrisy, it has decided to go against that decision and to recommence further testing of its nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The President of France, in justifying his decision, lied to the people of France and to the people of the world. He said, `There are no dangers to the people of the world from nuclear testing.' What utter rubbish! There is absolute and complete evidence that the testing of nuclear weapons, even the underground testing of nuclear weapons, imposes major health risks and major environmental risks to the region in which those tests are done. There is very clear and overwhelming evidence that the test program will cause environmental damage to the South Pacific and thereby to the whole world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The testing has caused fracturing and fissuring of the atolls in which they are conducted. There are fears that radioactivity is now already leaking into the marine environment. Continued testing on the damaged atolls will further threaten the geology of the area and could lead to a major radioactive leak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that there are some 25 million people living in the region of these tests who will be directly affected by the environmental damage that these tests will do. It is absolutely crucial that the people of France understand that there are 25 million fellow human beings, who have no argument with the people of France, who are not in any sort of war with France or who are not trying to claim some French territory or French possession, living in the South Pacific region who are going to suffer environmental damage and health damage because of France's decision to recommence testing of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My plea is to the people of France to say to their government, `Enough is enough. We do not need these further tests.' I ask: why does France need to test further nuclear weapons? Who is the enemy of the people of France? Who is the enemy that they need this huge nuclear arsenal to protect themselves from? The Cold War is over. The Soviet Union and all its satellite states that were there as a huge threat to them have gone. Most of those satellite states are now democratic countries. The Soviet Union no longer exists. Those people have been freed from that communist control and are now living in democratic countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no physical threat to France&mdash;in Europe or elsewhere. There is no need for nuclear weapons by France.

The opposition, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and other speakers have said, supports this motion without qualification. Without being too flippant about what is a very serious situation, the most appropriate analogy in this case is the drunk who is about to have his last drink and become a reformed drunk. He says, `Of course, I have got a case of scotch in the bar which I need to drink first.' That is a bit like what we have in relation to this nuclear testing situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put on the public record the degree to which the French have been testing in the Pacific since 1966. There have been 185 tests of devices in that area of the world. About 177 of those have been since 1966. In 1989 there was a ban on large weapons on Mururoa. There were suggestions, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) said, of fissures being developed in the islands, and lagoon four, as a result of those large weapon tests. It therefore was not surprising that in 1992 then President Mitterrand decided that testing should be discontinued, which in hindsight and with forethought was a very commendable decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent decision by President Chirac is therefore something which we should abhor. The decision is a wrong one. It is wrong for the French people; it is wrong for the world at large. It is an immoral decision. It is an immoral decision simply because the French, as the honourable member for Moreton has said, were very instrumental in the indefinite extension of the NPT in New York only last month. To now turn around and do exactly what they are doing is totally immoral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision is also unnecessary and it is anachronistic. It is unnecessary and anachronistic in the sense of the force de frappe that has been mentioned and the post Cold War situation. Really, why does France have to test in a military sense these weapons of war? It is a bad decision because it is unduly nationalistic. This is not about a sense of international movement. It is a domestic political move on the part of a new president who of course is trying to make a point, a very nationalistic point, in terms of the French domestic electorate at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a bad decision because it has little regard for the wider international ramifications and indeed the deep sensitivities which have been reflected in the speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and subsequent speeches in this place. It is a high-handed decision and therefore, again, a very bad decision. Finally, and most importantly, it is a totally abhorrent decision which we in this House and elsewhere should totally reject. In fact, it flies in the face very strongly of what our permanent representative in the United Nations, Richard Butler, said on 12 May this year&mdash;soon after the indefinite extension was reached in New York. He said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia shared the disappointment of many states that more progress towards nuclear disarmament was not possible during the long years of the Cold War, particularly during the first twenty-five years of the Treaty's life. But this trend has been reversed in recent years. It needs to be promoted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decisions taken on 11 May make this clear. It is of the greatest importance that all parties to the NPT reaffirmed their commitment, for all time, to prevent nuclear proliferation and to work on a program of action for nuclear disarmament with the eventual goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has never accepted that an indefinitely extended NPT would in some way `ligitimize' the status of the nuclear weapon states forever.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not have to point out to the House that France falls into that category. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That would not only be unacceptable, it is simply wrong. It does not reflect what Article VI of the Treaty states.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the Treaty extended indefinitely, the obligation on all states, but particularly the nuclear weapon states, to pursue nuclear disarmament has now become one from which there is no escape.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus it is not only our hope but our expectation that the principles and objectives adopted by this Conference will consolidate progress to date, promote accelerated progress in disarmament negotiations currently under way, and result in additional early steps, in particular a permanent end to nuclear testing by 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>He finished by saying that the NPT review and extension conference saw an endorsement of the value of regional non-proliferation arrangements, such as the South Pacific nuclear-free zone in our own region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could summarise the Prime Minister's speech today on his motion as being more notable for what it did not say rather than what it did say. Earlier I listened to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney), and was not persuaded by what he had to say about some of the defence implications. On 14 June the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the present circumstances the government has decided to freeze co-operation between Australia and France in the defence field at its existing level while any new testing program continues.</PARA>
<PARA>I have read nothing since he made that comment and I have heard nothing today which throws any light on exactly where we are heading with the freezing of the defence tied process. For example, on surveillance, joint exercises and defence industry ties&mdash;today I have heard nobody talk about defence industry ties; perhaps I will come back to that in a moment&mdash;the government's response overall, to be kind, has been very vague indeed. On personnel exchanges, which have been mentioned in the press, a planned exchange of defence scientists has been scrapped as a direct result of this Chirac announcement. We should all commend that decision by the government. On ship visits and aircraft staging, the government announced last Friday that it would not permit the berthing or the landing of ships or aircraft that are involved in the nuclear testing program, although it has not made it clear how it is going to police that arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that the amendment was moved by the opposition. We support a ban on all personnel exchanges, all joint exercises, all French navy ship visits and military aircraft transits except in the case of emergencies. But we are questioning in particular past transit arrangements. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), who is at the table: is it true that France has in the past been able to bypass some of the customs cargo formalities and, in some cases, been able to get away with making no sort of customs declaration? That should ring alarm bells in lots of quarters, not the least of which in that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), even though he is in Paris at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition supports this motion without qualification. However, we will be disappointed at the rejection of the amendment, if that is what is to happen, which would give additional substance to the motion and is not, as the honourable member for Moreton indicated, some cheap political point scoring. We are disappointed that too many questions are left unanswered. We are disappointed at the sit-on-the-fence attitude of notably Great Britain and the United States. We would like to have heard a lot more from President Clinton and others about this nuclear testing by the French government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Australian people want less political rhetoric on this issue and more substantive action with France. The government of France deserves the international condemnation that it is receiving and will continue to receive.

Once again, I say to the parliamentary secretary: please support the opposition's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up until the French decided to use Mururoa and the Polynesian Islands as the testing grounds for their so-called nuclear deterrent program, they had promised colonial independence for these people. For a country which talks about liberty and freedom, denying the right of free determination has brought it shame. It is a country which demands condemnation by this parliament and by this country not just because of its approach to the South Pacific but because of its use of the South Pacific for its nuclear testing program. No doubt other people in this place have said that if nuclear testing was safe the French would quite happily drill holes in France, seal them with concrete and detonate nuclear devices in them. But they do not do it in France; they do it in the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of arguments as to whether or not underground testing of nuclear devices is or is not safe. I am relying on a report published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin of Atomic Scientists</EMPHASIS>. That report has a map of the atoll at Mururoa. It points out that the atoll has at least five lateral fissures and a whole number of longitudinal fissures. There have been recorded blow-outs in the atoll itself where nuclear material from underground testing has in fact leaked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also points out that originally a 28-kilometre strip of the atoll, which is half the reef's ring, was used for underground testing. In that 28-kilometre strip, 46 drills have been sunk between 800 and 1,200 metres deep and bombs have been exploded down those shafts. In other words the bomb blasts have been spaced at about 500-metre intervals on this atoll, which is damn close in anyone's language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about hydrogen bombs. We are not talking about bombs of the size that were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, which were by any stretch of the imagination small bombs. Those bombs, which caused so much damage and loss of life, are now used as trigger devices for hydrogen bombs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French are quite happy to explode at 500-metre intervals hydrogen bombs of quite phenomenal power compared with those used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The French say, `There's no health risk; there's no environmental risk. We're not doing any damage whatsoever.' Yet, strangely enough, we cannot do an independent assessment because the French do not allow independent scientific teams to enter French Polynesia and conduct health tests on the Polynesian population. They just simply say, `No way.' They will not let people do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is known that the most common radiation induced diseases in French Polynesia are leukemia, brain tumours and thyroid cancer. From the early 1980s there has been an enormous increase in French Polynesia in the incidence of these three types of cancers. So the world does know that leukemia, thyroid cancer and brain tumours, commonly associated with radiation illness, are increasing in French Polynesia. But the French will not give us their statistics and they will not discuss what information they have. The French do not even allow people from the French radiation controlling body to enter French Polynesia and conduct their own tests. Only the army and army doctors are allowed into Tahiti to conduct those tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the French say that it is safe and that they are not causing any harm or any damage there, then it seems to me that they would be the first to allow an independent assessment. In 1984 an Australian-New Zealand team was allowed to visit Mururoa. The members of that team did a short study. They were allowed to stay there for only five days. They were not allowed to do deep sea testing in the fissure areas. They were very limited as to what they could do. As Atkinson remarked in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the mission was not permitted to sample sediments from the lagoon nor take any types of samples from the safety trial area, verification was denied.</PARA>
<PARA>But the Atkinson report was highly critical regarding such subjects as radiation ventage, leakage and breakage occurring in the atoll. They were experts. But the report also contained a section on cancer incidence statistics in French Polynesia. They were very critical of the refusal of the French government to allow proper testing and proper survey work to take place in French Polynesia with regard to that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is unarguably clear is that you cannot have over 115 underground tests on an area as small as this atoll and not cause major environmental problems. In the past when the French were conducting atmospheric tests they thumbed their nose at Australia anyway. Who can forget the 1970s when Australia and New Zealand stood up and said, `Get out of the South Pacific'? There were bans on French products in the 1970s. But the French just basically stuck their noses up in the air and told Australians, New Zealanders and people in the Pacific, `It's none of your business.' Today, to their shame, the French still say that French Polynesia is French territory; it is no different from Europe in terms of territorial ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people in my electorate want me to say in this House that it is not on. First of all, we want the French out of the Pacific. We want them to stop being a colonial power in our part of the world. We want the French to understand that, regardless of what they may say, they are causing environmental damage and we do not want nuclear devices exploded in the Pacific. The people in my electorate want me to say to the French that, if it is safe, they should do it in the Mediterranean, outside Paris, in Marseilles or in Provence. Finally, I know the people in my electorate want me to say in this House: vive la France dans la merde. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be up another notch, but I do not want to delay the situation. I do not want to dredge up history, however the history of our relationship with France is particularly meaningful for many Australians. Many Australian men and women are buried in France as a result of the two world wars. Those Australian men and women went to France to defend that country. They went to ensure that France and other nations of the world could live their lives in freedom. Thankfully, that was achieved. Australia is in no way, shape or form indebted to France. The French have not taken one jot of notice of the concerns of the people of the Pacific over their nuclear testing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was speaking to a young woman in my office this morning who has just arrived from the United States. I said to her, `Have you been hearing much about this issue in the United States, Cindy?' She said, `Not a word.' I think the French think they can get away with it because it is only a few small nations in the South Pacific that are bitching and screaming about the situation and on the world stage it does not mean much. It certainly means a lot to the people of Polynesia and the South Pacific, especially the people of Australia and New Zealand which are the two leading nations in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline an interesting juxtaposition. When a lone French yachtswoman came to grief a far way off the southern shores of Australia there was no hesitation in our going to her rescue. It cost some millions of dollars. Various people condemned the government for spending that money to rescue this lone French yachtswoman, but we did it because Australia is a sound world citizen. It was our responsibility to look after someone in distress. I put it to the House that the nations of the Pacific are now in distress as a result of the actions of the French and the French are proving categorically that they are not good world citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House of the circumstances surrounding the sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rainbow Warrior</EMPHASIS> in Auckland, New Zealand. That boat was sunk by the French. It was found that it was French agents that put the boat to the bottom. Whilst doing that they killed a woman. Instead of being charged with murder they were awarded medals of honour by the French government. That sums up the arrogant attitude of the French government in relation to this entire issue. The French are not good world citizens and they have to be snapped back into line. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in support of the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and against the amendment moved by the opposition. Before I do, I want to dwell as much as I can on the bipartisan spirit of this debate. I notice that the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) is at the table. I point out to the House that the honourable member for Indi, as deputy leader, and I had the pleasure of leading a bilateral visit to France and to the European institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the total spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship I can report to the House that we did not fail to signal either to the French government officials or the European parliamentary members that we met that whilst our relations with France had pleasingly improved greatly, particularly given the moratorium on French nuclear testing, any resumption of testing was bound to have serious consequences. Sometimes the people of Australia do not understand that members on both sides operate in a bipartisan way. I commend the honourable member for Indi and all other members of the delegation for their efforts in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also I must say it is pleasing that the opposition does object to the resumption of nuclear testing which France has announced with the change of government. But I then have to draw the line and really get down to the nub of it: if we want to maximise the concern of the Australian people with this parliamentary motion moved by the Prime Minister, then it is important that both sides of parliament are seen to embrace such a proposition without reservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the amendment. It states that we should:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . suspend military cooperation with France; except for surveillance, United Nations and humanitarian activities . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have to say that our military cooperation with France is pretty minimal. Already the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator McMullan, has announced a range of measures. Firstly, there is refusal to refuel for all but humanitarian flights. That has already been announced. And we have gone one step further. We have said that, in terms of the replacement of the RAAF trainer, in considering the tenders offered by various countries, France's activity in the Pacific will be taken into consideration. That also has been announced already. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs has said that, even though there are not very many of them, we have moved to cancel reciprocal visits by ships to each country. We have taken those steps. There is nothing new in what is being proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what I find most amusing, if you like, is the fact that it has been suggested we should recall our ambassador. If we were to do what the opposition is suggesting, recommending or urging the House to do, we should at this very time be placing a call through to the Australian Ambassador&mdash;who is probably with Gareth Evans, chairman of the Pacific forum, meeting with French officials&mdash;and say, `Ambassador, we want to withdraw you out of that meeting for you to come on straight home.' How ridiculous. This is unfortunately, I think, a rather cynical proposition at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to the contribution of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). I need to remind the House and the Australian people that this is the former Leader of the Opposition who self-destructed, shredded himself into pieces&mdash;not a victim of a government onslaught, but that he self-destructed. What was his reaction? His reaction, of course, was that we should send a frigate over there. I am sure that, if those opposite had the aircraft carrier they have always wanted, they would have wanted to send the aircraft carrier. What good would that do? Of course, the opposition and its leader have had to walk away from that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the topic of France, I would try to put on the record how deeply Australian people cannot understand the need for France in the 1990s to have a nuclear deterrent. In their defence policy position, similar to our Australian white paper, who is the enemy? Is it the traditional enemy, Germany, against whom Australians have fought in France during two world wars, leaving French soil soaked with Australian blood? Is this the traditional enemy? Is this the one against whom they need the force de frappe? Or is it Albion; is it Mr Major and his legions over in England? Are these the people against whom France needs to have this nuclear deterrent? Or are the French worried that the hordes will descend through Luxembourg into France?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This makes no sense at all, particularly to the honourable member for Indi and I who were in France and Europe 12 months ago. Clearly, Germany and France occupy a leadership position in the European Union. That France should be detonating nuclear bombs and weapons in our backyard goes smack against the position that Germany and France hold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you get mixed signals about what the French people believe. If they believe and support a nuclear deterrent in this day and age, I have to say it is a real pity that that support does not extend to testing in France, testing on the French-German border, or digging into the channel between France and England and testing there. If France must test, it should not do so in our backyard. But, of course, it is doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought the honourable member for Mayo made some very disparaging remarks about the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). He disparaged the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is touted by some as the future Secretary-General. I am very proud to say that we have already had an Australian as the President of the United Nations. A former member for Barton was the President of the United Nations. The idea that an Australian could hold the position and could be seen to be effective in all the challenges for the United Nations of the 1990s is something we should be proud of and not condemn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mayo was also critical that Senator Evans highlighted in this morass of a decision that at least France was embracing the fact that it would join the comprehensive test ban treaty. I must say that as much as I abhor this decision to resume nuclear testing in our backyard, I do welcome the position of France in saying that it will embrace the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. What possible threat does it see in Europe that requires this force de frappe, this nuclear deterrent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other suggestion contained in the opposition's amendment to the motion is that the United States should share its data. Clearly, approaches must have been made in that regard and the United States declined to do so. I would have welcomed a positive decision by the United States to avoid this testing, because the United States itself&mdash;the last remaining superpower on the globe&mdash;is declining to test. If it had shared its data with the French, so much the better. But when we move a motion that is so important to the Australian people, we ought to be confident that what we are advocating and proposing is practical. I suggest that this amendment is not practical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I started my speech by saying that I support the Prime Minister's motion. I regret that the strength of the Prime Minister's motion&mdash;and the moving of such motions is not a very normal procedure for the House&mdash;has been somewhat diminished by the fact that an amendment has been moved by the opposition. </PARA>

I hope ASEAN countries will join us in the South Pacific and voice very strongly and condemn strongly the fact that France is not a good corporate world citizen, is acting unilaterally and unrealistically and is endangering our environment, not her own. I commend the motion moved by the Prime Minister. I wish it could be passed without qualification, with the unanimous support of all members of parliament, without being sullied by an amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is sad that the government has not approached this subject&mdash;which all of us see as probably more fundamental than almost any other in the environmental sense&mdash;in a proper way. The future of the children in the South Pacific is predicated on a comprehensive test ban treaty being put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) introduced was an attempt to ensure that all of the ground that had been lost by the Labor Party when it went soft on the French announcement about nuclear testing would somehow be offset in the minds of the electorate. The trouble with the Prime Minister is that he was not content to just make a statement: not only did he make a statement but he then sought to speak on the opposition's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is, of course, a very good politician, but politics has several levels. The most significant part of politics in this case should be to try to ensure that a message of strength, integrity and purpose is sent to the French government, following the announcement by President Chirac that a series of nuclear tests will be conducted in the South Pacific. But what has happened since the announcement was made by President Chirac? Firstly, nothing was done when he made the announcement during the campaign. Secondly, when it was announced as a result of his being elected, the idea was allowed to continue, as though in some way it was an afterthought and something which he had not committed himself to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My worry about this whole debate is that it exists on three levels. The first is even beyond the comprehensive test ban treaty. Like the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), I have had the opportunity to look at some stations in Belgium which monitor the level of radiation that comes from nuclear explosions around the world. The graphs that came out of those monitoring stations show that, at the time of the Chernobyl explosion, there was an appalling increase in the fallout in the Northern Hemisphere. We know that the result was that it affected people not only around the Ukraine but also in Finland and in the whole of western Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and most significant part of this debate should be to recognise that any type of a nuclear fallout is something which can have pernicious effects which are harmful to society and dangerous to mankind. It is absolutely important that we start at that level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second level is one which has to address the problems that the announcement by President Chirac represents. In that too, I think most people in this place would be fundamentally in agreement. The difficulty is that the Prime Minister, in the manner and form of his response, was saddled by the initial press conference given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) in Tokyo. It is of no use the Prime Minister, the Labor Party and everybody else saying that the foreign minister was misunderstood. It would have been far better if the Prime Minister had for once tried to adopt a position above politics. But, unfortunately, he tends to see everything in the light of the next election, rather than in the light of what should be done internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is absolutely appalling that the Prime Minister's behaviour today has reduced the effectiveness of the South Pacific Forum delegation to France. It is of no use the member for Chifley and the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, suggesting in some way that, because we have moved an amendment, we are prejudicing Australia's case. My friends, what we have done is to show that your Prime Minister is extraordinarily vulnerable. If he had any statesmanlike instincts, if he had the capacity to be a Prime Minister which all Australians could be proud of and if he had the capacity to influence the French in a mission which we all endorse, he would have shut up and registered that there were points in the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) which he and his colleagues would have done well to endorse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third level relates to the last paragraph of the opposition's amendment which concerns the sharing of data with the United States. I cannot understand why a computer test cannot be run which would give exactly the same appraisal of nuclear weapons as the French are apparently seeking to obtain from the eight tests proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that, even if there has been a refusal, as the honourable member for Chifley suggests, and the United States has said that it is not prepared to share data, there is every reason for the world to say to the United States&mdash;which, I was horrified to learn this morning, may also be considering a number of underground explosions&mdash;that there are ways in which computers can assess the consequences of nuclear weapons, nuclear fallouts and whatever other chemical formulae that may be needed to be tested. Why it cannot be done on a computer, I do not know. If we put pressure on the United States to agree to computer testing of the French weapons, perhaps the tests could be avoided all together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real thing that worries me is that the Labor Party has played this whole issue far too much for domestic consumption and far too little for persuading the French. I mentioned the response by the Prime Minister to the amendment. I go back to the initial performance by the foreign minister in his press conference in Tokyo. I will quote from an article by Geoffrey Barker in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of Monday, 19 June. There are three comments that I think are worth remembering. First he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suddenly he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Minister Evans&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is revealing glimpses of the gung-ho Attorney-General who earned the nickname "Biggles" 12 years ago . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Remember? That is the trouble. He is impetuous. He does things because he does not really think. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when he sent RAAF fighters to spy on Tasmania's Franklin dam site, explaining afterwards that it seemed like a good idea at the time.</PARA>
<PARA>The second thing is that we need to understand that the South Pacific Forum is only one of the bodies in this region that we ought to be trying to persuade to support our case. If Senator Gareth Evans has had a rethink, and if the Prime Minister's views of today which he put when speaking to his motion are to be sustained, why does he not raise in APEC the whole question of nuclear testing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite incredible. Here is this new body, a new association of countries of the Pacific rim, a group that is set up to consider realistically matters of importance to our region. It is not just a trade association. To date it has only met with heads of state. The Prime Minister is going out there saying what a great rapport he has with all the heads of state in our region. Why does he not go to APEC? He could start with Japan, which we know is opposed to nuclear testing. He could go around all those countries in the western Pacific rim that are opposed to the French tests. He could then go to the United States and say that there is a significant body of opinion within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation which says that this nuclear testing should not proceed. From there, you have got a body of opinion that even France would feel apprehensive in rejecting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no truck with the violence that appeared in Perth the other day. I think that, if anything, weakened the Australian case. I think it is unfortunate when anything other than symbolic processes are used. As soon as you use violence against violence, you tend to destroy the whole position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly believe that APEC is a forum which at this stage is untested and untried. Had I had a say in an amendment to this motion, I would have added to it a suggestion that there be a resolution raised with all those who are heads of state within APEC and I would suggest that they consider the question of whether or not action should be taken jointly to attempt to stop the French testing at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept the position that testing should take place only on mainland France. As far as I am concerned, it should not take place at all. That last item in the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), which suggests that the United States should be contacted and a method found by which computer appraisal might be enable you to do all that you otherwise could, is the course that should be followed. I support the amendment and am very disappointed that the Labor Party apparently at this stage is not inclined to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I need to check with the Foreign Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to see whether there was any advance notice other than the public statement by President Chirac.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the Leader of the Opposition today, in standing to support the motion that I proposed to the House, sought to politicise it and diminish the foreign minister's standing in the middle of this negotiation. That sort of absence of any loyalty to the common approach does not reflect well on him. That is why I think the Leader of the Opposition need not fear that anything that the foreign minister says will be consistent and cogent as has always been the case during his most distinguished period chairing the foreign ministry.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure all members are aware that as from 1 July responsibility for Commonwealth funding and program delivery in the area of Aboriginal health will come to my department. I am pleased to inform members of the House and the member who asked the question that that transfer is progressing very well. There have already been very significant achievements secured, particularly in relation to a national effort. I think all the ministers responsible clearly recognise that Aboriginal health is a complex issue and governments, if they are to achieve anything here, have to work together and work effectively. The present poor health status of Aboriginal people indicates to all observers that the current system is not working, so a concerted effort by all governments is required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased that last week health ministers from around the country agreed to enter into bilateral agreements to ensure a national coordinated approach. I do indicate however that some four years ago the same commitment was made and I will certainly be looking for early results. The agreements will be based on agreed national principles and criteria and will reflect the priorities that occur in each state and territory, because clearly there are great differences between the states and territories. I have indicated, and they have agreed, that they will be completed no later than February. So we will have a genuinely national effort. Those agreements will also ensure that the buck passing stops. It will not be good enough to blame another government, because we will have agreements about funding and service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased that the conference reaffirmed the importance of community control and participation. There has been some resistance on that score from some state and territory governments, but all the ministers finally agreed that that was critical. They also agreed that there are no quick fix solutions in this area and that we need to build a much more responsive health care system. In order to do that we obviously have to ensure that Aboriginal people are involved at every level. For instance, they will be consulted about and involved in the council for aboriginal health, which will determine policy. They will also be consulted about and involved in the indigenous health work force corporation, which will be established this year, and they will also help devise a mental health and hearing service strategy, for which funds are provided in this budget. There will also be consultative committees established in each state and territory, reporting back by October.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past the state and territory governments have not worked with the Commonwealth as well as they might. That is not necessarily anyone's fault, and I am not attempting to blame any one organisation, but I think that what emerged last week in Alice Springs was a very clear commitment from all parties. I am delighted that we will now have a very genuine and national coordinated effort in this very important area of health care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Why did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade wait until last week to even begin work on an options paper on Australia's response to possible resumption of French nuclear testing? Why did this crucial work not commence the day after President Chirac was elected on 7 May? Why has the department still failed to complete its policy submission on the implications of the new French presidency? Why did the Minister for Trade not even bother to raise the question of French nuclear testing when he met with the European Commission Vice-President, Sir Leon Brittan, on 15 May, when it was already clear that the new French President was intent on reinstituting nuclear tests? Is this not clear evidence that the Minister for Foreign Affairs showed no interest whatsoever in stopping the tests until well after they were publicly announced?</PARA></TALK.START>

When the foreign minister consistently argues the position where the French, through President Chirac, have said that they will sign the comprehensive test ban treaty and he points to the fact that, objectionable though this may be, it was limited, according to the French, to eight tests and was not an ongoing program and was not about the development of a new weapon but the stability of the existing stockpile, he is to be roundly condemned by the member for Mayo.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for McEwen for drawing to my attention an article in a local paper in his electorate by his coalition opponent based on a highly misleading statement by the Australian Taxpayers Association. The fact is that the introduction of the parenting allowance from 1 July will be a major boost to Australian families. The bottom line is that spending on families programs as a result of these changes will be $400 million a year higher than it would have been in the absence of these programs. It is obvious that families are the beneficiaries of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This article had a table which was calculated, I would say, to mislead. It left out of account crucial facets about the new structure. The article makes no reference to the well over 100,000 families who will benefit from the much higher rate of parenting allowance targeted to low income households. That will provide an average benefit of around $117 a fortnight, we calculated, to a large number of low-income families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also fails to take into account the potential gainers from the re-configuration of the income test that will accompany the transition from home child-care allowance to parenting allowance. Under the current income test for home child-care allowance, which is the same as the old income test relating to the with child dependent spouse rebate, the carer starts to lose entitlement after earning just $10.80 a fortnight. Under the new income test you will have a free area of $60 a fortnight&mdash;almost six times as much under the new arrangements which will come into effect from 1 July. There are well over 100,000&mdash;the estimate is around 140,000&mdash;who will gain financially as a consequence of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have substantially enhanced assistance to low-income families and put in a far more satisfactory income test, with a much higher threshold&mdash;almost six times as high&mdash;and with a higher taper rate that has resulted from the re-configuration of that test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overwhelmingly, people stand to gain. The bottom line is that there is $400 million a year more going to Australian families as a result of these changes than would have been the case previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The table in this article that appeared in the honourable member's electorate is calculated to mislead. At the end of the day, in the event that some people end up worse off as a consequence of those changes compared to HCCA they can fall back on the old with child rate of dependent spouse rebate at the end of the financial year. There are no losers and a very substantial number of winners, and some very large winners indeed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports that some students at the Australian National University here in Canberra discovered on the Internet a guide which apparently contained tips on how to get away with a rape. Naturally, material of this sort is completely objectionable. It is offensive to all reasonable people. Unfortunately, it does not appear to be a completely isolated incident. There does appear to have been other objectionable material circulating through computer bulletin boards and via the Internet, such as how to engage in terrorist activity or how to make bombs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's starting point is to have a censorship regime which is effectively technology neutral; that is, if material such as the honourable member described were produced by way of a film, a video or in book form it would be subject to classification, and most likely in that case would be banned outright. Those same sorts of principles should apply to material which finds its way into circulation via the Internet. I suppose we do have to get the thing into proportion. There is a vast array of information available on the Internet and 99.9 per cent of that material is perfectly reasonable legitimate material which can go to proper ends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, even though the amount of material involved may be very small, we do need to be concerned about it. That is why the Minister for Communications and the Arts and I, together with state ministers involved with censorship issues, have been working on the introduction of a new regime to cover the production of material on the Internet. This regime will have three tiers to it. The first will be the development of a code of practice to be developed by the industry itself. This is something which I think the industry broadly supports, although it is fair to say, given this is such new technology, that there are not clearly operating peak associations as such in terms of provider and user groups. However, we are working with what groups do exist to develop that code of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second tier will involve a complaints mechanism similar to that which is currently operated by Telecom on 0055 numbers. Given that we have received a range of complaints, including the one the honourable member refers to, there is clearly scope for such a mechanism to be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third tier will involve the enactment of new offences in order to cover the production of this material. That will deal with material which would otherwise be banned if it was produced by way of film, video or literature or material that would receive a rating which would not allow it to be available to minors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures are of concern to the government. They will be discussed again by the Commonwealth and the states at the next Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.

It is quite clear that we need not only to respond to the ageing of our population but particularly to look carefully at the ageing of the postwar migrant intake.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the rest of the community, older people from ethnic communities want to stay in their homes for as long as possible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our strategy, however, involves full partnership with private and charitable sectors.

In Western Australia, Victoria and the ACT we are now trialling placement of dedicated ethnic liaison officers in some of our larger facilities and community care programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that in Victoria, following consultations with DEET, aged care providers and ethnic organisations, we are developing a pilot traineeship program for the ethnic unemployed, particularly older women, for places in hostels and community care services.

Nevertheless, the government considered the whole of the diesel rebate scheme in the budget process and made no fundamental changes to it.

In this way, we can keep the scheme targeted to do the things we wish it to do&mdash;to give that relief to people in primary industry and in mining&mdash;but at the same time keep it focused and targeted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Justice. The minister would be aware of the recent World Trade Organisation agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights. Can the minister advise the House what implications there are for the enforcement of such rights under Australian copyright law?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1726" SPEAKER="Kerr The Hon D.J.C." NAMEID="RH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DENISON" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fortunately, and I think because of the foresight that this parliament has had in terms of the framing of our copyright legislation, the answer is only a minimal implication. This is because, in the past, the international community has left it to copyright owners to enforce their own rights. Whilst they have been the owners of a set of property rights, there has not been a legal obligation internationally to deal with the dispossession of those rights as theft or `copyright piracy', which is the phrase used in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade related agreement now deems it necessary for governments to provide criminal sanctions as well as civil sanctions to protect copyright owners. Australia already has in place a regime which permits criminal actions to be taken to stop the theft of intellectual property and to combat piracy. In that respect, only minimal change to our laws is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where our law does require change is in the area of Customs. Copyright owners will now be able to alert Customs of a threatened transit of a pirated product. Customs will seize the product, and there will be a process to determine whether that claim is justified or otherwise. If the claim is not made out, the product will be released to the importers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means the burden of enforcement is shared between the private and public sectors. That is pretty important because, not withstanding any changes in this international environment, I do not think anyone who is a copyright owner or associated with law enforcement expects that there could be a wholesale shift of the cost of copyright protection from the private sector to the public sector. It obviously needs to be worked out together. In the past, various film and video associations have funded a private group working with the Australian Federal Police to ensure that their criminal rights are also enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a legitimate concern amongst some in the copyright community that insufficient seriousness is paid to the consequences of the piracy of copyright material. Sometimes penalties that have been awarded by courts have been thought to be too low, and representations have been made to the government about this. I have also had representations from the Business Software Association. It has sought to ensure that there is effective cooperation between the Federal Police and itself to protect software users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, I think this government has a lot to be proud of in terms of the way in which it has made a wholesome, effective copyright environment. After having had recent discussions with the BSA, I can say this: only three countries have lower levels of piracy than Australia&mdash;the United States, South Africa and, I think, Austria. This means that we do a heck of a lot better than most European countries. We certainly do better than Britain and France, and we certainly do better than any of our neighbours in this region. It is a reputation that we as a government are keen to maintain.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I would like to talk about Medicare and, in particular, the injustice in the treatment of people in the country compared with that of those in the city. There is a major imbalance. Rebates to people in the country are something like 30 per cent less than those to people in the city.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer honourable members to the answer to a question I put on notice to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), question No. 2107, which gives some very detailed answers as to the level of Medicare rebates to all electorates over the last three financial years. I asked what the Medicare benefits were on a per capita basis for each of the financial years. We see from the answer that, from the time Medicare was introduced, there has been a growing imbalance, yet the government has repeatedly been using words like `fair' and `fairest' to describe Medicare. We see this first when the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, wrote to all Australians in 1983. In part of that letter he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare is not only a cheaper and simpler system but it is also fairer.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1987 we had the member for Canning, now the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have said, it is the fairest system we have.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1989, former Minister for Health Dr Blewett said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that that is the fairest system of all . . .</PARA>
<PARA>These are the sorts of superlatives the government has been using. Yet when we start to look at the facts, we see that these statements unravel somewhat. These figures actually show that there are massive deficiencies in the Medicare provision for rural health. They show that, in the country, rebates are around $239 per head per year, yet in the city they are nearly $100 more at $324 per person per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This shows very clearly that Labor has neglected rural Australia for 12 years. It is trying to do its best to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. After all, rural and remote Australia produces over 70 per cent of Australia's exports and contains 28 per cent of the population. Yet rural and remote Australia is served by only 20 per cent of Australia's general practitioners and just 10 per cent of the specialists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While not wishing to overplay the point, it is very interesting to note the following fact: if you look at the average amount of rebate and the electorates that place above that average, you find that there are more Labor held electorates than coalition held electorates. Significantly, you find that the majority of electorates that fall below that average are coalition electorates, not Labor electorates. I find that highly curious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some examples. In the 1993-94 year, for example, the rebate to the electorate of Blaxland was $399; Watson, $453; Sydney, $429.89; Melbourne Ports, $413; and Kingsford Smith, $392. If we look at some of the country electorates, we find, for example, that in my electorate of Wannon the average rebate was just $215.86; Grey, $213.99; Braddon, $219; Forrest, $208; Kennedy, $195; and O'Connor, $198. There is clearly a very big difference. In fact, the difference is that in some cases country electorates are getting just half. Yet people in the country still pay the same Medicare levy. Obviously they are getting less value for their dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government often likes to emphasise in reports that there are similar bed numbers in the country and the city, but this hides many of the facts. City beds are of a far higher intensity and they offer far more specialised services. As we all know, country areas suffer a lack of general practitioners, specialists and equipment. I would like to think that it was otherwise, but the idea that country health is better is, regrettably, a myth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to look at the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rural health and welfare in Australia</EMPHASIS> in 1990 to see that the country experiences higher accidental death and injuries, allergic reactions, skin disorders and suicides than do people in the cities. Likewise, if we look at the rates for avoidable death, we find that they are 47 per cent higher for men in the country than in the city, and 30 per cent higher for women. The Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health estimates that there is a need for 300 to 500 GPs to improve the rural health situation. It has been saying this for some time. There is also a need for specialists, as I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What people in the country find so galling is the minister's arrogant attitude toward the elderly in the country. Clearly there is a growing number of elderly people in the country. Often they are far from their family or from other people and there is a greater need for hostel care, probably more so than in the city in many cases. Yet, as I found in a case in my own electorate, the minister refused to meet a delegation from Lismore where the hospital was under very serious threat, notwithstanding that half the funding of that hospital came from the Commonwealth for the nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue becomes more serious when we look at what has happened because of the slump in farming. It has clearly had a major effect, not just on farmers and the health of farming families but on those involved in non-farm businesses in the country. There are two studies around that highlight this. The first one is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rural businesses and the recession: its effects in six NSW towns</EMPHASIS>, which was done last year by the University of New South Wales. The second one is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better health: rural health project 1991-93</EMPHASIS>, which was put out by the Uniting Church in Melbourne in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These studies show that due to the slump in farming incomes there has been an increase in domestic violence; an increase in accidents on roads and on farms; an increase in the consumption of anti-depressants and tranquillisers; an increase in mental, physical and social disorders and suicides; and a high level of drug and alcohol consumption. What response have we seen from the government? We have seen what has been occurring in so many other areas of this government: it has become the government of perpetual announcements. It has become the master of the major announcements, the glossy brochure, the earnest report, and then the complete let-down&mdash;and so it goes round again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what has happened in recent years. The national rural health strategy was to start in 1991. It was repackaged in 1994 just to see whether it had some meaning. In 1990, the rural health support education and training program was introduced. The rural incentives program, RIP&mdash;one wonders what that was really meant to refer to&mdash;was introduced in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had the multi-purpose centres and multi-purpose service programs introduced in 1989. Then, despite all these inquiries and little extra efforts, guess what happened in 1994? The government started the Australian Rural Health Research Institute. I guess its job was to study what had happened to the previous four, because clearly they had not had effect. They are very impressive sounding names, but we have had from government perpetual announcements. Instead of dealing with the major problem of providing better health services in the country, we find the government is more interested in trying to make perpetual announcements. It has very little to show after all these years. What it shows is that, despite these programs, despite these inquiries, despite all these announcements, the facts speak louder than the words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that for country people Medicare is not the fairest system. People in the country, on average, are getting $100 per year per head less than their city counterparts. Clearly this shows in a very stark way just how much the government is failing to provide decent health services to people in the country. I think what we really ought to be saying to the government is, `Look, if you can't do this, here is an option. If you can't provide better services to the country, you really should give serious consideration to giving $100 rebate to people living in the country so they do not get ripped off by this system.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is clearly a massive imbalance and it is about time the government had the decency to admit it. Country people know it. Country doctors know it. It is about time that this government knew it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I grieve for the state of Australia's federal system&mdash;in particular, for the poor level of cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states in many areas and the consequential impact on social policies and the goals of equity and social justice. It is not the first time I have spoken on some of these issues in this place, but they remain one of our greatest problems in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is six years away from the centenary of Federation, which occurred in 1901. The constitution is now 94 years old. We have had a lot of debate about the constitution in recent years, particularly with the advent of the republic debate. Of course, we had the historic statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) two weeks ago about the proposed republic and there has been a lot of debate from the usual sources about how we should never change the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any debate involving the Australian constitution, especially in this place, is bound to evoke strong feelings and passions. It seems that, whenever anyone suggests a change or a reform to our society which may require amendment to the constitution, members of the conservative opposition parties, the Liberal and National parties, those forces of reaction opposite&mdash;I cannot see any here at the moment&mdash;typically find a way of opposing it, no matter how sensible or how necessary it might be. For these forces of reaction, their argument seems to be that the constitution should never be changed, simply because it supposedly reflects the intent of the `founding fathers'&mdash;and I guess the people who wrote the constitution were all men in those days&mdash;of the 1890s. They say that therefore the constitution is sacrosanct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to escape these people that what may have seemed appropriate to conservative colonial lawyers and politicians in the 1890s may no longer be relevant to the best interests of Australia in the 1990s. After all, the task in the 1890s was to draft a constitution to bring together six sovereign colonial states into one nation, at a time when the horse and buggy was the normal mode of transport. The situation is, of course, very different now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this self-serving conservatism of those parties representing the ruling classes which has made constitutional reform a difficult path in Australia. Constitutional change requires a referendum to be carried by a majority of voters in four out of the six states as well as a majority of voters overall, which in itself makes reform difficult, especially when it concerns so-called states rights and the powers of state governments. Consequently, only eight out of 42 referenda put to the Australian people since 1901 have been passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past century, as advancement in communications, technology and social conditions continue to make state boundaries and divisions less relevant, federal governments, especially reforming federal Labor governments, have had to rely on other means to bring about progress, especially in social policy. These include use of the Commonwealth's financial powers under section 96 of the constitution, which involves specific purpose payments, or SPPs, to states for specific government programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a federal system of government, and has had since 1901. Federalism is a system of government in which authority is distributed between central and regional governments. Although there is no pre-eminent definition of federalism, it is generally agreed that its main features involve power sharing between the levels or tiers of government, with each enjoying some degree of autonomy from the other. Federalism places limits on the powers of these levels of government by means of a written constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian constitution divides the areas of law making between the two tiers of government&mdash;federal and state. As in the United States, the powers of the Commonwealth of Australia are enumerated, that is, they are written into the constitution; while those of the states are residual, that is, they have powers over any function not mentioned in the constitution. Some of the powers of the Commonwealth are exclusive, meaning the Commonwealth has sole jurisdiction, while others are concurrent or shared with the states. For example, taxation is a concurrent power, as each level of government may raise taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 51 of the constitution sets out most of the areas in which the Commonwealth can legislate. It includes matters central to a national government such as defence, postal services and currency and coinage. Other powers of the Commonwealth are listed in section 52, where the Commonwealth has exclusive powers over the seat of government, the Public Service and `other matters declared by the Constitution to be within the exclusive power of the Commonwealth'. Section 109 gives the Commonwealth the right to prevail when laws are inconsistent in areas where both levels of government can legislate; while section 96 permits the Commonwealth to allocate tied financial grants to the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The powers of the states are set out in section 107 of the constitution, which declares that every power that is not vested exclusively with the Commonwealth remains in the domain of state governments. The original division of responsibilities left the states with most of their day-to-day functions, including law and order, education, health, housing, transport and land use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vast changes have occurred in Australian society since the drafting of the Australian constitution nearly 95 years ago. This has facilitated a gap between the written constitution and modern political and social realities. This seems most stark in the area of social policy, the area I want to particularly address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of Federation, the attitudes towards social policy were equivocal. The constitution provided for Commonwealth powers in areas such as defence and foreign affairs. However, it did not fully set out, or hardly set out at all, the responsibility for social policy because it was assumed in those days that private charities or the states would provide resources in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the 20th century there has been increasing pressure for the development of cohesive national social policies. To meet these demands, the Commonwealth and state governments have taken various informal and constitutional actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal structure is a perennial source of tension and debate in Australian politics. Over the years various reviews have been considered, both formal and informal. It is in the area of social policy where most of the tensions arise between the Commonwealth and the states; in areas like defence, taxation and social security there are very clear-cut Commonwealth powers; the states obviously have responsibility for the areas I mentioned, such as land use, the police force, education and transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in areas of social policy that Labor governments, in particular since 1972, have found the need to become more involved. There are plenty of glaring examples of this&mdash;Aboriginal health, mental health, child care and a number of others such as aged care. The reason the Commonwealth has had to get involved in most of these areas is that over the decades state governments have basically failed to provide adequate resources for social justice and adequate social policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth, certainly since Labor was elected in 1972, has seen the need to get more involved. Because of the limitations provided by the constitution, the way the Commonwealth has had to do it is largely through financial arrangements such as specific purpose grants. I am currently involved in a Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquiry into specific purpose payments to the states. I think all the state governments have put forward written submissions, although only some of them have agreed to appear before our committee. It is very interesting, although hardly surprising, to note that when they have appeared they have put forward the view that the Commonwealth should keep out of telling the states what to do with what they consider to be their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, that money is Commonwealth money. The Commonwealth raises the taxes, yet the states believe we should hand over the money, particularly in the area of social policy, and leave it to the states to decide how to spend it. I think any reasonable government committed to social justice at the national level would reject that view. I certainly reject that view. I will be very interested to see how this inquiry unfolds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the area of social policy that I believe we need fundamental change in Australian society. While it might not be possible nor even necessary to abolish state governments&mdash;a lot of us on this side would probably like to see that happen one day&mdash;in the short term to achieve the outcomes that we want, I think we need to look at the roles of the Commonwealth and the states. Included there are some obvious ones. The Commonwealth has a clear role in foreign affairs, defence and taxation. The states have a clear role in the areas I mentioned earlier: police, land use and urban transport. A lot of areas which at the moment are subject to Commonwealth-state agreements I think would be better placed in the Commonwealth domain. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I grieve for the elderly in the electorate of Cowper, who are totally neglected by this Labor government. That is an outstanding claim to make, but the figures prove it. The government is pork-barrelling in the Labor held seats of Richmond and Page in looking to the next election. I think it is absolutely outrageous that by the year 2000 the aged care situation in Cowper will be the worst in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor neglect is evidenced by last year's round of nursing home bed allocations. Cowper received four extra nursing home beds, which went to the Legacy nursing home. It really needed six to be viable, but what did Labor do? It gave that nursing home only four. Richmond, a Labor held seat, got an extra 40 nursing home beds. Its situation is no worse than Cowper. We have a desperate need. Organisations like Marion Grove are doing a wonderful job with aged care hostels. They desperately want to provide nursing home beds. I am giving them the total support that I can, but unless Labor is going to be fair, equitable and just that is just not going to happen. Others in other centres also need that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to see what happened with the community aged care packages&mdash;again, great injustice. Page got 50 places; Richmond got 60 places; Cowper got none. Worse still, the Aged Care Advisory Committee has already recommended that the mid-north coast, which is basically Cowper, should not be targeted for any more nursing home places in this coming financial year. I think this is absolutely outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that by 1997, which is not that far away, in the electorate of Cowper&mdash;which takes in the Macleay Valley, the Nambucca Valley, the Bellinger Valley and Coffs Harbour&mdash;there will be a shortfall of 151 hostel places, a shortfall of 90 nursing home beds and a shortfall of 121 CACPs. This is on the government's own ratio. By the year 2001, the shortfall on nursing home beds will be 167; on hostel places, 246; and on CACPs, 141. That is a supreme illustration of just how this government has neglected and is neglecting seats not held by itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the budget we find that self-funded retirees are being kicked in the pants again. The l-a-w law tax cuts are not going to go through to them. Self-funded retirees have worked hard and saved. At the last election the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised tax cuts for seniors. The National Party believes and I believe it would be just and equitable for the taxation threshold for self-funded independent retirees to be raised from $5,400 to $10,720&mdash;the same as it is for pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government promised it would reduce tax on the incomes of seniors over $20,700, but now there is no benefit whatsoever to senior Australians looking after themselves. This promise is no good to those with superannuation who are going to retire before it comes into effect. Those self-funded retirees will have to pay more tax because of the tax on cars and petrol. Sales tax is going up, and if they need to maintain their house they will have to face the 12 per cent sales tax on building materials the government is trying to put through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All over Australia the building industry is in trouble. There has been a 30 per cent downturn in new housing approvals which has affected national housing growth. When the 12 per cent sales tax hits, it will make the industry worse off. That 12 per cent sales tax on building materials will affect everyone. It will affect not only builders but also carpenters, brickies, electricians, plumbers, whitegoods manufacturers, retailers, solicitors, carpet manufacturers and those who sell curtains and light fittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also disappointed that the government is attacking subcontractors. About 18 months ago, I fought on behalf of carpet layers against the Taxation Office in Newcastle, which was trying, in a pilot study, to categorise them as PAYE taxpayers. These people, whether they are carpet layers, brick layers or carpenters, are independent, self-supporting businessmen. This new proposal will take them out of that situation and put them into the PAYE tax system. I believe the hidden agenda is a ploy to recruit them for the unions. The Australian housing industry is entirely based on subcontractors. In fact, we have the most efficient housing industry in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to make the point that the Pacific Highway has been dumped by Labor. There is still 430 kilometres with only two lanes and there is only 60 kilometres of dual highway between Hexham and the Queensland border. The government has also dumped the black spots program. I am pleased to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the people of Australia that it is National Party policy to have that black spots program reinstated as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am most concerned about and grieve for the families of timber workers. The workers in the forests, the contractors and the sawmillers are all under threat and under attack. They have no certainty, they are worried about their mortgages, and their wives are very concerned. In a moment I will refer to an excellent report produced under the sponsorship of the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been shown that these forest workers have to guard their equipment from sabotage. The forest industries of Australia must have resource security. They have to be able to plan for the future. When we talk about plantations we have to make the point that there must be harvesting rights. There is no point encouraging people to invest enormous amounts of money in plantation timber if at the end of the day the fanatic greenies will put them in the situation where they cannot cut down a single tree. We have to realise that we will never satisfy the extreme environmental greenies, because they are never satisfied with what we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made mention of the report sponsored by the member for Eden-Monaro. I must compliment him on the report on the controversy in the hardwood industry in south-eastern New South Wales carried out by Gerry Cirulli. This report applies to the timber workers, the forest families, the kids and the workers in the honourable member's area. It also applies to the constituents of my electorate of Cowper. People in Dorrigo are under threat and people in the Upper Macleay who are dependent on timber are also under threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report found that there was a massive proportion of worry and stress over uncertainty in the women and children of timber workers. In an interview conducted for the report, a logger said, `How can I plan my future when I don't know if I will have a job tomorrow or not?' That was the sort of complaint that was repeated time and time again. That is the sort of uncertainty affecting the timber industry throughout New South Wales. Just on 60 per cent of respondents reported suffering from insomnia, ranging from severe to mild, caused by worry and stress. There is no stress leave for timber workers. Mind you they lose their fingers, their knuckles, their hands and sometimes their legs. It is a very dangerous business, and they are very hardworking people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The respondents are being made to feel socially ostracised. Because they work in the timber industry, and because of the campaign against it, they are made to feel guilty. That brings on strong feelings of frustration, anger and, indeed, bewilderment. No Australian citizen, no Australian family or no Australian mother or kid, should be subjected to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are finding that mothers have to spend nights in the forest to guard the family's costly logging equipment to stop the greenies from sabotaging it. They spend the night in the forest so their husband can sleep so he can work the next day. This is Australia and this is going on. It is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Children are complaining of being reared in towns developing a siege mentality. In some schools the subject of logging has been banned from school discussions. Some parents have complained of children being indoctrinated in some schools through the teaching of greenie songs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to make sure that we do have a sustainable forest industry in Australia, that people who are working in the forestry industry do have a future and that those who are prepared to invest in plantations have security and the harvesting rights for when the trees have grown. For the whole of the timber industry, we must have resource security. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All honourable members want to see a secure future for the timber industry but I have to say that I can see no future for the timber industry if the emphasis is merely on the cutting down of sawlogs or on woodchipping. The real future for the timber industry, I believe, rests in value adding. Parties on both sides of this House have a lot to answer for in that there is not the value adding in this industry that there should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember that when the timber industry appeared before the caucus working group it was saying that no research had been done into Australian timbers to identify those that were suitable for replacing rainforest timbers in housing construction or, alternatively, studies had not been undertaken to determine what was the minimum safe level of timber that could be used in housing construction to make that a viable alternative and one that was competitive with the steel structure that is being used more and more. So we have a lot to do but value adding is the way ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the state government for the initiatives it has taken. In terms of the effect on families, I sympathise with the contribution of the member for Cowper.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this grievance debate, I want to raise a few points. I would like to draw to the attention of the House that, in the week before the election when I was an endorsed candidate for the seat of Chifley, I discovered to my horror that there was radioactive waste at the ADI site at St Marys. I have raised this issue in the caucus. I have put questions on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. I have variously and vigorously pursued this issue for some time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Virtue, persistency and stubbornness are rewarded, as the minister says so kindly. People can say, as was said to me during that period, that this is safe and these quantities are very small. In fact, I had the opportunity to walk into the bunker and observe the waste being stored at the ADI at St Marys. But the point I would make, and it is particularly relevant in this era of the resumption of nuclear testing by France, is that no amount of radioactive waste, no matter how safely stored, should be stored in the vicinity of about half a million people&mdash;the number is even higher, depending on where you want to draw the radius&mdash;living in the Blacktown and Penrith local government areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I would like to make is that people have a right to be informed. Here I was, the Labor candidate and the deputy mayor of the city of Blacktown, and I had no knowledge of the waste being stored there, even though officials had said it was a matter on the public record. They have to do more than say that is a matter on the public record. They have to take a pro-active role and inform people. If they have these substances in their midst, people have a right to know about it. I very much resented the approach of those officials in making those statements. Regretfully, I have to say to the House that part of the solution was seen as establishing a national repository for such waste. We seem to be no closer to that today than we were some 10 1/2 years ago, and I think that is a matter of regret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to talk about the move of the Emerton branch of the Commonwealth Bank to the new shopping centre at Plumpton. It is true that Coles and a number of other shops in the Emerton shopping centre have closed down. Paul Gibson, the state member for Londonderry, shifted his office from Emerton to Plumpton. But the people who use that facility, particularly the ordinary people&mdash;not so much the business customers&mdash;really are not being given a choice. We have to develop a set of community service obligations for the banks so that we can guarantee ordinary Australians access to what I would call basic banking services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no conditions on the licences that we grant to banks. They are licences granted in perpetuity. Why cannot we follow the United States model and have renewal hearings? Why cannot we make these licences for four or five years and call banks to account for their operations? Some may say, `That's just grandstanding or bank bashing.' That may very well be the case. But these large organisations provide an essential community service. Employers demand that their employees have a bank account. The Commonwealth government demands that its recipients have a bank account. You do not have a choice as to whether you want to have a bank account, so there ought to be a level of service that is guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These organisations seem to believe that they are beyond public accountability. I do not think they are beyond public accountability. I say to any organisation&mdash;whether it be a bank, a Commonwealth department or a private enterprise institution&mdash;you cannot get too close to your customers; you cannot know your customers too well. Part of that accountability process ought to be licence renewal hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time left to me, I want to briefly make a few remarks about the secessionist moves by the Kingswood campus of the University of Western Sydney. I have often spoken in this place about the University of Western Sydney, particularly when we were struggling to get it established. It goes without saying that I am totally opposed to this dismemberment of the federation that constitutes the University of Western Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have to say that Gillian Maling, the chief executive officer of the Kingswood campus, is a personal friend of mine. I agree with her on a lot of things, but sometimes I have disagreed with her in the past. I have a great deal of regard for her. I do not believe that you solve problems by seeking the resignation or dismissal of the chief executive officer of the Kingswood campus of the University of Western Sydney. I would say to the board of governors, the vice-chancellor and the chancellor that they ought to indulge in meaningful discussions with all the campuses, particularly the Kingswood campus, about their desires to go their separate ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate in this place that I am steadfastly against splitting the University of Western Sydney. Penrith got not only the Kingswood CAE but also the main campus upgraded to a university. It is totally abhorrent, if not somewhat deceitful, that those same people should now say, `The main campus remains at Penrith but we want Kingswood to be autonomous.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This university means too much to the people, particularly the young people, of Western Sydney to compromise, tarnish or otherwise inhibit its development. Let us have these discussions. Let us meet to sort out our problems. I think it is too early to sever the federation. I am not saying that might not be a question or an issue in the future. These things are not immutable. But, given its short history, I very much deprecate the moves of the Kingswood campus. I also regret the heavy-handed approach by the board of governors and the vice-chancellor. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hundreds of thousands of Australians invest in shares each year to provide for their income and future security. It is an activity which also adds to savings and investment in the future of this nation. Many of these people who make those investments in shares are senior Australians&mdash;some of them elderly, some infirm and some relatively unsophisticated in their knowledge of the legal and company complexities concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, it is important that all investors, particularly the elderly and those who do not have a comprehensive grasp of legal documentation, have faith in the integrity of the regulatory system. It is equally important that those who seek to prey on the susceptibilities of people are identified and rooted out of the system. It is in this  context that I wish to bring to the attention of the House today the activities of the firm Country Estate and Agency Co. Pty Ltd; the firm National Exchange Pty Ltd; and a Mr David Tweed, who is listed in documentation as the director of both of these companies. This matter has been raised with me by my constituents. I wish to quote from a letter I received recently from one constituent, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This issue first came to my attention some 12 to 18 months ago when in the course of assisting my elderly father with his affairs I noticed he was receiving a number of letters from Country Estate &amp; Agency Company Pty. Ltd. offering to purchase shares that he held in various companies at prices substantially below the current market price for such shares. The correspondence which my father received and the accompanying Standard Transfer form appeared to me to be aimed at unsuspecting elderly or frail shareholders and designed primarily to take advantage of such people. In early 1994 I spoke to and in fact wrote to a number of departments including The Australian Securities Commission, the Office for Aged Care and The Health and Community Services Office. I was concerned at the time that the actions of the Country Estate &amp; Agency Company Pty. Ltd. verged on the fraudulent and were at the very least abhorrent.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears that Mr. Tweed, a Director of Country Estate &amp; Agency Company Pty. Ltd., relies upon the entitlement of every person to obtain a copy of a company's share register and armed with that information approaches share holders with offers to purchase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My father received a number of these offers from Country Estate &amp; Agency Pty. Ltd. and after his death in December, 1994 such letters have been received by myself and other recipients of shares from his Estate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also now quite common to receive correspondence from companies advising share holders that a copy of the share register has been supplied to Country Estate &amp; Agency Company Pty. Ltd. and warning share holders that an approach may be made to them by this company to purchase their shares and advising that independent advice should be obtained before accepting any such offers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have also now learned that there was a David Tweed who was a well known financial writer/commentator who now lives overseas. The person who now calls himself David Tweed and who is a Director of Country Estate &amp; Agency Company Pty. Ltd. on my information changed his name to David Tweed presumably for the purpose of taking advantage of the reputation of another.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on. I will not go into the other details that support that claim. Since then I have received from a number of companies copies of letters in which they have advised their shareholders that National Exchange Pty Ltd has made offers to selected shareholders to purchase their shares at prices substantially below the market price. For example, North Ltd said in a letter to its shareholders on 28 February 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">North is very concerned about the activities of Country Estate and urges you to consider very carefully any offer which you might receive from them to purchase your shares. If you are in any doubt you should consult your financial adviser or stockbroker before accepting any such offer.</PARA>
<PARA>North also stated in its letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In April last year the Australian Securities Commission issued a media release noting various concerns which had been expressed to it about the activities of Country Estate, including a concern that "purchase offers have deliberately targeted elderly and unsophisticated investors". Those concerns led to the Australian Securities Commission revising the conditions on Country Estate's dealers licence.</PARA>
<PARA>To put this in context, the letter which was sent to North's shareholders with the signature of Mr David Tweed says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disclosure: the offer price has been calculated by taking into consideration Country Estate's view of management performance. Whether the price of the stock is expected to be more or less volatile than the market average, the expected degree of volatility of the market as a whole, the future uncertainties relating to the company, the market and otherwise and the costs of this offer.</PARA>
<PARA>By making a reference to `the future uncertainties relating to the company' there is a suggestion that in some way there has been some mismanagement on the part of the directors of the company and there is an implication that it is somehow conducting its business in an inefficient or inappropriate manner. This ought to be taken into account by the shareholder recipients of this letter who are getting offers to sell their shares to this particular company at a price substantially below the market price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the shareholders of North Ltd that have had these sorts of letters directed at them. Normandy Poseidon Ltd wrote a letter on 3 April to its shareholders advising them in similar terms. I noticed in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on Saturday 10 June 1995 Wesfarmers was giving a warning to its shareholders. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wesfarmers has told its shareholders that Country Estate &amp; Agency Company Pty Ltd had sent letters offering to buy Wesfarmers shares for $6.50, which was $2.26, or 26 per cent, below the market price of $8.76 a share.</PARA>
<PARA>The article also contains a quote from Mr Perkins of Wesfarmers. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We at Wesfarmers are very concerned . . . that Country Estate has made these offers to achieve a large financial gain at the cost of our shareholders and without any regard whatsoever to the interests of our shareholders . . . We strongly advise that under any circumstances you should ignore these below-market offers from Country Estate.</PARA>
<PARA>Last Saturday in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> there was another warning. This time it was from Bridgestone Australia to its shareholders. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASC said Country Estate, under the heading "disclosure", had advised that "the offer price is 90 cents below the market price of $1.50".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This statement is clearly incorrect and is likely to mislead investors, the ASC said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASC is concerned that the information set out by Country Estate &amp; Agency could cause Bridgestone shareholders to suffer substantial losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASC said the company's share price at the time of the offer was $2.40 and from early May to 15 June had not closed below $2.25.</PARA>
<PARA>This article relates to an offer by Country Estate to buy their shares at $1.50 which it compared to a market price of $2.40. In speaking to directors and company secretaries what appears clear is that Mr Tweed, and the companies of which he is a director, is entitled under the law, if they pay a sufficient price, to obtain the register of shareholders of a company and then build a profile of shareholders, particularly those who have small holdings in a variety of companies, and therefore target a certain type of shareholder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, they can exclude the institutional shareholders and concentrate on individuals. By putting a profile together they are able to say which shareholders fit into a certain category and they are able to target them. Given that it costs something like $3,500 to obtain the register of shareholders of a company such as North you can see that a substantial profit is involved should enough people pay this sort of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that the ASC said, in its response following the North action, that it had received over 200 complaints about the company's activities and actually revised the licence conditions for Country Estate. It said that it expected that every licence dealer would act honestly, efficiently and fairly and comply with the provisions of the Corporations Law. These latest instances, particularly the one concerning Bridgestone, suggest that that is not being done. It points to a systematic program by Country Estate and Mr Tweed to prey upon the susceptible and the vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As such, this is a parasitic blight on the market system. I call on the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Australian Securities Commission to take effective action, given this continuing breach of what might be regarded as fair and reasonable conduct in these circumstances. In the meantime, I warn all shareholders that, if they receive correspondence from these companies, they ought to dispatch it to the appropriate place&mdash;namely, the rubbish bin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the subject of the proposed social security agreement with the Hellenic Republic. These discussions between Greece and Australia have been going on for a few years and the government is to be congratulated for its serious and professional approach to this matter. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and his officers should be recognised by the Australian community for the good work that they have done so far. With the social security agreements that have been negotiated with other European countries, financially the benefit has been to Australia. The situation with Greece will probably mean that Australia will be out of pocket&mdash;so be it. What we lose on the swings we gain on the roundabouts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As things now stand the Australian Department of Social Security pays about $60 million to about 8,000 pensioners in Greece. The payment of Greek pensions in Australia is quite small. These 8,000 pensioners all earned their money through a life time of work in Australia. It is not unusual for people to return in their retirement to their place of birth. Not all do this, not even most, but some do and we should not begrudge them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears to me that this imbalance will remain. I think that we should not worry too much about this matter. The relations between Greece and Australia are old and very settled. We have gained immeasurably from Greek migration and we have given them a marvellous land in which to live. The war sealed the bonds between us in blood. I do not think that we should always keep in mind these past bonds. We are a nation of people, Australia is not a proprietary limited company. Money must not be the sole decider of decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These 8,000 retirees who returned to Greece did not do so from a feeling of animus towards Australia. Quite the contrary, I have never met a Greek who is not a fierce loyalist to this land. The Greek people are certainly smart enough to know that we have built a great country here&mdash;with their help&mdash;and they are smart enough to know that they belong here. The psychology that affects some old people is not a reflection on their attitudes to Australia. We must be conscious of these matters and take these unknowns into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call upon the Greek government to make every effort to sign an agreement on social security with the Australian government. The continued delays only allow an element of uncertainty to exist in the minds of retirees in both Australia and Greece. This is not helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that our social security system is essentially residence based, and I see the administrative reasons for this. I have no problem with this. However, it should always be interpreted in a helpful manner. I also understand that, with or without an agreement, Australia will continue to meet its obligations to Greek-Australian residents and to those who have returned to live out their retirement in Greece. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This notwithstanding, it is better if all these arrangements and agreements are incorporated in a formal social security agreement. The matter is causing a great deal of unease. I am constantly making representations to both the department and the Minister for Social Security. I am happy to do this because I know that relations between Australia and Greece, being as strong as they are, will not be damaged by the continued delays to which I have previously referred. I wish that these delays would end, and I am working to bring this about. I believe that both governments are working towards this&mdash;and both are working in good faith. I will be doing everything in my power to ensure that the Australian government facilitates its end of the bargain in signing this agreement. I would also ask that 1995 see the signing of this agreement to the mutual benefit of the citizens of both Australia and Greece. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter I would also raise is the grave situation in Cyprus. Cyprus as a member of the Commonwealth is now in its 21st year of division due to the illegal presence of the Turkish army in its northern part. The 1974 invasion of Cyprus by Turkey has never been recognised, and the Turkish republic of northern Cyprus is the Rhodesia of the Mediterranean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australian citizens lost their property in this 1974 invasion&mdash;that property being mainly real estate. The property remains intact and recoverable. I think that our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-General's Department should realise the central position held by property in our society and activate themselves to protect Australian property which was illegally seized in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment there is no Australian financial assistance for Australian citizens who in 1974 were displaced from their property. One of the departments has said that at the international level the only way that the property question can be resolved is in the context of an overall political solution. This seems an especially hopeless piece of hand-wringing, and the matter in relation to Australia is very simple. Turkish officials have allowed the theft of Australian owned property, and this theft is ongoing and must stop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not calling for the Turkish army to allow these Australian property owners to return to their property; this is a political matter. Australia has no political involvement in the Cyprus matter, nor should it have. What I am calling for is for Australian owned property to be in the control of a trust, established in Turkey and run by Australian officials from Ankara. My demand is connected purely to property and not politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent months the climate of opinion has moved further against Turkey. The European Court of Human Rights, on 23 March 1995, ruled that Turkey is liable for human rights violation in the Turkish occupied northern part of the island of Cyprus. This decision follows on the heals of a decision made by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg in July 1994. This ruling established in law the complete illegality of the Turkish republic of northern Cyprus and declared that Turkey was the actual, although illegal, power in that territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With these serious legal precedents established, Australia should take a stand, on behalf of its own citizens, on the principle of property rights. As a way of doing this, I call upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to consider giving financial assistance to a class action by Australian property owners in European courts to recover effective control of their property. I re-emphasise that I am not involving myself in the politics of the matter. The solution is a Turkish-European one and does not involve Australia. My suggestion concerns court costs and Australian property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a certain degree of responsibility to Australians outside of Australia. We cannot simply wash our hands of our own citizens when they go abroad&mdash;and I might point out that it is estimated that the property is worth in excess of $1 billion. We have not washed our hands of people, as has been demonstrated in the case of James Peng in China. Similarly, we must also stand by our citizens when Turkey is the offending party. I urge both ministers to carefully examine this suggestion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to grieve and make comment for a number of my constituents today. The first grievance I would bring to the attention of the House is of a constituent of mine who suffers from a rare and unusual form of leukemia&mdash;a disease potentially curable by the use of a drug called cladribine which has a treatment cost of some $4,500. The appalling situation is that in-patients in private hospitals are eligible for an authority to prescribe, with the cost largely being met as a general pharmaceutical benefits item. If ever you do not have private health insurance, which is the case with my constituent, then the only amount available to you if treated in a public hospital&mdash;that is, under casemix fee&mdash;is about $600.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XT4">Mr RONALDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not be too cocky, if I were you, my friend, because this is a fight between the Commonwealth and the state. Because of the large gap between the casemix fee and the drug cost, prescribing doctors in Victorian hospitals have been denied the use of this drug for patients urgently in need of it. Also, treating doctors have been encouraged to write PBS prescriptions which can be filled by outside pharmacies&mdash;a procedure that may breach the Medicare agreement. You talk about the state government. Indeed, your government will pay for it if you are treated in a private hospital. But if you do not have the money to take out private health insurance, then you do not have access to it. So I suggest that you listen and learn before you make ignorant comments such as that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Jenkins)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! The honourable member for Ballarat will address his remarks through the chair, and the honourable member for McEwen will cease interjecting. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XT4">Mr RONALDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is a matter that should be of great concern to all members, not just me. My constituent's treating doctor, Dr Richard Bell, has quite rightly said that doctors feel it is iniquitous and unjust that the Commonwealth will pay for these medications via the authority prescription mechanism in one circumstance&mdash;that is, in a non-public hospital setting&mdash;but that no adequate provisions are made for public hospitals and their patients in the same clinical circumstances. So if you are in a public hospital, you will get $600 out of $4,500 back. If your doctor is prepared to break the law and prescribe the purchase of the drug from outside sources via the pharmacies, then you can get it&mdash;but the doctor is then at risk. However, if you can afford private health insurance, you can go into a private hospital and get that treatment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely&mdash;and I put this on behalf of all members and all people who have this disease, which is curable&mdash;commonsense must prevail between the Commonwealth and the state in relation to the amount of refund that can be obtained by people with this disease. It is a horrible disease but it can be cured, although it seems to depend on your means as to whether or not you can get access to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also bring a matter to the attention of the House relating to&mdash;and the honourable member with whom I previously had a discussion will be aware of this area&mdash;Hepburn, a new part of my electorate. An extraordinarily hard working group had a raffle&mdash;and I am sure honourable members will be amazed at this&mdash;which was the largest raffle I think of any footy club in Australia where 2,000 tickets were sold at $200 per ticket. They were oversubscribed and actually had to send 200 tickets back. This small group of about five people sold tickets all over Australia. Really, it was a stunning performance. For those of you who are mechanically minded, the first prize was a Kenworth T900 valued at $233,500, the second prize was a Harley Davidson motorcycle valued at $25,000, and the third prize was $10,000 worth of petrol.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today on behalf of members of the Serbian community in Melbourne. Last week they forwarded to the Speaker's office a petition signed by a large number of their community in Melbourne drawing their concerns to the attention of this House. Due to an error in the drafting of the petition, it was unable to be tabled in this House as a petition. So today, in the grievance debate, it is my intention to read to the House the grievances of the Serbian community of Victoria. The petition states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain honourable citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that Mr Franjo Tudjman, President of Croatia, has been invited to visit Australia during June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>As this House is well aware, the President of Croatia, Mr Tudjman, arrived in this country yesterday. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The undersigned citizens object against Mr Tudjman's visit because he:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Ordered and/or authorised the attack on the Western Slavonija region, including Jasenovac, on 1st and 2nd of May during which some 4000 fleeing Serbian refugees were massacred by Croatian ground and air forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2 Authored the book "Wastelands: The Confusion of Historical Truth" in which he repudiates the holocaust against the Jews and claims that the genocide carried out during World War II by the Croats against Serbs, Gypsies and Jews at the Jasenovac Death Camp (in Western Slavonija) was a myth contrary to historical truth.</PARA>
<PARA>We can well understand the Serbian community in Victoria drawing the attention of this House to their concerns on the visit of Mr Tudjman. The petition continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore dutifully pray that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.the House refuses entry to Mr Franjo Tudjman into Australia;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.the Australian Government uses its influence at the United Nations and all other international forums and conventions to stop further Croat aggression against the Serbian people . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It refers to other similar matters. Whilst I would pray in this parliament that the Bosnian Serbs, the Serbs, the Croats and the Muslims of former Yugoslavia lay down their arms and meet around the negotiating table&mdash;and I would urge them to do that very quickly&mdash;nevertheless, it is fair to say that, for many Australians of Serbian descent and for many Australians of Jewish descent and of Jewish persuasion, the book that was written by Mr Tudjman is offensive. I have read extracts of the book, and I personally find it offensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The book does deny what is regarded by most people as historical fact. It does suggest that the great slaughter that occurred in what is now known as the Holocaust in what was then known as Yugoslavia in the Second World War was the fault of the Jewish people. I reject that totally as a human being and I reject it totally on the basis of the evidence I have read. I say that that which occurred in Jasenovac was murder, was slaughter, upon innocent people, be they Jewish, gypsy, Yugoslav or Russian. It was slaughter. It was not acceptable then; it is not acceptable now. I have great trouble with any person who tries to excuse in any way, shape or form by revisionist history the facts of that which occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of both the Jewish community and the Serbian community of Melbourne, I believe it is appropriate that those concerns be made in this House today. But, again, I would stress my own personal view: whilst I reject the revisionist history of the Holocaust by whomsoever may care to write such revisionism, I plead that in the former Yugoslavia the United Nations can, through its good graces, get to the negotiating table those people who see that the only resolution to political and social conflict is through the force of arms and that it can get them to stop using heavy weapons to slaughter innocent women and children, the aged, the infirm and the ill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who watches television and has seen hospitals in Sarajevo, as one example, where people are defenceless and where people of goodwill are trying to repair the damage caused elsewhere, will be horrified and will bleed internally for the pain and suffering that many of these people are undergoing. I hope that the Croats, the Bosnian Muslims, the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs generally can very shortly, through the graces of the United Nations, resolve this great conflict. I am sure all in this House would join me in urging this course of action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to question time, I commenced my speech on this debate. I was discussing the observations of the French foreign minister which were reported in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two decisions, one to resume a few tests . . . and a second [that] from May 1996 France will stop testing forever.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the nations of the South Pacific, which have been asking for that for a very long time, should rather be rejoicing by saying that overall, the second decision is far more important than the first.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that demonstrates the utter arrogance of the French government in dealing with this issue. It also shows the contempt which it has shown the nations of the South Pacific&mdash;including Australia&mdash;in its proposals to continue to test nuclear weapons in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth reminding ourselves very briefly that these tests are repugnant for a range of reasons, not the least of which is their environmental impact. An article entitled `Poisoned Pacific: The legacy of French nuclear testing' by Bengt Danielsson was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</EMPHASIS>. It went into some detail about the issue of these tests. I suggest that, after reading this article, we would realise why the French are so opposed to having these tests on their home ground. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The full extent of the leakage of radionuclides into the ocean is unknown, mainly because technicians have been unwilling and unable to undertake studies at the depths where the explosions take place.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even more shocking, the French National Radiation Laboratory, which measures the radioactive pollution of the environment, the food, and the population in France, has never been allowed to send any experts to French Polynesia.</PARA>
<PARA>What does that say about the safety or otherwise of these particular tests? The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There seems little doubt that leakage from the underground testing initiated in 1976 has lead to irradiation of the sea fauna around Moruroa, and that many contaminated fish, shellfish, squids, and sea turtles have been consumed by the inhabitants of nearby islands. But a greater danger to the health of Pacific islanders in a more extended radius is the plutonium waste dispersed by typhoons.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think I need to explain the environmental problems that are caused by these nuclear tests in the Pacific. The proposals by the French stand condemned. We just have to take our minds back to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rainbow Warrior</EMPHASIS> affair to remind ourselves of the absolute contempt with which the French have treated opposition by South Pacific nations to these tests. These tests have been an absolute political disaster for the Polynesians who are most directly affected by them. It has meant the continuation of colonial regimes in the South Pacific by the French just so they could, at their pleasure, decide when, if, how and how often they might explode nuclear weapons. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IJ4">Mr SNOWDON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is sick. It demonstrates very clearly why the parliament is required to show our concerns with a united voice directly to the French government. As I said earlier, this is the 50th anniversary of the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go to the amendment being proposed by the opposition. I say to the opposition that, of the first two proposals before the House, it is very clear that, in large part, they are being carried out in any event. They are basically superfluous because the government is taking those appropriate actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is a proposal that we recall the ambassador. The opposition should understand that the ambassador will in all likelihood be returning to Australia next week in any event. So I am not quite sure what the purpose of recalling the ambassador would be. In any event, I do not think at this point in time it is an appropriate response to the discussions we are seeking to have with the French government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second last paragraph of the amendment states `to show depth of our concern . . .  including action in the United Nations condemning French nuclear testing as a gross abuse of colonial power', and so on. I have no personal opposition to those proposals. In fact, they might well be the response which is arrived at after appropriate discussion and consultation with the South Pacific Forum leadership. That is, after all what the Prime Minister has said the government is committed to doing. If, after the discussions with the French President this evening in Paris, it is clear that we need to have a further discussion with the South Pacific Forum leaders and that a further response is required, this might well be the nature of a response which would be appropriate at that time. But it is rather pre-emptive, given that the discussions with the French have not taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition, unlike the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), is not in a position to know what the leadership of the South Pacific Forum countries wants to do post the discussions with the French. Until we have those discussions with the French, it would be absolutely asinine and quite stupid, in my view, for us to proceed with this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final proposal is that we `discuss with the USA the possibility of data sharing to remove the public French excuse for the tests'. Are we going to say to the French that they must do certain things? How are we going to compel the French to undertake a sharing of information with the United States and vice versa? After all, if the United States were to provide open access by the French to their information, far from retarding the process of nuclear development in France it would in all likelihood enhance it, because the French would have more information than they likely have at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I can understand the intent, at least in terms of political opportunism, of the opposition for some of these amendments, the proposals are in fact either being undertaken by the government in some form or, alternatively, are prejudging the outcome of meetings which are about to be had and further discussions which the Prime Minister has already foreshadowed he will have with the South Pacific Forum leaders. Lastly, I think the proposal for data sharing is, as I said, rather absurd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go to the political opportunism of the opposition. I conclude my brief address to this debate by just bringing to the public's attention the hypocritical cant coming from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the shadow minister for foreign affairs (Mr Downer). The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty is based on the support of South Pacific countries for the following broad principles. It is important that the public understands what they are. They state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)To be free to live in peace and independence and to run their own affairs in accordance with the wishes and traditions of their people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)To enjoy peaceful social and economic development free from the threat of environmental pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)To acknowledge existing international treaties and organisations such as the Charter of the United Nations, the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which contribute to these principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)To act in accordance with applicable international principles and treaties, notably the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons with respect to nuclear activities and to take into account other regional arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)To retain their unqualified sovereign rights to decide for themselves, consistent with their support for these principles, their security arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>Under its terms, the parties pledge to each other:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)Not to possess, manufacture, or acquire nuclear explosive devices anywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)To prevent in their territory the testing of any nuclear explosive device and to prevent the stationing of any nuclear device in their territory.</PARA>
<PARA>Understand that. It is very important. The treaty further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)To take measures, including the application of full-scope International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)Not to dump radioactive waste and other radioactive matter at sea in the zone . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what the French are doing. But what did the Leader of the Opposition say about that in this House in 1986? What did the present shadow minister for foreign affairs say about that at that time? The Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not believe that that arrangement has made this part of the world a more peaceful or more secure one. We believe the Government has an overoptimistic view of the benefits . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The present shadow minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that this legislation and this Treaty are an over-reaction to the French testing at Mururoa.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement is quite interesting because France's opposition to that testing was, we believe, long focused on the question of nuclear tests. French statements and publications in the 1980s attacked the treaties of Raratonga as a political instrument designed first and foremost to put a stop to French nuclear testing in the Pacific. That is what we said. But what did the present shadow minister say? He said that too, but he ran the French line&mdash;not the line of the Australian community and not the line of the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should oppose the opposition's amendment. I would ask the opposition to come and support the proposals of the government. Let us ensure that there is a strong, uniform voice from this country to the French so that they fully appreciate and understand the importance of our feelings on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I tell the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) that, of course, if after our amendment has been considered, the motion proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is to be the subject of a vote, it will be the subject of a vote with the support of the opposition. That has been made clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I think is so disappointing in this debate is that the government is now indicating quite clearly that the amendment, which was intended as a helpful and constructive amendment, proposed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), will be rejected in this parliament today with the government voting against each and every one of those additional propositions. I believe that approach of the government is fraught with difficulty for it and will be an approach condemned strongly in the eyes of the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not seen an issue which has galvanised in quite the same way the support of the Australian community as has the opposition to these particular tests. What the Australian public is striving for is not words in the form of platitudes which are mouthed merely to put a view to the French which they can easily reject but, rather, definitive steps taken by the government and the Australian people which will have an impact upon France and the French people. That, I think, is the overwhelming desire of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a letter faxed to me by Sherry Stumm of Dangar Island, a very delightful centre, a very small place in the Hawkesbury River just north of Brooklyn. She is part of the Write-on Group and she wrote to me these lines. I would hope the member for the Northern Territory notes this. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not a time for party politics. It is, as John Howard said, a time for both houses of parliament and all parliamentarians to stand united against the arrogance and stupidity of the French.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want you to urge the government to do more than diplomatic representation.</PARA>
<PARA>I think this is what is in the nature of the government's motion. She goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have suggested to Mr Keating in a letter to him today that Australia with other South Pacific rim nations, urge their citizens to send a flotilla of craft of every kind to support Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior in the waters off Mururoa Atoll.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are a small nation and we can boycott French products, but all our actions are but a drop in the ocean. However we can win the PR war for world opinion by encouraging such a flotilla of craft to convene on the island to mark the anniversary of D Day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would capture world attention, for it is a visual demonstration, is reminiscent of the defiance and courage of those in the D Day invasion when craft of every shape and kind took to the English Channel to liberate France and repel the Nazis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think symbols such as unity, courage and as Martin Luther King and Gandhi were aware, giant mobilisations of peoples in opposition, can have a remarkable effect.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say I regarded that as a positive and thoughtful contribution for people to note. But it seems to me that positive ideas, additional steps that might be taken beyond the mere bureaucratic jargon, are being simply put off by the government and government members as steps that are inappropriate. I find it extraordinary that the propositions by the Leader of the Opposition can be condemned by the government in the way in which the member for the Northern Territory, a parliamentary secretary, speaking for the government can suggest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The propositions were: that we join with New Zealand and suspend military cooperation with France, except for surveillance, United Nations and humanitarian activities; that we cease refuelling all French non-humanitarian military transit flights; that we recall the Australian ambassador to show the depth of our concern and to develop, in association with the South Pacific Forum, a regional plan of action to embarrass and, if possible, hinder French nuclear testing, including action in the United Nations condemning French nuclear testing as a gross abuse of colonial power and, along with similar tests by the People's Republic of China, as a gross violation of the world environment; and, finally, discuss with the United States the possibility of data sharing to remove the French excuse for tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting when arguments were being mounted against each of those propositions that it was put in the context of awaiting discussions between the foreign minister of France and the delegation that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) was leading there today. What the parliamentary secretary was suggesting was that all we had to do was to put off developing any further steps which might demonstrate some leadership on Australia's part to await some views that might be distilled through the use of the forum. In the words of the parliamentary secretary, it would depend upon the views of the forum as to whether or not we adopt those propositions. Is it not interesting that all we were seeking in the first paragraph was that we join with New Zealand, which is already arguing for the suspension of military cooperation with France?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the refuelling of French non-humanitarian military transit flights, what view of other countries would be relevant to our adopting that position? In fact I think most of the forum countries would be more than happy that we would deal with something within our own purview. In relation to recalling our ambassador, it was in the context that it would enable that dialogue with the South Pacific Forum in which we would be able to get other views that would assist him. Recalling the Australian ambassador, it seems to me, is not a step that we need to wait for the South Pacific Forum to give us a clue as to what steps we should take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to dialogue with the United States of America, again, it is a matter in which we are involved in data sharing and in which much of the South Pacific would not be likely to be involved. This idea that these matters can be put off the agenda until we get a steer from the South Pacific Forum is just one further way of demonstrating that this government has lost touch with the views of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I want to address in this debate today is the historical circumstances in which we are discussing this issue. It is very interesting that government members have been delving back into the past to try to find statements by opposition members upon which they can find some comfort for the views that they are adopting on this very issue. I have to say that going back to views of people in the 1980s to try to justify the government's position in the 1990s is of no relevance or consequence at all. As anyone who has studied world affairs would know, quite significant changes have occurred since many of those utterances were made. The fact is that that was a time in which we were involved in the so-called Cold War&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that time there were quite different perceptions of the world then than there is today. The fact is that, when you have had the changed public opinion that has occurred in relation to nuclear weapons with the undertakings that both the United States and the Soviet Union have given to each other with the progressive disarmament that has taken place, you are in a much more secure environment than you are now. So the very arguments which may have justified French nuclear testing and which may have justified a government giving the French some solace in relation to those efforts are of no currency today when the arguments that might have been advanced then had some validity. That is the very point that needs to be understood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It brings us to the point that needs to be asked: why is it that Australia, represented by Senator Gareth Evans as its foreign minister, is taking this approach of appeasement on this important issue? Why is it that Australia now has to be seen to be developing arguments on a matter that is of such importance to Australia and its people as well as to the people of the South Pacific? When you look at our record, on a whole host of issues today you can understand what Senator Gareth Evans is involved in. He wants to keep his options open in relation to his walk on the international stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have been walking away from our longstanding and I think properly critical approach of many country's human rights records, Senator Gareth Evans has now been saying, `Wait. Think about how these matters might affect our ability to be elected as a member of the Security Council,' and, `Wait. Think about how Australia is going to be seen by some of the countries in our own region if we take a vigorous and critical approach to, say, the issue of East Timor.' That is a matter which many government members feel quite strongly about. I would have to say to government members that if you have some concern about Australia's reputation in the world, if you have some concern about the way in which we are seen on issues relating to human rights, if you have some concern as to the way in which we are seen on this particular issue of French nuclear testing, you would be prepared to put Australia and Australia's interests before the interests of the foreign minister and his walk on the international stage. </PARA>

We all know his barely concealed ambitions in that direction. It is so clear, is it not, that, when he has to comment on these matters, he does so now as one who would have to represent wider interests, particularly the wider interests of western Europe, and particularly those of the French, who find it convenient to test nuclear weapons in somebody else's backyard, even though they claim it to be a part of France, rather than in provincial France itself. </PARA>

Given the fact that today the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), with the delegation from the South Pacific Forum, is going to see President Chirac, and although President Chirac has indicated in the media that he is not willing to bend, it would be premature to take some of the actions that the opposition is suggesting.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra talked about the need for definitive steps.

I certainly think that the government&mdash;me and other members of the government&mdash;will be calling for other steps if Senator Evans's diplomatic ventures in Paris come to nothing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's motion accurately reflects the outrage that the Australian population feels at France's decision. There is no doubt that there is outrage felt in the Australian population and there is no doubt about the comments that have been made by previous participants in this debate&mdash;the fact that France, although it says the tests are safe, refuses to test in metropolitan France and the sheer arrogance of testing, in what amounts to colonies, with total disregard for the indigenous population. All these things have been said and will continue to be said in this debate. They have to be said. The purpose of this motion is to condemn the French government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent the electorate of Leichhardt in Far North Queensland. Although this issue is, of course, of concern not only to all Australians but to all people in the South Pacific&mdash;and, I hope, in the world community&mdash;it is of particular concern to people in Cairns in my electorate in Far North Queensland. It is well worth remembering that during the period in which France conducted its atmospheric nuclear tests Australia maintained a comprehensive program for monitoring radioactive fallout resulting from the tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise in saying this that the currently suggested tests are underground tests but I think this is still relevant. The fallout monitoring program included measurements of concentration of iodine 131 in the nine major Australian milk suppliers to establish average internal radiation from iodine 131 to the thyroid for those consuming fresh milk in Australia. Here I quote from the Australian government submission to the International Court of Justice. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The French nuclear tests from 1966 to 1972 have resulted in increased radiation doses to the Australian population, both externally from fallout deposited underground and internally from the consumption of milk and other foodstuffs contaminated by iodine 131, caesium 137, strontium 90, carbon 14 and tritium.</PARA>
<PARA>In that period concentrations of iodine 131 were measured in milk supplies in a figure called picocurie days per litre. That is very significant. Malanda, which is not in my electorate but is near my electorate on the Atherton tableland, supplies milk to a lot of northern Australia&mdash;not only to North Queensland but also to the Northern Territory. The Malanda figures&mdash;and I give them in picocuries&mdash;were as follows: in 1966, 11,000; 1967, 10,360; 1968, 4,540; 1970, 5,790; 1971, 5,390; 1972, 170. Those figures alone are alarming, and the whole of Australia's figures were alarming. I will give the same figures very briefly for Hobart. They were 1,500, 380, 790, 860, 350, and 0 in the last year. Even in Brisbane the figures were 4,600, 940, 2,250, 13,020 and 1,360. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the effect on contamination of milk, it is very clear that the north of Australia suffered more from those nuclear tests than did the rest of Australia. If you draw a line directly from Cairns into the Pacific, straight across the Pacific, you come to French Polynesia. Obviously the north of Australia is very concerned about the resumption of tests by the French in French Polynesia. In my electorate of Leichhardt there is a great concern about these issues. In Far North Queensland we also understand very well even minor effects on coral reefs, so one could imagine what effect underground nuclear tests would have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I urge the House to support the Prime Minister's motion. I know my electorate in Far North Queensland will be voicing its opinion in many ways. I will be addressing a rally, which I am helping to organise, on Sunday in Cairns because of the importance of this issue. I urge that the House accept the motion of the Prime Minister and reject the amendment by the coalition, not because it does not contain measures that might be necessary in the future but because it is premature and it really does not address the current issues. Give the negotiations in Paris a chance and give the South Pacific leaders&mdash;not only Senator Evans but the other Pacific leaders&mdash;in Paris a chance to convince France because that is really our only hope. I urge the House to adopt the motion of the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate we are having today is one which does unite the House, although there is a degree of disunity on the question of whether or not the government has taken the necessary action and whether the action it has taken is strong enough to make it quite clear internationally, and certainly in the context of Australia's bilateral relations with France, that we abhor in every respect the actions of the new French President in announcing the resumption of nuclear tests at Mururoa Atoll in the Pacific.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's relations with France, going back to at least the 1970s, have been constantly marred by the whole question of nuclear testing in the Pacific region. In 1971 at its first meeting the South Pacific Forum issued a strong statement against French nuclear testing. It is inappropriate, therefore, this year when Australia is the president of the South Pacific Forum, that the French government has once again determined, entirely in its own unilateral interests, to recommence nuclear testing in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason circumstances are different today from what they were in the past&mdash;and this point was totally ignored by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in response to questions today&mdash;is that, previously, the world was divided between East and West in what was known as the Cold War. In that context successive French governments, to support their policy of a force de frappe, which gave them an independent nuclear capability, insisted on their right and their need to conduct a series of atomic tests in the Pacific and, earlier than that, in the Sahara. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Circumstances in recent years have fundamentally changed. The Cold War is of the past. What we are looking at today is a new world environment in which it is hoped that there is simply no need for any nation, be it France or China, to resume nuclear testing as a means of ensuring its security. Today we are as concerned about maintaining an environment for collective security as we had during the 1950s, through to the 1990s, when, in the western European context, NATO was the organisation to which all Western nations were associated as a means of ensuring their long-term physical and political security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1971, Australia's relations with France have been constantly marred by the ever present spectre of French nuclear testing. On 9 May 1973, Australia and New Zealand instituted proceedings against France in the International Court of Justice in connection with the French nuclear tests in the Pacific region. I recall those details very clearly because here in Canberra I was associated with briefing the Australian delegation to the ICJ on how it should handle those very important discussions. The important thing is that the International Court of Justice in its judgment of June of the same year ordered that, pending its final decision in the case submitted to it in May, the French government should avoid nuclear tests causing the deposit of radioactive fallout on the territory of Australia, New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue or the Tokelau Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now one fundamental difference. At that stage we were talking about atmospheric tests; today we are talking about underground tests. Let there be no mistake about the fact that any tests, whether they be underground or in the atmosphere, carry with them a considerable health risk for the populations within the vicinity of those tests. It is no secret that the islander people of the west Pacific, who for generations have depended upon the sea as their source of food, are now effectively prevented from so doing. There is no doubting the fact that we have seen in Australia alone, according to the AMA, a potential for an increase in cancer as a result of nuclear testing in the South Pacific. The level of iodine 131 found in milk supplies and so forth, which came to international prominence a few years ago with the Chernobyl disaster in Russia, demonstrates the reality that it is so difficult to hermetically seal off any nuclear testing in any part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition now put to us by the new French government of President Chirac is that an additional eight tests are necessary, presumably to enable the French to test a new warhead, are eight tests we do not need for world security, are eight tests that, frankly, France does not need for its security, and are eight tests which no-one in the South Pacific needs for our health or for the sovereignty of our nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing we have to consider in this whole issue is that we as pro-Australians are not anti-French. We in this parliament are united in our determination to be against the specific policy of the current French government. But let me make it absolutely clear that no-one in this parliament should support the burning of French consulates, the destruction of French property and the attacking of Franco-Australian citizens in any respect. Regrettably, in recent weeks&mdash;and I think to some degree egged on by elements of the media&mdash;there has been a tendency for somewhat extravagant language to be used in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental fact is that President Chirac has determined a policy which we should have been aware of well before the event, because history teaches us that when Chirac was previously Prime Minister in earlier French governments the relationship between France and Australia was difficult for two reasons&mdash;firstly, because of our involvement in the determination that over time the French territories in the Pacific should be independent&mdash;</PARA>

The questions asked today by the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), of the Prime Minister were pertinent. `Why is it that the department of foreign affairs,' he asked, `has been so slow at initiating the necessary policy work to determine what the implications for Australia would be with the election of a Chirac presidency? What action was taken by the foreign minister ahead of the act to try to head off the French policy change?' Everybody who has examined this issue over recent years would know that there was a high probability that President Chirac's government would go back to the policy it has enunciated previously; that is, the right of the French government to develop an independent nuclear capability as the underpinning of its force de frappe approach to defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to understand that France's relationship with NATO, although it is a member, is fundamentally different from the relationship of all other members. While France accepts to a degree the concept of collective security, it believes that it has the right to defend its own sovereignty in the context of its defence policy. There is no question in this particular case that it has been prepared to go it alone, regardless of what anybody thinks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we in the opposition find most unfortunate and unacceptable is the general attitudinal change we have seen in the government's position over recent years. For example, in 1984 the then foreign minister, now the Governor-General, Mr Hayden, in a press release made this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . he had reaffirmed the Government's view that while the environmental and health effects of nuclear testing were important, the Government's dominant concern was that nuclear testing should not take place by any state in any environment.</PARA>
<PARA>That was his response to the report carried out following an inspection of Mururoa Atoll in that year. The press release also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . while he found reassuring the Report's conclusion that the levels of radioactive fallout were relatively low and that these levels do not lead to any expectation that radiation-induced diseases will be detectable, he was concerned at the Report's conclusion that leakage could occur from the detonation chambers in the long term and that the structural integrity of the coral limestones on the upper section of Mururoa Atoll had already been impaired.</PARA>
<PARA>That was back in 1984 and here we are, 11 year later, in 1995, being told that a further eight explosions are necessary to ensure France's defence integrity in terms of its atomic weapons. Nobody can guarantee us that the physiological integrity of those reefs will withstand another eight explosions. Nobody can assure the people living on those Pacific islands&mdash;New Zealanders, Australians or anybody else in the south-west Pacific&mdash;that our long-term health will not to one degree or another be impaired by a further eight nuclear explosions. This is what concerns us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned that the attitude that has been adopted by this government and the foreign minister has been less than forthright in making it absolutely clear to the French authorities that as a sovereign independent nation, as the current leader of the South Pacific Forum, Australia not only has a right but has a fundamental responsibility to make sure that every possible opportunity before the event&mdash;not after the event; it is too late then&mdash;is taken by the government to emphasise to the French authorities that we do not accept and we will not accept their attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">President Chirac claimed during the week that people were complaining that these explosions are not taking place in France. But they are, he said, because the islands of the South Pacific are French territory; ergo, they are part of France. That is a bit of Descartian logic that I think some would find rather quaint in today's world. The fact of the matter is that the Pacific is the other end of the earth from Paris. Frankly, too few people really care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We live here in the Pacific. Those islanders are looking to us for some support at this time. That is why the amendment that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is particularly pertinent in this debate. We have asked that `Australia join with New Zealand in the suspension of military cooperation with France; except for surveillance, United Nations and humanitarian activities'. We have asked that the refuelling of all French non-humanitarian military transit flights to Mururoa Atoll or to the French possessions in the Pacific be curtailed. We have asked for the recalling of the Australian ambassador `to show the depth of our concern, and to develop in association with the South Pacific Forum a Regional plan of action to embarrass and if possible hinder French nuclear testing'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reaction of the Keating government has been that this is all over the top, all too extreme. But, surely, this government should realise that public opinion in today's world is a very significant weapon. It is not good enough just making speeches. It is not good enough just sending your foreign minister across to Paris when he has gone under duress. The comments he made in Tokyo last week were not the comments of a foreign minister who was genuinely concerned about the issue, and they were certainly not the comments of a foreign minister concerned about how the Australian people saw what was happening in their part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, therefore, we have had to move this amendment because we believe it is of particular importance at this stage that the Australian people have confidence in their government and that every possible step be taken to emphasise to the French authorities in Paris our genuine concern. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commence my remarks by saying that I agree with the motion set out by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) today. I also support the addendum in the amendment put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). I want also to strongly associate myself with the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition in the House today about the condemnation of the act of wilful destruction that occurred in Perth over the weekend. It was an abhorrent, un-Australian act and one which was calculated to bring to this debate an element that all of us would wish to be kept out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to comment on the French government's decision to hold these tests. I believe the French government should reverse its decision. I condemn the testing in the Pacific, and many French people also disagree with the decision that has been made by the French government. Let us be absolutely clear that this is a French government decision. We should not blame the French people for the decision. If we did that, it would be a bit like blaming the people of Canberra for the deceit and broken promises of the Keating government. Blame should not be apportioned to the French people in toto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian people are very well respected in France. In fact, the sacrifices of Australians in defence of France have very few parallels in history. If there is one country to which we do have a right to express unapologetic and frank terms of anger, condemnation and contempt for the behaviour of its government, it is France. But in doing that I emphasise that the argument is with the political decision of the French government. I share to the full the Prime Minister's concern that there not be general anger directed at ordinary French people or at Australians of French descent living in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sweeping, broad statements that have been made condemning French people are quite inappropriate. However, their government must be made and held accountable for that decision. I want to make note of a comment made by the Australian junior foreign minister, as he was referred to, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), in my local paper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bendigo Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, on Monday 19 June. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the pressure is building up and I would certainly not discount the possibility that we may be able to modify the French stance in some way.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement is quite different from the out-of-touch, weak and pathetic response of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans. The response of Senator Evans was totally inadequate. He did not express the legitimate anger of the Australian people or, in fact, the Bendigo people whom he purports to represent. He is a senator for the whole of Victoria and has an office in the Bendigo area. From comments I have received I can assure honourable members that people in the Bendigo electorate are absolutely outraged at the decision by the French government. They have contacted me to call for a reversal of that decision and condemn further nuclear testing in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was impressed with the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition when he indicated that he would move amendments, to be put to the Australian parliament, and call for Australia, New Zealand and all Pacific nations, including Nauru, Western Samoa and Papua New Guinea, to register their disapproval and condemnation of further testing in the Pacific by the French government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment on the addendum which has been proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. The opposition believes that a number of additional steps ought to be taken by the government to add to the motion presently before the House. We propose that there be an addendum to the motion containing the following: first, that we join with New Zealand and suspend military cooperation with France, except for surveillance, United Nations and humanitarian activities; second, that we cease the refuelling of all French non-humanitarian military transit flights; third, that we recall the Australian Ambassador to show our depth of concern; and, fourth, that we develop, in association with the South Pacific Forum, a regional plan of action to embarrass and, if possible, hinder French nuclear testing, including action in the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That should strike a chord with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is aspiring to some position in the United Nations at some time. I believe that action in the United Nations condemning French nuclear testing as a gross abuse of colonial power and as a gross violation of the world environment should be followed up by the government. The final part of our addendum is that we will discuss with the United States the possibility of data sharing to remove the public French excuse for these nuclear tests which they are proposing to continue in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to give an indication to the coalition as to why it is not possible to attach these additional proposals to the motion that has been put before the House by the Prime Minister. I believe that the motion on French nuclear testing which the Prime Minister has put forward is very fitting, particularly the first two items which are very strong. Firstly, he condemns the decision of the government of France to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific and, secondly, calls on the French government to reverse its decision to resume testing. But the motion put forward by the Prime Minister does not go nearly far enough in registering the extreme anger felt by the Australian people and people throughout the Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the strength of all of those nations that I have mentioned&mdash;New Zealand, Nauru, Western Samoa and Papua New Guinea&mdash;people in that Pacific area should band together with the coalition in registering their support for the addendum which has been put forward by the coalition which would strengthen the motion that has been put before the House by the Prime Minister. There should be absolutely no reason why members of the government party on the other side of the House should not support the addendum in the amendment being put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was appalled at the actions that took place over the weekend. I know that every member of my party believes that it is abhorrent behaviour in Australia and is something which we do not require in Australia at all. The further amendment and additions to this motion, which have been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, will strengthen and portray the will of and the anger being felt by Australian people as a result of the French government's decision to do additional nuclear testing in the Pacific. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision by the French President to resume underground nuclear weapons testing on Mururoa Atoll is one that is abhorred by the vast majority of Australians. From my contact with French people in Australia, and representatives of French companies in Australia, I understand that the unilateral decision by the French President is also abhorred by the majority of French people, particularly the young who have a far greater reason to fear nuclear fallout than we do here in Australia. Living in a country that possesses a nuclear arsenal would not provide one with a feeling of comfort or of peace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate today that the opposition has elected to attempt to score cheap political points by demanding an extreme, knee-jerk reaction to a country that has shown itself to be a good ally, an honourable trading partner and a firm friend in peace and war. We should not overlook the fact that it was France that led the world in 1993 when it called a voluntary halt to nuclear testing, and that showed the way to the United States and to the Soviet republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely it is our duty as fellow global citizens to remind the people of France that we are their friends. We understand the pride that they must have felt in 1993 when their government broke new ground and called a halt to nuclear testing. We should remind them that their dogmatic and autocratic President has made an incorrect decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since we were advised of this immoral decision last week, I have made contact with many people and urged them to respond in a reasonable way. I have written to all of the schools in my electorate and asked them to select a school in France. I have asked them to try to pick a locality that is very much the same as their own so the children of that school can compose and send letters to their colleagues in France. They can remind them of our history of friendship and cooperation, of our involvement in both world wars. They may even have the grandchildren or great grandchildren of Australian veterans who fought in France and perhaps even died there. They could remind the French children of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could remind them of the pride that we had in being able to send a naval ship to rescue their lone round-the-world sailor, Isabelle Autissier. We could ask them to show their revulsion at the decision of their President. I believe that the circuit breaker in the whole of this is getting the French people to show that they also are responsible global citizens, and I believe they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have addressed the Trades Hall Council in Newcastle and asked them to contact the union leaders in France. France is a strong trade union nation. I have been contacted by Lions clubs because they are an international organisation. In Paris alone there are between 150 and 200 Lions clubs. I am sure they will respond. Rotary clubs also are an international organisation. All Rotary clubs in Australia should consider writing to Rotary clubs in France to remind them of our long history of association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have even had an advertising agency give me a quote on placing a full page ad in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Le Monde</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Le Figaro</EMPHASIS>. Because of the cost, we are now examining alternative methods of getting the feelings of Australian people understood by the citizens of France. After all, this is the year of tolerance. We should appeal to the French to tolerate our position, our feelings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly have not heard a lot of statements of tolerance espoused by the opposition today, either tolerance of the French or tolerance of the government. Let us compare the actions of this government with those of the opposition. On this side, we have been entirely consistent in our efforts to get the French President to understand our point of view. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been entirely consistent, even before this decision was made, having made contact with the new President of France on two occasions to advise him of the feelings of Australian people on and their opposition to nuclear testing. This government has a strong history of opposing nuclear testing in the South Pacific and anywhere else. That is our strength. That is our point of consistency. Compare that with the position of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at some of the things that some members of the opposition had to say last week. The shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Government should actively consider the New Zealand proposal which would involve sending an Australian frigate into the region to protest and monitor the tests.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think at this stage, what the Government has done is appropriate. I think that the New Zealanders have said they're not going to send a frigate, not for the time being but I think it's one of those things, you've got to keep the situation under continuing review. It's not a question of saying on day one, everything that should or shouldn't be done. It's a question of keeping different things under review.</PARA>
<PARA>Today must be his day one because the amendment he put today is certainly going to give all French people a feeling that suddenly Australians do not care for French people. I am sure that is not the feeling at all that any Australian wishes to convey. As I said at the start, I am convinced that the majority of French people find their President's decision as abhorrent as we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, let me just remind those opposite of a few other things. They might care to consider the response of the government of the country where our head of state resides. Its reaction has been to do nothing. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister of Great Britain has said, `Oh, I don't think we'll be too concerned about that.' There is no doubt that it is extremely unfortunate that the French have embarked on this decision. The way to resolve it is not by gunboat tactics or standover tactics. The President of France has already indicated that while he will allow foreign delegations to visit his country&mdash;he will even speak with them&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure. I am sure the President of France would tell the member for Mackellar exactly what he has told the rest of the world leaders: `I will listen but my decision is irrevocable.' I wonder whether he will say that to his own people if they tell him that his decision is not one of the majority of French people. I am sure that is the path this government has to explore. I am sure it is the path the whole world has to explore. The secret is not in strong arm, hairy chested tactics; it is in convincing the French people that they must tell their own government that they will not tolerate the actions of their President.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say at the outset that I support very strongly the motion that has been moved by the government and the amendment that has been moved by the coalition. I believe it would do the whole chamber well not only if the coalition recognised that it supported the government's motion but also if the government recognised that it supported the coalition's amendment and actually did something positive about the issue we are debating today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Australians have found it very disappointing that at a time when the world has finally realised the absurdity, the immorality and the dangers of nuclear testing France has decided that it is going to have one more round of underground testing&mdash;I believe this series of eight tests will conclude in May next year&mdash;before it will put its signature on the comprehensive test ban. If the French reflected on this, they would realise that this may give authority or licence to another country that may not necessarily be their friend, such as China or perhaps in the future Libya, to come forward and accelerate their nuclear arms race. That is the great danger of what France is doing. I believe the French proposal should be opposed on those grounds alone. What the French intend to do is an act of the utmost seriousness and it has quite rightly attracted the moral outrage of much of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe the French have good and valid reasons for this final round of underground nuclear testing. I appreciate that, unlike Australia, France was overrun and invaded in recent times, such as in World War I and World War II. As a result of that, the French have a deep nuclear culture behind them. But today they are not threatened by any country that I am aware of. In fact, they are situated in one of the most stable military regions of the world. They are a member of NATO, as are the United States and Great Britain, which have a nuclear capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I believe there has been a gross overreaction in Australia to some aspects of what has happened. Many people have worked themselves into a lather that to a large extent is unnecessary. The recent torching and burning down of the French consulate in Perth is absolutely deplorable. I understand it has been condemned by everybody in this chamber, and quite rightly so. In fact, the pollutants that would have gone out from burning that building would have done far more damage to Perth than any supposed fallout from the Mururoa underground nuclear tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other extravagant statements have also been made. I note one made the other day by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) when she said that there is good reason to be worried about health as a result of these tests. I do not know of any evidence whatsoever which supports that claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to speak about what these tests involve. They are to be carried out in the Mururoa Atoll, which is way out in the Pacific. It is not in any sense close to Australia. In fact, it is 6,900 kilometres from Australia. So it is certainly not in our backyard in that sense. It is a little closer to Chile, being 6,720 kilometres from its capital, Santiago. It is 6,560 kilometres from Los Angeles in the United States of America where these proposed tests have been given virtually no publicity at all. It is even 4,750 kilometres from New Zealand. This does not mean that it is right to conduct those tests, but they are a long way away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mururoa Atoll is a volcanic reef set amongst about 130 islands making up French Polynesia. The atoll is a partly submerged and extinct volcano. What we can see is the rim of the volcano. The lagoon in the middle is the water-filled crater and the bottom of the lagoon is the bottom of the volcanic crater. Over the years many underground tests have been held there, usually discharging a force of somewhere between 10- and 100-kiloton bomb equivalence. Hiroshima was about 12-kiloton bomb equivalence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underground tests take in letting off a nuclear explosion about a kilometre under the surface from a hole drilled through coral, dolomite and volcanic basalt. It blasts out of a chamber approximately 100 metres wide,</PARA>
<PARA>depending on the force of the explosion. There is melted rock on the walls and then the shaft itself is finally concreted up. There is virtually no leakage from these underground explosions at all if done properly. I do not think that was totally the case in the past but it is today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table is very interesting. It clearly shows that nuclear tests were begun in 1945. The USA had three atmospheric tests. Most tests in those days were all atmospheric. Soon after, in 1949, the USSR started testing. Later in 1952 the United Kingdom commenced testing. In 1960 France started testing in the Sahara Desert when it had Algeria before independence in 1962. Up to 1963, when the atmospheric test ban was signed, 571 tests in total had been carried out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last underground test was conducted by China in 1993. I do not remember all that much outrage from the other side of the parliament or from this side, in fairness. In total something like 1,449 tests have been carried out in the world. If France continues with what it intends to do, there are only eight more to go. Let us all be thankful for that. Let us hope that if we cannot stop these final eight tests that will be the end of it once and for all. Of course, the atmospheric tests were by far the most damaging. Caesium 137 and strontium 90 in particular are contained in every one of us here today due to previous atmospheric tests that were carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levels are very low. It was said that by the time it blew over Australia the radiation dosage increase that we got was only equivalent to living an extra 100 feet above sea level. When you think that members fly to this parliament from Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth, they are increasing their exposure by about 20 times by doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that gives nobody the right to contaminate us at all, no matter to what extent. About half the extra radiation that we have in our bodies is as a result of what the French did in the Pacific in those days. Some of the radiation also comes from the United States and the USSR tests in the Northern Hemisphere. Some of it also comes from what the United Kingdom did at Maralinga, partly at our request, and from what the Chinese did in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Atmospheric tests carried out by the French at Mururoa Atoll between 1966 and 1974 increased the radiation levels in Australia by 0.1 to 0.2 millisieverts. I remind the House that the natural occurring level of radiation that we receive every year is something like 10 to 20 times that. When wandering past the granite in Parliament House we are exposed to quite a substantial level of radiation. If you own a television set and sit quite close to it you get a level of radiation from that. We have to keep this in perspective. The average level of radiation increase amongst the people of the islands of Tureia and Gambia, which are near Mururoa, was only 0.75 millisieverts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that when tests were done in Australia in 1975 on iodine 131, which goes into milk and ends up in our thyroid and could potentially cause cancer, they were unable to detect levels sufficient to cause an increase in cancer. The conclusion of the studies done in 1975 was that the tests at Mururoa would cause less than one additional cancer or genetic deformity. That was the finding of the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, that does not make those tests right. I think we should be grateful that everybody is uniting today to condemn a continuation of tests even if they are underground. Just because the levels are low is not an excuse to carry on with the tests. It does not make it right. Just as the pressure to ban atmospheric tests was correct the pressure to ban tests underground is correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sooner that message gets through to the French the better. This was started by Charles De Gaulle back in 1960 and was carried on by other presidents, such as Giscard d'Estaing and even the socialist President Mitterrand when he came to power in 1981. President Jacques Chirac will allow this to happen later in 1995 and 1996. I believe that not only Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific islands but also the rest of world, and in particular America, should come forward and voice their displeasure with what has happened. In the long run it will do the French cause no good at all and it will give the Chinese a great excuse to continue with their tests if they so wish. I believe it will bring the antipathy of the rest of the world upon France for what it is doing. </PARA>

I do not want to say too much about the comments of the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who preceded me in this debate, but I want to emphasise that, to a very large extent, his comments attempted to downplay the nature, importance and the danger of these tests.

The motion uses the word `condemns' and it says that we share the resentment of South Pacific countries. It also says that we deplore the decision of France and it expresses the outrage of this House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the propositions suggested in the amendment is that we recall the Australian ambassador. The absurdity of that has already been indicated by other members of the government who have spoken in this debate. Another proposition is that we develop with other South Pacific forum countries `a regional plan of action to embarrass and if possible hinder French nuclear testing.' I do not know who drafted this amendment, but those who have spoken in support of it I do not believe have read it very closely. It is incoherent and childish and the government has chosen to reject it. It is all right for the opposition to make propositions of the kind that it has in that amendment, but it is the responsibility of the government to act responsibly in relation to such matters. The government has acted responsibly by rejecting this amendment out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to emphasise that no-one condones the act of violence that was committed against the French consulate in Perth. What I do want to emphasise is that violence begets violence. The tests that France intends to conduct are unquestionably an act of violence against the Pacific nations&mdash;small and vulnerable nations as they are. For example, 5,000 Pacific islanders live in a radius of about 1,000 kilometres of the atoll where these tests are to be conducted. To suggest that because the atoll is relatively isolated the matter is of little consequence I think is an unfortunate reflection on those people who make that claim. </PARA>

<PARA>Ms Daniele Caraty, an organiser of the French-Australian protest rally in Sydney yesterday, claims that the response of some French firms operating in Australia has been to threaten their employees with the sack if they protested publicly about this proposed increase in French testing in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These tests also unquestionably offend against international morality. They undermine the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, they threaten the negotiations for a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, and they unquestionably pose a threat to the environment. They represent an act of violence against the conscience of the world, and especially against the wellbeing of the people of the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there is an element of racism here too. France has claimed that there is no environmental danger, that there are no dangers associated with these tests. Of course government members have said that, if there are no dangers associated with the tests, why are they not being conducted in the English Channel? Why are they not being conducted on French soil in Europe? France has chosen to conduct these tests in the Pacific where, within a relatively small distance, thousands of Pacific islanders&mdash;non-Europeans&mdash;live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French have claimed, of course, that these tests are safe. They have also claimed that they will be the last tests they will conduct. The people of the Pacific should rejoice, according to the French President and foreign minister, both of whom have made comments to that effect. These tests will also provide, according to French claims, all of the technical information that they require so that they can then do simulated tests in the future. In order to do what? In order to refine more sophisticated weapons of mass destruction? And against whom? Should we be pleased? Should we applaud what France is proposing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am stunned that such an argument should be used to seek to excuse the tests and minimise the significance of those tests and everything that they mean as far as Australia, the Pacific, the Pacific islands and islanders and the world community are concerned. If or when a comprehensive test ban treaty is concluded next year, with or without the signature of France, how could France ever in the future provide credible and moral support to any attempt that might be made to discourage other countries from continuing tests or resuming tests?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just briefly, I would make one more point. In our family records there is a note that was sent by my late mother's brother when serving in France during the First World War. In part, that note reads:</PARA>

He was one of 330,000 Australians who fought in Europe in the First World War. Fortunately, he was not one of the 60,000 Australians who died in Europe in the First World War. The overall casualty rate for those young Australians who died and still lie today in Europe was the highest of all the allied forces: 68.5 per cent of all Australians who enlisted and fought in the First World War were in some way casualties. In fact, in four months, in 1917, in a battle near Ypres, 38,000 Australians died&mdash;38,000 Australians fighting for the defence of France died in four months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have responded to these tests in different ways. But the world generally, with the exception of France, has deplored this decision.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with these comments. The question then might be asked as to whether or not these tests are even necessary within the French program for perfecting and making more sophisticated the technology that they bring to nuclear weapons. The National Union of Scientific Researchers in France said it `condemns without reserve' the decision of France to resume those tests. The Nobel prize-winning physicist, Louis Neel, a member of the French Academy of Sciences, said that the tests were `absolutely unnecessary'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill serves to make various portfolio amendments to social security and associated legislation. Taken together, the amendments amount to a significant further step in moulding a responsive and accountable social security system for the Australian community. The bill introduces a series of initiatives that recognise the importance of further education and training in equipping people currently in the social security system for their future roles in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recipients of jobsearch or newstart allowance may currently continue to be paid that allowance for up to three weeks if they start a course that lasts for longer than six months. This payment is made while their entitlement to Austudy or Abstudy is being assessed. The scheme is to be made simpler for all concerned by continuing the payment for a standard three weeks rather than up to three weeks. The scheme is also to be extended to certain people who start courses that last for less than six months and who, as a result, lose qualification for their allowance. Currently, a person in this situation would lose the allowance if the course is one that is not approved for the purposes of the activity test or an activity agreement. Furthermore, special beneficiaries will now also be able to take advantage of these improved rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes an education entry payment available to recipients of jobsearch, newstart or youth training allowance who start a full-time course that lasts for less than six months. This will apply as long as the course is one that they were required to start under the activity test or an activity agreement. Therefore, these people will join the longer term unemployed customers who already have access to this important payment that can make all the difference with the unavoidable up-front costs involved in starting an educational course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An inconsistency is also being eliminated in the treatment of Austudy and Abstudy for the purposes of whether social security allowance or benefit recipients qualify for bereavement payments on the death of their partners. In the past, bereavement payments have been paid only if the person was a long-term social security recipient&mdash;that is, they have been receiving a relevant social security payment for at least 52 weeks. Periods on Austudy and Abstudy will now count towards that period. This will reduce any disadvantage to people who undertake study during an extended period on social security payments compared to those who do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will exclude as income under the act loans made to Austudy and Abstudy recipients under the student financial supplement scheme. The amendment ensures that a person in this situation will not be excluded from qualification for a health care card on the basis of student financial supplement scheme loan payments being included in their income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two amendments are also being made to the waiting and deferment period provisions for jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowance. There is a current rule that reduces the education leavers waiting period for a person who does some full-time study during the waiting period and reclaims allowance within four weeks of starting the course. To improve the incentives for people to attempt a return to education, this concession will now apply if the person reclaims allowance within 12 months of starting the course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also being clarified that the part of the waiting or deferment period that may be waived if a person undertakes approved vocational training during the period is only that part of the waiting or deferment period that overlaps with the vocational training. In other words, it is not the whole waiting or deferment period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also contains a number of useful enhancements to the social security disability programs. Mobility allowance is generally available to people with disabilities who are engaged in gainful employment, vocational training, voluntary work or jobsearch activities to help them with their special transport costs. Period of grace payments of six weeks worth of mobility allowance are paid to people who cease some of these qualifying activities. This bill provides that all mobility allowance recipients will generally receive these period of grace payments when they stop any kind of qualifying activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further amendment relates to telephone allowance. Telephone allowance will continue to be paid to people who lose their entitlement to disability wage supplement when they return to work, as long as they continue to qualify for fringe benefits. Also, it is being clarified that, to be entitled to an employment entry payment, disability wage supplement recipients must claim the payment within a reasonable time of returning to work in the supported wage system. The time limit will be 28 days. These amendments bring disability wage supplement recipients into line with disability support pensioners whose payments are similar in nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also modifies the meaning of the term `continuing inability to work', which is one of the qualification criteria for disability support pension and disability wage supplement. In response to the unanticipated outcome in the AAT case of Loknar, the amendment puts beyond doubt that the necessary assessment must be whether the person is fit for any work, whether skilled or unskilled, that he or she could do without needing preparatory training. Alternatively, if such training were necessary, it would have to be likely to equip the person to do the job within two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a further amendment affecting disability support pension and disability wage supplement, the qualification provisions will address a trend emanating from several recent SSAT and AAT decisions. The amendment will make sure that the person's continuing inability to work is directly caused by an impairment of 20 per cent or more under the act's impairment tables. Factors that are consequences of the impairment, such as attitude and lack of motivation to work, may not be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has assessed the legal impact of the assets test in the Social Security Act on successful native title claims. In general, a person's native title right or interest would be regarded as akin to a life interest because of the restrictions on saleability of native title land. All life interests, unless created by the person or their partner, are exempt under the assets test. Government policy on this issue is clear; the assets test should not apply. The government wishes to make this policy explicit and this bill does that by exempting as assets under the act any native title rights or interests of a person, or of any community or group of which the person is a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compensation recovery provisions of the act protect the social security system from `double dippers'&mdash;that is, those who might receive social security payments, as well as compensation, for the same period. Several measures contained in this bill build on this comprehensive package of provisions. First, the provisions will clearly apply to superseded payment types. In other words, they will apply&mdash;as was always intended&mdash;to the forerunners of the payment types that are already specified in the current provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, a trend in compensation settlements highlighted by the AAT case of Kilinc needs to be overcome. This trend has meant that the compensation recovery provisions have been avoided by splitting compensation settlements into two or more payments, only one of which&mdash;usually relatively small&mdash;is expressed to represent lost earnings or earning capacity and is therefore caught by the provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the provisions will apply to claimants as well as recipients of certain social security payments. This will free claimants as well as the department of the need to go through a time consuming and often costly qualification assessment exercise when the compensation recovery provisions might well already preclude payment. Lastly, compensation payments will be clearly included in income for the purposes of the disadvantaged persons health scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relaxed residence requirements for refugees were introduced last year. These basically allowed the payment of certain pensions to refugees without their needing to satisfy the usual qualifying residence requirements. This bill refines certain aspects of that legislation. The amendments make sure that a person continues to be regarded as a refugee for social security purposes, and therefore retains the residence concession, even if they cease to be the current holder of a refugee type visa because of certain incidental effects of the immigration visa system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loan fringe benefit provisions apply under the family payment income test and the parental means test for young allowance recipients. How this operates is that, if an employee receives a loan from an employer, the employee has a loan fringe benefit. The value of the loan fringe benefit is calculated having regard to a notional interest rate that should reflect market rates. However, it is in fact well below those rates at present. This amendment both raises the rate to a reasonable market rate and sets in place an automatic mechanism for its adjustment each year. The rate will be the lowest available rate from any one of four major banks specified by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provisions also being amended are those that govern the date of effect of determinations to cancel, suspend, increase or decrease a person's jobsearch, newstart or partner allowance. The amendments provide that where the information that results in the determination to vary, cancel or suspend the allowance is provided on a recipient statement notice, the determination will take effect on the day of the event or change. A recipient statement notice is the form that persons receiving these payments are required to submit to the department regularly declaring their circumstances. Lastly, the bill makes minor technical and consequential amendments, including to provisions in the areas of the qualifying age for the seniors health card, the income test and related matters, superannuation pensions, debt recovery and data matching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to add that the government intends to move some minor amendments to the bill at the conclusion of this debate. The amendments relate to three areas in the bill. First, the refugees residence exemption initiative will be amended to make sure that the definition of `qualifying residence exemption' works properly for youth training allowance and parenting allowance as intended. Also, a reference to a particular qualifying visa class is to be refined. Secondly, there will be minor technical amendments to the compensation recovery measures to remove superfluous provisions and preserve the effect of another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there will be two minor amendments to the qualification provisions for partner allowance to ensure consistency with the amendments introduced in the Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1991. Earlier today these amendments, which the government proposes to move at the consideration in detail stage, were circulated. I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum in connection with these amendments. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess there are 10 minutes in which to deal with a bill that really requires a good deal more attention than we will be able to give it tonight. I do want to make a number of points about the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 because, as the government would know, we give a great deal of attention to considering the proposals that the government brings forward to deal with social security matters. There is a good deal of interest, quite surprisingly, in some of these matters that seem at times to be described as more technical. Let me just foreshadow that the opposition has some difficulty with three issues amongst the very large number of issues that have been raised in the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go through and detail each of the matters that we agree with. I ought to check the last letter I had from the government's advisers in relation to the amendments that were circulated today. Certainly, my file and my own recollection indicate that I was not acquainted with the terms of the amendments that the government intends to propose to this bill. I do not believe I have seen either the explanatory memorandum or the further amendments. I accept the parliamentary secretary at her word that they are minor, inconsequential amendments designed to improve the legislation, but I would like to turn my mind to them before I give you any assurance as to the passage that will be accorded them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, let me just identify the three issues of concern. They relate first to the clarification of the qualification requirements for the disability support pension, the disability wage supplement; secondly, the issue of the native rights and interests that are not to be taken into account when applying the assets test in the act; and, finally, the issue of the split compensation settlements. They are the three issues that we will be addressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the first issue, I have had an extraordinarily large number of representations from principally the Welfare Rights Centre in Sydney which has put down in detail its comments on this particular matter, but I have been apprised of a concern from every major organisation that is involved in offering advice on welfare issues. The Sussex Street Community Law Service was one such organisation. I have had representations from the Townsville Community Rights Legal Service Inc., the National Federation of Blind Citizens of Australia Ltd, the Welfare Rights Centre here in the Australian Capital Territory&mdash;Mr Stephen Langman, the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association of New South Wales, the South Australian Council of Social Services Inc., the Welfare Rights Centre of South Australia Inc., as well as the Launceston Community Legal Service Inc. The fact is that when you receive representations from such a wide representative group of bodies that do comment on these matters you have to be aware that there are potential difficulties with the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, I have had a large number of letters from individuals who are concerned at the purport of these particular clauses. Our intention in relation to that matter and the three other matters that I adverted to is to have a further opportunity in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs to hear each of those interested parties on that matter and to hear the department's justification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it very clear, and I do not do so lightly, that the issue of attitude and lack of motivation which has been raised by those bodies and the extent to which it ought to be related to a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment of 20 per cent or more strikes a positive chord with us, but we are open to be persuaded that the view that the government has adopted on this matter is incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the issue of native title being excluded from the provisions of the assets test, if, as has been suggested by the parliamentary secretary in her address, it is clear that in all like situations&mdash;and life estates was one that was mentioned&mdash;that has been and is the practice, that because you cannot access a particular asset the appropriate response is that an exclusion from the assets test applications is appropriate, obviously we would be prepared to look at that question in a positive light. But it needs to be seen that the provisions that are being enacted here are in every respect provisions that you would have in a system of social security that is available to all Australians who have satisfied the broad ranging eligibility criteria. In other words, there should not be provisions that give, on the basis of a person's culture or race, a particular advantage that, in principle, you would not accord to people in like circumstances. That ought to be the principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had some advice from the parliamentary secretary's advisers which came to me after we in the opposition had given consideration to the treatment of this particular matter. A number of questions that I had in mind have been answered, but I think it is important that the answers to these questions go on the record. I did ask whether the exclusion of native title rights and interests from the assets test also apply to land obtained under the land acquisition fund. I think it is important that members know that the advice that has been furnished is that under the proposed amendments this is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, I asked whether the exclusion of native title rights and interests from the assets test also apply to land obtained under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The advice I received on that matter, belatedly, was that under the proposed amendments it would not be the case. In order to look at the issue of consistency in application, I also asked what was meant by the inclusion of `relating to rights and interests under the law of a foreign country dealing with native title issues'. It was quite interesting what advice came forward in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department was originally alerted to the possible significance of native title rights and interests to assets by a customer who had a native title interest in New Zealand under the Treaty of Waitangi. Subsequent inquiries revealed that native title rights were recognised in Canada where Indians, Inuits and Metis have such rights and that the United States and Sweden were currently considering introducing native title regimes. You can see that it had fairly wide application. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I would like this evening to express my encouragement of the Australian National University internship program which you have nurtured in this parliament. I took advantage of this program for the first time in the last intake in March. I expressed an interest in having my intern investigate the use of hemp as a resource. I have been singularly fortunate in acquiring the services of Mica Stark from the University of New Hampshire. Mica has done an outstanding paper which I shall at a later date be presenting to the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts in my capacity as deputy chair of that committee. I would like to make a few points about Mica's paper which he has prepared for me to present to you this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that most people do not know the difference between hemp and marijuana. Although they both come from the same plant, Cannabis sativa, they have drastically different THC levels. THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the chemical component in marijuana that produces a hallucinogenic effect. THC levels in marijuana are between two and 10 per cent, whereas THC levels in hemp such as the hemp used to make the paper for Mica's report, which I have here with me this evening, are below 0.3 per cent&mdash;so minimal that you would need to smoke hectare upon hectare to get any hallucinogenic effect. Because many people do not know the difference between hemp and marijuana, there is a belief in society that state governments are now looking at growing marijuana, when they are simply looking at growing hemp for industrial purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hemp has been grown for paper, sails, rugs, art canvas, clothes, oil, paint, varnishes and many other goods for thousands of years. Until the 1880s, hemp was the world's largest agricultural crop and the world's most traded good. Hemp was used so universally because of its inherent strength. Mr Speaker, as you can see from the fibres which I demonstrate to you this evening, hemp has particularly long fibres&mdash;in fact, the world's longest agricultural fibres. They are very good indeed. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6V5">Mr CAMERON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They would grow very well in Queensland and probably even better in Western Australia. It is because the hemp's fibres are long that they are so strong, thus making it an excellent source of fibre for manufacturing goods. In recent years throughout the world, interest in hemp has increased. This is due in large part to the strain and pressure we are placing on our forests. Although there are people who will refute this claim, there is an unfortunate reality glaring us in the face, and that is that our forests are under tremendous strain to provide for our paper and timber needs. With consumption of paper in Australia expected to increase by four per cent this year alone, it is time we began to look at hemp as an alternative resource for the manufacturing of paper, fabric and fuel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the last few years, and in particular this year, state governments have begun to explore the possibility of industrial hemp crops. It is time the federal government also began to look at it. It is my belief that Mica's report will kick-start the debate on this issue. His report addresses several different areas which I hope my committee will investigate in more depth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most fascinating parts of the report is the section that deals with the environmental benefits of growing hemp. This is one of the reasons why we should take a serious look at it. Research that has been done overseas has proven that hemp can be grown without herbicides and pesticides. Hemp also suppresses weeds and soil-borne diseases. With these characteristics, hemp is a farmer's delight. It has obvious environmental and economic advantages. One environmental benefit from growing hemp is its ability to consume carbon dioxide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economically, hemp could prove to be a goldmine. Based on the markets that have been established overseas, there is a huge demand for hemp products. For example, there is a woman in France who is building houses out of a material called Isochanvre, which is made by mixing the inner portion of the hemp stem and natural lime. Perhaps my colleague the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) can show members the inner portion of the stem. The woman in France builds several hundred houses a year and has a waiting list of thousands who want their houses built out of Isochanvre. In England there is a hemp paper company that is unable to meet the demand for its paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hemp is a win-win situation. It has both environmental and economic effects. The first Western country to develop a major hemp industry will have struck a goldmine. It is important for Australia to begin developing its own hemp industry, and it is time to address those issues now. I welcome all comments on this topic. There are many issues which still need to be addressed and researched and it is time to address those issues now. To help get the hemp industry off the ground, the government could help by amending existing drug laws to allow for the industrial cultivation of any hemp cultivar which contains less than 0.3 per cent THC. We can also begin educating people on the difference between hemp and marijuana. I seek leave to table Mica Stark's report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 August last year in the House, I raised the issue of the impact of increasing road traffic on our quality of life. I am privileged to represent an area which is on the doorstep of a major city, yet retains its leafy streets, peaceful parks and quiet suburbs. It is a place where many pensioners and seniors have retired, an area where young families have chosen to raise their children within close proximity to the city, to send their children to school and to enjoy the tranquillity of life. This is a close and supportive community. Communities such as these are a very important part of our city and our state. Successful communities like these around Wavell Heights, Chermside, Kalinga, Kedron, Wooloowin and Nundah are the most important resource any government can have, because successful communities are the basis of a successful society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 12 months there has been a public debate about traffic congestion throughout these suburbs. Traffic affects our health, our safety and our work. The sickening screeching of tyres and the all too frequent sound of sirens signalling traffic accidents jolt our sense of security and wellbeing. Nothing can be more important than the quality of the air we breathe, affected as it is by vehicle emissions. In Brisbane we have one of the highest incidences of asthma in Australia, with over 10 per cent of the population suffering. In many of these suburbs the incidence is much higher than that, affecting one in four children in many of our local suburbs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motorcar is a necessary evil. It is essential for many of us in earning our living, and socially it gives us great mobility to enhance the quality of our life through recreation. As a community we have to find the balance between our use of the motorcar and the enhancement of our quality of life. Communities must control the car. We cannot let the car drive all of our social and economic decisions. Whilst traffic is necessary, we must control its effect upon our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area I represent is at the apex of growth pressures in south-east Queensland. Pressures in south-east Queensland are stretching our local quality of life through noise from the airport and the growing number of cars on quiet suburban roads. Since last November there has been a state government commissioned traffic study in the suburbs I mentioned earlier. The study was commissioned after the state government ruled out a proposed airport tollway through the suburbs of Kalinga and Wooloowin. Working with the local community, I played an active role in opposing the tollway and asking the state government to set up a genuine consultative process to involve local communities in planning their community and transportation needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with Terry Sullivan, the MLA for Chermside, and the airport motorway action committee, the airport motorway was opposed and it was successfully stopped. The independent study conducted by Mitchell McCotter and Ove Arup was commissioned by the state government. The consultants are due to present their final report to the state government soon. The report contains options&mdash;only options&mdash;for government decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late in November 1994, I met with the consultants to express my concern about the methodology of their consultation and the quality of the early consultative meetings with the community. I did this because I was extremely concerned about the quality of feedback I received from local residents. Because I live in and know this community well, I pointed out to the consultants that in the northern part of the study area, Kedron and Wavell Heights, they must directly engage locals in the consultation process by advertising in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northside Chronicle</EMPHASIS>. I also pointed out to them that they should communicate directly with residents via Australia Post.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representatives of the airport motorway action committee were present at these meetings and can confirm these discussions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, neither of these recommendations was taken up by the consultants. In their third community consultation newsletter issued in March 1995, where they canvassed road based options for the northern suburbs, out of the blue an option to upgrade Rode Road to four lanes was included. To my knowledge, such an option has never been discussed before at any level of government or at any significant level of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the other options outlined in the road options put forward by the consultants had previously been the result of extensive consultation, discussion and criticism amongst locals. To have included this option at this stage without local community consultation was an act of incompetence and a blunder on the part of the consultants. This blunder has unnecessarily alarmed residents in the Rode Road area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Saturday the local community gathered to express their concern at the inclusion of this option in newsletter No. 3. I share their anger because this option has never been, and could never be, considered. It has not been, and has never been, a serious option. This is also the view of the local member of parliament, Mr Terry Sullivan. The state government should immediately rule out this option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traffic congestion is a complex problem. As we head towards the 21st century, it requires a comprehensive road transport policy which upgrades our approach to public transport. Governments need to provide better public transport and citizens need to vote with their feet and support public transport. A one-dimensional approach of simply building more roads is unacceptable. The futility of this approach can be seen in Los Angeles. To use a medical analogy, you cannot keep widening arteries forever without cutting into vital tissue. Cut too deep and you risk harming essential organs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To maintain and enhance our quality of life in Brisbane, we must have a comprehensive urban transport policy, which in this local area also means better buses and rail transport, including a railway link to the airport.

Where I come from in the northern suburbs of Sydney, the one topic on everyone's mind is Super League and the damage that it is doing to the great game of rugby league. It is a tragedy that some of the game's finest players were not able to participate in this year's State of Origin. It is a tragedy that some lifelong friendships, the best friendships, those friendships forged in the cauldron of sport and the comradery of sport, have been put under severe strain and even sundered by what is going on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that there are two big problems with what is happening at the moment. First, it is all very well to pay a tiny, elite group of players enormous amounts of money to be gladiators, but what is going to happen to the junior game, the nursery of the game, and what is going to happen to the community clubs, which are part of the game's great mystique? Secondly, it is all very well one man owning an individual and it is all very well one man owning a club, but for one man to own not only the individuals and the clubs but the whole sport lock, stock and barrel is simply outrageous. </PARA>

Talking about the Super League, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The administration of the game should involve much more than maximising profits for either Rupert Murdoch or Kerry Packer. The interests of rugby league supporters and the code's junior players should not be sacrificed for the sake of corporate dollars.</PARA>
<PARA>I say, `Hear, hear!' to the member for Werriwa. I think he has hit the nail on the head. If what was happening here was a businessman trying to corner all the outlets in an important market, at the very least it would be referred to the Trade Practices Commission for investigation. </PARA>

Nevertheless, one old wrong never justifies a new one. I want to say to this parliament that rugby league is a people's game, not a magnate's game.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to talk about declaring bankruptcy in drug administration. Society has progressed a long way from the Ten Commandments, a long way from the simple basic laws of `Thou shalt not kill' and `Thou shalt not steal'. Any visitor to a law library is witness to a massive display of man's ingenuity in refining and inventing social solutions and social ills. The drug industry, which consumes whole national economies, fills the world's streets with crime and its gaols with inmates and corrupts police forces and officials ruthlessly, is a social and economic cost that is unmeasurable and can no longer be ignored by society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ten Commandments are silent concerning substances that alter moods. The prophets were wise enough to understand the limits of law. Attempts through history to interfere in nature have always led to disaster. This century's other example of such a social experiment was the prohibition era in the United States. This experiment created a huge and bloody social cost and, like drugs today, a criminal underworld that made its own laws until the whole concept of prohibition was bankrupted and banished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current state of affairs in our society caused by the drug industry brought about by a social problem and its maladministration must lead to a fresh and brave look at this whole philosophy. While substances exist, they will be used. While substances remain uncontrolled and beyond the pale of regulation, they will create crime, maintain a criminal underworld, promote misery and extract immeasurable social costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If drugs were legalised, regulated, taxed and controlled, there is a strong case that it would produce a better society, empty the gaols, free police from corruption and create substantial tax revenue. The combined revenue and deficit reductions are likely to produce an increase of $1 billion to the Australian exchequer&mdash;and many people say substantially more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A scenario can easily be created whereby marijuana and its derivatives are available over the counter in bars or special shops, controlled and taxed appropriately, and cocaine and heroin are available from hospitals and clinics to those who are addicted, and in a manner that lends itself to proper treatment. Relatively harmless mood changing substances such as alcohol and marijuana need regulation. Addictive substances need treatment or maintenance. Penal institutions should be for crime; they should not be garbage bins of mismanaged social problems at immense cost to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a fresh set of laws and regulations would immediately halt the pushers and their corrupt industry. The diminished margins would immediately render the trade uninteresting. By treating cocaine and heroin as treatable and available, it cuts the underworld and the corrupt police from this enormous uncontrolled international industry. The huge margins the underworld lives off disappear and so does the social glamour inherent in illegal use. Availability in hospitals puts a different and less glamorous aspect to the social use of addictive drugs. </PARA>

By any measure, they are a set of laws and consequent practices that are a huge net cost to society in both money and misery. Society deserves and needs better than this sordid and miserable result. To think the unthinkable is often a prelude to thinking commonsense. I say to members of this House that the problem is so obvious and so widespread in Australia today that we have to apply commonsense to it before it consumes us all. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now reached the stage in Far North Queensland where the Rainbow Harbour project in Cairns is held up, some might argue, indefinitely; the Palm Cove project in Cairns is held up, some might argue, indefinitely; and the East Trinity Inlet project in Cairns is held up, some might argue, indefinitely. So too have Clump Point at Mission Beach; the Mission Park project at Mission Beach; the Kirrima project out the back of Cardwell; the Port Hinchinbrook project, which has been the subject of national media attention; the Dungeness project at Ingham; and the Secret Harbour project at Ingham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are informed by the chamber of commerce that the number of jobs involved in the first three projects in Cairns ranges between 1,500 and 2,000. The Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) is on the record on a number of occasions as saying we desperately need to provide infrastructure for our expanding tourism industry. This is true. The industry is expanding by about 20 per cent a year and has been doing so now for some considerable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no reason to believe that the industry will not continue to expand by 20 per cent a year. But I am not aware of a solitary infrastructure item being built in the whole of Queensland at present. So the 20 per cent increase will not be able to be accommodated. The Hon. Michael Lee is dead right in his statements that something must be done to ensure that we will have these facilities. Here we have people quite happy to risk literally thousands of millions of dollars between Ingham and Cairns in Far North Queensland and they are being stopped at every twist and turn. We are in a situation where not a single project has been allowed to go ahead. The cost is some 1,500 jobs in Cairns, 250 at Clump Point, 30 at Mission Park, 70 at Kirrima, 1,100 at Port Hinchinbrook, 40 at Dungeness and 70 at Secret Harbour&mdash;a grand total of 3,000 jobs that should exist at present but do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am concentrating today upon the tourism industry, I cannot help but mention the Tully-Millstream, where a thousand jobs are involved in the construction phase, and the prawn and fish farming industries, where projects with 200 jobs are involved. Again, as with the tourism industry, I am not aware of a solitary project which has been allowed to go ahead at present. We are at a dead stop. This is an industry which in every other country is injecting thousands of millions of dollars into their economy, yet in Australia we are talking possibly about $30 million. Japan or Taiwan can look at maybe $2,000 million or $3,000 million a year coming in from this industry yet we, who are far more suitably attuned to being able to provide this industry, do not have a single project being allowed to go ahead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the adjournment debate I rise to speak on the French nuclear tests in the Pacific. I do so because I did not get the opportunity to speak on the questions put before the House previously. Firstly, I have had a 25-year involvement in this issue. Whilst flicking through the minutes of a meeting at a dinner last year which was the 20-year reunion of people who were Young Labor members in New South Wales I noticed a Mr Bob Carr seconded a motion calling for action to be taken against the French for their activities in nuclear testing on Mururoa Atoll. I was the person who moved that motion, which was subsequently carried.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, coming from the same district as I, you would be aware of my involvement over the last 20 years in protest marches and in the organisation of ideas about the proliferation of nuclear weapons and also about the nuclear industry. You would also remember a study of the nuclear medicine facilities at Wollongong hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I became involved in the Australian nuclear-free zone secretariat as a delegate from Kiama, my municipality. I was ultimately elected to the position of deputy convenor of the Australian nuclear-free zone secretariat, a position I held with honour. In that capacity I rode from Sydney to Melbourne on a bike to publicise the movement of nuclear material along the Hume Highway without any notification having been given to the municipalities or the emergency services along that highway or any regard having been paid to the safety procedures which should have been in place. As a result, the Victorian local government association and the New South Wales local government association adopted a resolution which I had passed through Kiama council. These were not extremely radical organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was arrested in Redbank, Queensland in 1989 at an Australian nuclear-free zone secretariat function. Perhaps some of the National Party members would recall what their National Party government in Queensland was going to do. Two hundred and fifty metres from the Brisbane river, over the oldest coal mines that are unsurveyed in Australia, 400 metres from a malt brewery that supplies the whole of Australia, 600 metres from Redbank and a kilometre and a half from the outer suburbs of Brisbane, it wanted to put a radioactive dump. I have been through all these arguments and I have been in the front line. I was arrested and found guilty, but no charges were laid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have advocated that while we have demilitarisation we should look at the problems that that creates. In the past, when the Soviet Union had all its missile capacity and nuclear potential, millions of dollars were invested in the protection of that military capacity and that nuclear material. Since the end of the Cold War no such funds or energy have been put into protecting our environment from that radioactive material&mdash;plutonium, et cetera. I have been advocating that for some time. After what has happened in the House today, I see that the coalition will be supporting me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask that members of the coalition, after what they said today in this House, join with me on the safeguards that I want to put on the nuclear industry here in Australia. That includes X-ray sensing of metals&mdash;you, Mr Speaker, and I are very well aware of this, having the steelworks and BHP in our area&mdash;the safeguards that need to be applied to nuclear medicine and the safeguards that need to be applied to all the applications that are now taking place with nuclear material in this country. I hope that those opposite will join me on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 25 years I have been involved in this debate and I have not seen one member of the coalition at any meeting and I have not seen any of their names on any letterhead. Where have they been? For them to find their so-called conscience now when public opinion is rife is hypocritical. I find it very difficult to believe. I put this to the coalition: will any members who have signed any letters on this issue over the last 25 years please give me copies, so that I can take back my remarks and not tar you all with the same brush of irresponsible, hypocritical, political activity over this issue. But you will not get any consolation from the people of Australia, because they know where you have been for the last 25 years. You have not been in this debate in any way, shape or form. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) and (3) In the CPI the major costs of home ownership are represented by mortgage interest payments. The ABS conducts reviews of the CPI about every five years. The ABS gave extensive consideration to the issues raised, in both the 11th and 12th series reviews. During the 11th series review in late 1986 and following extensive consultation with a broad range of users, the ABS rejected using imputed rents as a measure of the costs incurred by home ownership. Mortgage interest charges were introduced for this component in the March quarter 1987. This decision to reject the use of imputed rents was widely re-endorsed by users and the CPI Technical Consultative Committee during the next (12th series) review in 1992. The use of an imputed rental measure was rejected largely because it is not consistent with the outlays approach used to construct the Australian CPI.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Individual OECD nations' treatment of the housing cost component varies widely. Based upon available information, treatment of home ownership costs can be summarised as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining countries include some kind of direct measure of owner occupier housing costs.

All of these countries include mortgage interest charges in their CPIs, but their approaches differ in other aspects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Differences between countries reflect the different uses to which the CPI is put, the operation of housing markets, the size of the private rented housing sector and the availability and reliability of data.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The relocation of the Army Maritime School (AMS) is an integral part of the proposal to relocate 10 Terminal Regiment from Sydney and, therefore, an exact cost for AMS alone cannot be specified. The AMS and 10 Terminal Regiment will occupy common facilities at the new location in Townsville. Some of these facilities would have been required whether or not AMS was included in the proposal. An estimate for AMS has been calculated on a pro-rata basis of ARA personnel strength. AMS comprises 30 personnel and 10 Terminal Regiment comprises 150 personnel. The estimated costs associated with the relocation of the AMS and the School of Artillery are shown in the following table.</PARA>
