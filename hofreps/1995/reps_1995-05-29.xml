<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House expresses its extreme concern at the failure, after twelve years, of the federal Government to provide a world competitive transport system for the nation, in particular, (a) heavily overtaxing fuel notwithstanding the enormous distances freight has to travel, (b) failure to achieve uniform national regulations for road transport, (c) underinvesting in transport infrastructure, (d) failure to provide fair retail pricing for fuel in country regions, (e) failure to develop a competitive national rail freight service despite promises to do so five years ago and (f) despite expenditure of $430 million our performance on the waterfront continues to fall further behind our competitors and that as a consequence regional development has been stifled while exports have been denied the chance to reach their full potential.</PARA>
<PARA>For 12 years we have seen a government that has been big on selling and short on vision. It has been big on rhetoric and short on long-term planning. Transport is one of the main areas of arrogant shortsightedness. Over the 12 years where gains could have been made we have seen nothing but a decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I will examine several key areas in which I believe this government has allowed our transport system to be far less than world competitive. In fact, it has allowed us to fall behind, meaning that every Australian is suffering. I will look at six areas: fuel tax, the lack of uniform regulations, infrastructure investment, country fuel prices, rail freight and the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I start with fuel tax. We see that tax on fuel has been marked by nothing but adhockery and a constant increase. The government has continued to extract more and more tax from fuel users while spending less and less on roads. In fact, when Labor came to power in 1983, over 60 per cent of fuel tax was spent on roads. Today, less than 10 per cent of fuel tax is used by the Commonwealth for road funding. Looking at what has happened in real terms is even more startling. Using 1992-93 prices, we find that back in 1982-83 road funding was over $1,400 million whereas today it is $795 million. That is almost half the figure of 12 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1990, when we had all those election promises and One Nation programs, road funding has dropped by a staggering two-thirds. By maintaining very high costs of fuel, the transport costs for all production rise. There is an indirect price flow-on to consumer goods, which hits all Australians&mdash;not just at the petrol bowser but also at the shops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area I look at is that of regulation. This is a very sorry tale. In 1983 there was an inquiry. In 1984 we had a report. The government said that that report would be put in place by 1988. Of course, that didn't happen. In 1991 we had another promise that it would all be in place by 1995. Now the government is going to have to defer again. Why? It is not because it can blame the states, but because the federal government itself still has not got its own legislation in place, despite all these years&mdash;12 years later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the performance of the National Road Transport Commission, which started off very well and produced some excellent reports, we find that, as usual, the government has failed to act and it is now seen as little more than an area for a lot of talk. When we look at this whole question of road reform, we see the priority that the government gives it, because it is not even the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) who is taking responsibility nowadays, it is a parliamentary secretary. The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) is a nice chap but he does not have a lot of clout. He is only a parliamentary secretary. Of course, what has really happened is that we are seeing the monkey being sent in to do the job instead of the organ grinder&mdash;the organ grinder being none other than Dangerman, who is obviously too busy spending too much time screwing up industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One little example illustrates it perfectly. Eight months ago, when the drought got too much for one Queensland cattle producer, he went to arrange for a livestock transporter to take the cattle interstate. The transporter found that he met all the regulations in Queensland. He checked it out with New South Wales and the answer came back by fax that it was okay. He checked out Western Australia and the answer came back by fax that it was okay. South Australia said, `No, you'd have to bring your truck down here and we'll have to inspect it before you can do it.' Not surprisingly, he decided that he would take the risk. He got caught at Ceduna. He had to take the truck back to Port Augusta to have a quick inspection, pick up a fine and go on with his job. What better illustration do we have as to how much this government has failed in its move to get uniform regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole performance means that we have a government of perpetual announcement. We get announcement after announcement, inquiry after inquiry, always with a long time frame for these announcements, but somehow the government never delivers. When we look at the area of infrastructure, as with many other areas, the government has tried to spotlight all of this. If we look at it in real terms, there has been a long-term decline in public investment as a proportion of GDP. I am sure the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) would back that up. I think it can all be summed up by what the Institution of Engineers said in 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Present level of infrastructure spending is grossly inadequate. Creation of the existing framework has required consistent national investment years of twice the present rate. Failure to make adequate provision for maintenance and repair of that framework, let alone for continuing development and expansion to meet new opportunities. Over a short period of time, this will reduce our international competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is&mdash;it puts it very simply in black and white. Yet the government continues to ignore this. What we are really seeing is just a flow of reports. For example, there was the Task Force on Regional Development in 1993. There was the Allen Consulting Group's report to the Automobile Association in 1993 which pointed to massive unfunded road and rail projects of the order of $15 billion to $20 billion and pointed out that the traffic congestion costs of Sydney and Melbourne are $2 billion each year. There was the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics analysis in 1994 which backed this up. And so the reports go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the level of funding. What we find is that where there is funding there is massive waste. What better summation of this than the speech by the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) when he delivered the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure report in 1993 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall there is little doubt that the existing inefficiencies in road construction and maintenance activities across all levels of government are robbing this nation of up to almost $1 billion worth of roadworks each year.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, almost $1 billion worth of additional roadworks could be performed in this country without the expenditure of one additional dollar.</PARA>
<PARA>What an indictment, and it came from a member of the government, a former Minister for Transport, someone who really understands it. This was nearly 11 years after the government came to power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at country fuel prices, we see clearly that the Labor Party has very little understanding of country areas and, worse still, cares less. The cost of transport, of course, is vital to people in the country because they rely on it every day. As a percentage of total costs for people in the country, transport is always much higher; in fact, often double. The Business Council of Australia put out a report in 1994 which stated that road transport in rural areas was overpriced. It said that road transport in city areas was underpriced. That is very interesting. I think the point is made very clearly once again that Labor ensures that the country subsidises the city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report went on to suggest that rural fuel prices should be 20c per litre lower than now. This would lower costs to people in the country by a staggering $2.1 billion and would obviously have a far greater impact on our rural export competitiveness. High prices not only affect exports but also distort rural-urban investment patterns. These figures make a mockery of the government's regional development policy which is talking about $140 million over four years. The government talks of level playing fields. Maybe it ought to remember that charity begins at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to get on to rail freight but, unfortunately, time is going to be a bit limited. The Industry Commission has made many reports. We know that, because we do not have a world best practice rail system, the costs to farmers and the costs to our mining industry are far higher. The Bureau of Industry Economics has made points about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The waterfront is another area where $430 million has been spent, yet we are going backwards. As Contship put in its most recent rating of 46 ports, Sydney has dropped from 24th to 31st and Melbourne has dropped from 28th to 37th. What has happened on the waterfront really is a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this shows that the Labor Party is not serious about reform. In fact, it has failed. Transport is one of the most essential things in this country, yet the government has neglected it and has failed to provide decent leadership for this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the chance to debate this motion and the further opportunity it provides to examine the transport policies of the opposition. The motion and the speech by the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) are based on two propositions, two assumptions: first, that the coalition in government would increase federal expenditure on transport; and, second, that it would lower taxes on fuel. Nothing could be further from the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing could be further from the truth once one examines the sorts of fiscal policies that are being promoted, for instance, by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). The approach of those in the coalition is typical. They are the two-card tricksters of Australian politics because they only show one card at a time, never the two together. For instance, the shadow Treasurer in his budget reply speech at the National Press Club on 17 May showed one card. He declared the coalition's support for the FitzGerald report objective of increasing national savings in Australia by five per cent of GDP. The other card he tried to show that day was the pretension of inoffensive policies: no new taxes, no tax increases and no use of those particular budgetary tools to increase national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the press club he also pointed out that privatisation does nothing to improve national savings in Australia. He argued that the privatisation of Telecom, one of the opposition's policies, would do nothing to meet that objective of improved national savings. This is what the shadow Treasurer said at the press club:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Asset sales do nothing to boost national savings. They are simply a transfer of ownership from the public to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA>Under these circumstances, the House is entitled to ask: where is the coalition going to find the five per cent lift, the five per cent improvement, in national savings? If it is not coming from new taxes, if it is not going to come from tax increases and if it cannot come from privatisation of assets like Telecom, it leaves a $20 billion hole in the outlays policies of the coalition, because that is the equivalent of five per cent of GDP. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow minister at the table can laugh about it, but the truth is that, until the coalition specifies its fiscal policies, it has a gaping $20 billion hole in its aspirations to improve national savings. There will be no new money for transport under a coalition government and no lower taxes on fuel. To increase the outlays on transport or to lower the taxes on fuel would make the fiscal hole in the coalition policies even larger.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I must pay tribute to the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) for his honesty, because he is one of the very few coalition members who is willing to show both cards in the two-card trick to the Australian public at the same time. He did that in an interview with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, also published on 17 May. Let me read the report for the benefit of National Party members who will be going back to their electorates after this debate, along with the member for Wannon, saying that they are committed to improved transport outlays, particularly in roads. Let me read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the details of that report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party, Mr Tim Fischer, broke a central tenet of rural political philosophy yesterday by saying a Coalition government would be unlikely to increase spending on roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fischer told the annual conference of the National Farmers Federation that any increase could hurt rural Australia by increasing government borrowings and pushing up interest rates. He said it would be irresponsible to promise any increases in normal road spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amounts to a reduction in road expenditure proposed at the last federal election.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is&mdash;the bald-faced rather honest admission from the Leader of the National Party that there will be no increase in road expenditure under a coalition government, particularly in rural areas. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Truss" NAMEID="GT4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr Truss</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has been contradicted by his frontbench colleague, the honourable member for Wide Bay, who was saying that his leader is wrong. An interesting division has emerged in the coalition for a frontbencher to be saying in parliament that the Leader of the National Party is wrong. The honourable member for Wide Bay apparently is promising to rural Australia an increased expenditure in roads. I think the more honest assessment and more honest showing of the two cards to the Australian public came from the Leader of the National Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the government's record on transport, there is absolutely no two card trickery. This government is full on aces. When we examine the record of tax in fuel, the tax take now in 1995-96 is lower than it was in 1982-83. If the honourable member for Wannon has a complaint about the scale of tax revenue taken by the federal government from fuel, he should be talking to his predecessor, Malcolm Fraser. It was Malcolm Fraser who turned the petrol bowsers of this nation into a tax revenue source. Since 1982-83 government receipts from fuel taxes, minus the diesel rebate, have declined in real terms from $6.4 billion, where they were left by the previous member for Wannon, Malcolm Fraser, in 1982-83, to $5 billion forecast in the 1995-96 budget. Members of the National Party should take their shoes off and get their hands on the table and do their sums. They will find that, once they look at the fuel taxes minus the diesel rebate in Australia, the sum total has declined over the last 12 years and that represents real relief for rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the National Road Transport Commission has calculated that the tax share of vehicle operating costs in Australia is approximately six per cent&mdash;there is an effective tax share of six per cent. It is little different to the average tax rate paid by all industries. Here we have competitive neutrality. It is beautiful to see. There is a six per cent effective tax share on vehicle operating costs in Australia. It is little different to the way in which federal taxes are applied to other industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the second proposition advanced by the honourable member for Wannon&mdash;uniform national regulations for road transport&mdash;he does not need to speak to Malcolm Fraser about that; he needs to talk to his coalition colleagues in New South Wales. The Fahey government in New South Wales&mdash;the tories&mdash;were holding back the progress on national regulations for road transport. The one recalcitrant state was New South Wales under the Liberal Party and the National Party. There is absolutely no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the third proposition&mdash;this concept of underinvestment in infrastructure&mdash;it has been revealed in this debate that the coalition would do less in transport spending, particularly in rural areas, because of the $20 billion fiscal hole in its policies for the next election and the very honest assessment I have read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record from the Leader of the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, there are two recent reports finding that overall spending on transport is not the central issue; it is the effective targeting of spending that matters most. I refer honourable members opposite to the EPAC report which found that the overall level of transport spending in Australia is satisfactory. It is the effective targeting that is all important. Further, the National Transport Planning Taskforce, in its report in December last year, concluded that there was insufficient evidence&mdash;we certainly have not heard it from the honourable member for Wannon today&mdash;to support a case for a substantial increase in the current level of overall transport infrastructure spending. Therefore, this high quality report has found that the government has pretty well got it right in terms of overall spending on transport infrastructure around the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Transport Planning Taskforce goes on at page 6 of its report&mdash;and I am sure the National Party members opposite have not even bothered to open this report&mdash;to outline the key areas of strategic transport investment which would lift national productivity and GDP. I was delighted to hear the member for Wannon outlining to the House his support for the findings of the FitzGerald study on the allocation of road funding. It found&mdash;and it has been confirmed by the National Transport Planning Taskforce&mdash;that the big efficiency gain, the big improvement in productivity, comes from a transfer in road funding from rural to urban areas, from local to arterial roads. That is understandable because we have moved the economy from an old mining quarry and a reliance on agricultural exports to advanced manufacturing and service industries in urban areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to transfer road funding from rural to urban areas, from local to arterial roads, to boost GDP and productivity. Those opposite should not look confused towards me but towards the member for Wannon. In his address, reported now in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, he totally supported the findings of that FitzGerald study. That is what it said; that is where the big improvements in national efficiency and productivity lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time, unfortunately, will prevent me from outlining this government's outstanding record in the other aspects of transport raised in the motion. But I have full confidence that my colleagues the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the member for Paterson (Mr Horne) will outline this government's fine record on the waterfront and other aspects of transport infrastructure. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know where the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has been these last several years, but obviously he has not been in Australia. He mentioned a lot of reports, but the figures I have, in comparison with his, indicate that the government receives nearly $10 billion in excise and tax from fuel, and this year it is spending a measly $840 million on roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am from a rural area, and it is about time that rural areas stood up and had their say. I heard the member for Werriwa say that the money should be transferred to the city. Does he not know that two out of every three dollars Australia earns in export income is generated in rural areas? What do we get back for it? If you are talking about mining, farming, fishing, tourism or forestry, most of that money comes from rural areas. We earn this money in rural areas, yet the people in the capital cities&mdash;and good luck to them too&mdash;have the advantage of cheaper fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give you an example, and this is mainly for the benefit of the member for Werriwa. In my electorate at the moment a feedlot is being built called the Prime City Feedlot. It is about 40 kilometres west of Griffith and both the Carrathool Shire Council and the Griffith City Council are involved. This business is going to have about 60,000 cattle&mdash;one of Australia's largest feedlots&mdash;and a throughput of 150,000 cattle during any one year. This feedlot will have a dramatic effect on the economy of south-eastern Australia, and not just the Griffith and Goolgowi districts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To enable this feedlot to be set up, we need infrastructure and road systems. The road system at the moment is hopeless because of years of neglect by both state and federal governments. Now this feedlot is going to produce income for Australia. Let us keep in mind that the current account deficit, which was announced today, is $2.25 billion. If the government does not want to stop spending, it has to earn more money. The only place it is going to earn most of this money is in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upgrading the road system in that area will cost about $30 million. That is a lot of money but we need it to produce exports. This amount of money invested by the federal government will earn $1.2 billion per annum for the people of that area and this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People from the office of the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) have been down to have a look at the development and said, `I'm sorry, under most of the programs we can't do anything. We will look at it if you set up a regional economic development committee.' So the light is not completely out. This is just one example of where we can produce export dollars, but we have to have infrastructure and roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural roads are particularly important. As I previously mentioned, two out of three export dollars earned for Australia are earned in rural areas. We must get infrastructure into those areas. If we get the infrastructure there, we will get development and help pay the bills for this government. But, with the way that we are going, we will continue to be on the slides, as we are at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am surprised that the newspapers and media today are not up in arms. We seem to have become accustomed to having $2 billion plus current account deficits every month. People who take the laissez-faire approach say, `This is wonderful. We are down to $2 billion.' We have to create infrastructure in order to create wealth for this country. We have to spend part of the $10 billion that is collected in fuel tax to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Infrastructure aside, look at the level of tax that some transport drivers pay. They have paid $6,000 per rig per year in additional tax since this government was re-elected in 1993. That is working against creating the wealth of the nation and trying to get the economy back on track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that we in rural areas pay all this tax on fuel. One only has to travel through my electorate to see how the cost of fuel increases the further west one goes. I admit that increases in the price of fuel are not all due to increases in tax, but those increases are far more than what should be expected for those living in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to see the New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, come out and say that he will have an inquiry into the price of fuel. I wish him the best of luck, because we have had many of them before and nothing has happened. I hope that something happens with this one. He will certainly have my gratitude if it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that we must, through either the office of the Minister for Housing and Regional Development or the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), do something about creating infrastructure in rural areas, where most of the wealth of this nation is developed. If the government will not stop spending money, we have to do something about creating more wealth. One way that we will do this is for the government to have a closer look at this proposal. I hope that members of Minister Howe's office come back to the Riverina and look at this development. There have been others that have tried to create some wealth, but they have not developed as we would have liked. We do not have adequate infrastructure in rural Australia. We have to do something about it. I hope that under proposed programs the minister will see his way clear to assist. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to say a few words today about the transport of this country. The issue of transport being taken for granted is well exampled by the comments that have been made by previous government speakers. We have a great reliance in this country on transport because of our geographic distances and because about 70 or 80 per cent of our exports have to come out of regional Australia. My electorate of Grey is the third largest in the country and, therefore, I am acutely aware of the impact that government policy has on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a national context there seems to me, from my short time in this House, to be a glaring example of a lack of a coordinated approach. I do not altogether blame the federal government, although it has had an opportunity in the last 12 years to do a heck of a lot more than it has been able to achieve. There is not sufficient understanding of the relationship between road and rail transport. The National Rail Corporation is endeavouring to bring a stronger and more coordinated approach to rail, but there is no research in this country, to my knowledge, of the relationship between road and rail. That should be done with great urgency, and I know that the coalition in government will achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some comment made about the collections of excise. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) tried to pull the furphy that there was only $5 billion collected. I am glad that the deputy whip from the National Party was able to pull him up pretty quickly on that one. It is worth remembering that with the focus on regional development that will play a key role at the next election the government is proposing to spend about $160 million over the next four years as its contribution to revitalising regional Australia. In one year in this country we collect an extra $2 billion in excise, most of that ending up back in and impacting on regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember that at the last election the government said that there would be no new taxes. Immediately it was elected it increased tax, particularly excise. That is one of the great double standards this government will need to explain to the people at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of the waterfront, one of the great frustrations in my electorate about the ports is the WIRA agreement, the compensation paid for restructuring. People receive handsome payouts of up to $300,000 or $400,000, go out the door on a Friday and then many of them are rehired at casual labour rates that are higher than the rates of pay on which they finished up. That is just one of the things adding to the costs. We are all reliant on export income but those who are directly reliant on it are particularly frustrated when they see what they perceive to be rorts&mdash;I was trying to think of a more generous word&mdash;like that. There has been some improvement but we are still well behind world best practice on our waterfront. If we want a competitive export industry that will deal with our current account deficit we have to have a far stronger recognition of the transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long the transport industry has been taken for granted. I hear people within the rail industry, the road industry and the stevedoring industry saying, `We have been here so long, we are taken for granted. There is not a sufficiently coordinated program. We are seen as a tax milch cow. People are not getting their minds around the hard issue of producing the infrastructure needed to take us into the next century.' It is very important for this country to have an internationally competitive transport system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes available to me I would like to talk about some of the points that the member has raised. He mentioned fair retail pricing of fuel. Is the member for Wannon aware that this is a state issue? Is he aware that in 1973 the people rejected, by 70 per cent to 30 per cent, Commonwealth price control? Has he complained to the Kennett government in Victoria about its refusal to accept its responsibility and provide fair prices for the people of Victoria?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that a representative of the party that purports to be the champion of states rights would identify where the responsibility for this issue lies. It does not lie with the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He mentioned the waterfront. Where would the opposition be without the age-old sport of wharfie bashing? It is certainly alive and well on the coalition back bench and generally comes from rural and regional members who do not have a port in their electorate and do not understand what waterfront reform has achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech, the member for Wannon failed to acknowledge a number of the changes that have taken place. The three-year reform from 1989 to 1992 reduced the number of stevedores from 8,900 to 3,800. The turnaround times improved. The container handling rates increased from 13 containers in an hour in 1989 to 20 an hour in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He did not acknowledge that there were productivity gains at wheat terminals that gave the wheat industry a $35 million a year saving. In my region of the Hunter, the Port Waratah Coal Services recently invested $100 million in a second coal loading facility which enables two bulk coal carriers to be turned around in 24 hours, each of them being loaded with in excess of 100,000 tonnes of coal. It is the most efficient and best coal loading facility in Australia. It is in my area and I am proud of it. But that is the sort of thing that is happening all over Australia, not only in the Hunter, when we use initiative. Are these the things that the member for Wannon is talking about when he criticises our waterfront industries? I really think his argument is empty rhetoric and based on ignorance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Wannon mentioned underinvesting in transport infrastructure. Again, he is unclear about what he is criticising. His speech was just the traditional broad brush approach without specifics. Has he told us that his part of the world is about to receive the benefits of a federally funded standard gauge railway that will see Adelaide linked to Melbourne by a standard gauge? That will be opened on 4 June, which is just next week. For the first time in Australia, all Australian capitals will be connected by a standard gauge rail, with dedicated freight lines to speed both freight and commuter travel, including 24-hour access to freight terminals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the member for Wannon wants to talk about road funding.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Fisher told the annual conference . . . that any increase could hurt rural Australia by increasing Government borrowings and pushing up interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there will be no extra money for rural roads. The member for Wannon really is in a bind. He wants the federal government to intervene on states rights when his own party supports states rights. He wants the federal government to increase borrowings and spending when his own party, his own leader and his own shadow Treasurer want this government to cut spending and borrowing.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)calls on the Government to have the tax deductibility of litigation costs further examined by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration.</PARA>
<PARA>In the 10 minutes I have been allowed in this debate, I do not wish to argue the case for non-deductibility of legal expenses, but I want to argue that the tax deductibility of litigation costs should be referred by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration for thorough examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its action plan, the Access to Justice Advisory Committee devoted chapter 8 to tax deductibility of legal costs. The Trade Practices Commission, in its report, found many aberrations in the tax and court systems, because tax deductibility of legal expenses was provided for one litigant in a litigation process while being denied to the other private litigant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will summarise some of the points made from those reports, starting with the report of the Trade Practices Commission. Firstly, the report found that tax deductibility may create distortions in the market which, in turn, create a bias in favour of business and a disincentive to compromise disputes prior to litigation. Secondly, tax deductibility may be a factor in excessive demands placed on limited court resources. This pressure on the courts and judges is all too obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, strong equity considerations point to the need for a review of the current law, in particular the financial imbalance between private litigants and business litigants. Fourthly, the report raised the question of whether tax deductibility should be withdrawn entirely from legal expenses or whether, in cases where the other party cannot claim legal expenses as a deduction, it should similarly be denied to business litigants. This would not deny a business enterprise its right to litigate, but it would even up the field considerably between the two. Finally, the fact that the cost of non-tax deductibility of litigation expenses would fall heaviest on the insurance and banking industry comes as no surprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some points made in the report of the Access to Justice Advisory Committee are as follows. Firstly, the test of tax deductibility tends to be more lenient for business than for individuals not conducting business. Secondly, the New South Wales Law Society criticised tax deductibility of legal expenses as creating an incentive for business to litigate rather than use dispute resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there is an inequity between business litigants and the individual, because one can rely on tax deductions and the other cannot. The report said that, because of this inequity, the general body of taxpayers&mdash;including the private litigant&mdash;is subsidising the business litigant's decision to litigate. Finally, the deductibility of the business litigant's legal expenses could accentuate imbalances of bargaining power in the litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Access to Justice Advisory Committee concluded in action 8.1 that the government should commission a review of the current law and practice governing the tax deductibility of litigation legal expenses. I am interested in this motion because I am one of only two continuing members of the House of Representatives committee that produced the report on banking and deregulation entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A pocket full of change</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of recommendation 60 of the committee's report calling for independent mediators to overcome what the committee saw were the obvious facts outlined by the Trade Practices Commission and the Access to Justice Advisory Committee, there are many instances where some banks are still pursuing litigation for the purpose of forcing the private litigant into bankruptcy and ensuring their inability to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 17 of our report investigated specifically foreign currency loans. In rejecting a call for a royal commission&mdash;sought by the then Senator McLean and the Foreign Borrowers Association&mdash;the committee recommended that the `Westpac letters' be referred to the National Crime Authority. Unfortunately, the referral was not accepted by the National Crime Authority. If it had been accepted perhaps some of the continuing litigation cases would have been already settled more amicably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one of the House of Representatives committee's conclusions&mdash;15.89, page 265&mdash;the committee regarded as serious the allegations of abuse of process by means of banks' delaying tactics and poor discovery. This led to recommendations Nos 49 and 50 asking that the Australian Law Reform Commission examine this abuse of process and that a Senate committee investigate the cost of justice issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that the problems presented by witnesses to our inquiry still continue, as does the abuse of the legal system. As a result there is no equity for the private litigant. That is due partially to the tax deductibility aspect of litigation costs and the fact that private litigants have limited funding and access to justice as compared with the funding power of the banks themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also disappointed in the response of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) of 9 March to my request to have this matter examined. He repeated what we all know about tax deductibility. But his comment that `the government considers that the current taxation treatment of legal expenses does not disadvantage an individual's access to the legal system' shows that either the government or the Assistant Treasurer&mdash;or both&mdash;are completely out of touch with the reality as indicated by the Trade Practices Commission and the Access to Justice Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the committee's inquiry I have had close links with six cases involving foreign currency loans. Four of those cases have been settled&mdash;compromised with the banks' insistence that there be no publication or comment by the litigant on the terms of settlement, thus denying other litigants the ability to find out what the courts are thinking. The process of this particular type of abuse is outlined in a letter I received from one of the litigants. I shall refer to the company involved as `X company'. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A brief outline of our case against [X company] and where we consider costs were deliberately incurred unnecessarily.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.We commenced action against [X company] in 1989.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.We attempted to withdraw our appeal to the High Court (still without legal representation) in favour of mediation . . . [X company]'s lawyers again misled the High Court as to our intention to withdraw and had us `struck out'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.On 23 December 1992 we attended a mediation . . . [X company] appeared at this meeting with lawyers from three separate firms . . . This was the same legal team that had been against us through the trial . . . As we had no legal representation we requested talking to [X company]'s  representative . . . alone. He told us that [X company] would not proceed with the conference unless all the legal advisers remained . . . [X company]'s lawyers said words to the effect; "You cannot expect our client ([X company]) to give you any money&mdash;it has cost them over a million dollars to get this judgment against you."</PARA>
<PARA>One million dollars in legal expenses! The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.[X company] then attempted to bankrupt us. At three separate Bankruptcy Hearings [X company] has appeared with up to six legal representatives, two of whom have been Senior Counsel . . .</PARA>
<PARA>They were the representatives before bankruptcy proceedings from X company. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17.Finally, while . . . lawyers have had access to unlimited funds (subsidised by The Australian Taxation Office) they will continue . . . to make a mockery of the Justice System and the Mediation Process System. There is absolutely no reason or incentive for them not to litigate to the death of it's victims.</PARA>
<PARA>I have equally damning evidence from another source, but time does not allow me to refer to the matter. But if there were an inquiry, I am sure that that evidence would be presented in person. I wish to say that not all banks, all insurances or all businesses approach litigation encouraged by the tax deductibility of litigation expenses, but some obviously do. </PARA>

Of course the committee was brilliantly chaired by the now Speaker of the House of Representatives, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), together with his colleagues, such as the honourable member for Dawson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we need to explain for ordinary Australians just what tax deductibility means, particularly in banking. Take farms, for example. If a bank takes a farmer to court to repossess the farm on the basis of a failed mortgage and,  incidentally, not being compelled to mediate, spends $1 million and that farmer spends $50,000, the bank is entitled to claim $1 million as an expense of business. What this means is that taxpayers are subsidising the litigation. We are subsidising it to the tune of 36c for every dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that, when a powerful committee, an important committee, such as that responsible for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A pocket full of change</EMPHASIS>, gives a signal on behalf of the people of Australia that it would like to see more mediation, the people of Australia should reasonably expect banks to pick this up. I regret to hear the member for Dawson saying that they have not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the farming community, I think it is an absolute tragedy that banks are happily foreclosing on farmers without resorting to mediation. In fact, there is only one state in Australia that has introduced legislation to force compulsory bank mediation for farmers&mdash;that state is New South Wales. I am pleased to say that the then shadow spokesman for consumer affairs and now Minister for Agriculture, Richard Amery, was at the forefront of that fight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I support this motion to commission an inquiry, I have to say that the big end of town, especially banks and insurance companies, should not be subsidised when hitting the battlers or the little people. In the whole area of banking, we have got a lot of benefits out of deregulation. Whilst I would be the last one to want to turn back the clock, I think we have failed to set up proper protection for consumers. Some members might ask me, `Why has the independent banking ombudsman not intervened in the cases spoken about by the member for Dawson?' Firstly, the independent banking ombudsman is an industry ombudsman paid for by industry. Secondly, small business is precluded from such areas of operation. What we are finding is that a whole raft of people need consumer protection&mdash;not just Mr and Mrs Average but also small business and farmers. We have a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Banking is no ordinary private enterprise arrangement. The honourable member for Dawson is not permitted to go out and establish a bank in his electorate or in my electorate. It requires a government licence. Not every company that applies for a licence is entitled to get one. Unlike other businesses, we have the operations of the Reserve Bank, which, even though it does not guarantee deposits, ensures there is no collapse or denigration of depositors' funds. It is almost a fail-safe business&mdash;even when businesses haemorrhage, as the banks did in the eighties with their corporate lending policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people operate with a government licence. They are huge institutions. It may be pleasing to shareholders that they are earning a billion dollars per company profit, but we have to be satisfied that they are doing things in the national interest, that they are marshalling and husbanding the nation's savings and that they are not using their economic power unfairly or improperly in dealings with their customers. In that regard, I was most amused to read that the ANZ Bank said, `You should not be interfering with our dealings with customers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend to honourable members an article in the New South Wales House of Assembly <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> where Mick Clough, the honourable member for Bathurst, talks about what has happened to the farming community in its dealings with banks and financial institutions. It has been nothing short of a scandal. We should ensure that banks deal properly, fairly and justly with customers and explore every opportunity for a proper and appropriate outcome. Their use of foreclosure, their use of the legal system and their bankrupting of farmers are able to be done because of unequal economic power and the fact that the Commonwealth and ordinary taxpayers are subsidising their legal activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dawson mentioned a case about a foreign bank loan. The borrowers' court costs came to $300,000. Can you imagine that the bank would have turned up with some suburban solicitor to defend the case? Of course not. There would have been fees for instructing solicitors, a top silk or QC and a junior.

I hope that the motion moved by the honourable member for Dawson will attract the support of both sides of the House&mdash;and in its proposition and seconding, it does&mdash;and that we will see such a reference.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are many horror stories involving banks and small investors. I submit this one to the House because of the wider problems it illustrates. Dick and Robyn Van Rheeden were a retired couple living on the northern beaches of Sydney. In the late 1980s they signed a contract to buy home units on the Gold Coast. After the 1987 stock market crash, they were going to let the contracts lapse and forfeit their deposit but, after a visit from their local Westpac manager, they felt reassured that the value of the units and the value of the family home meant that they could go ahead and complete the transaction. So they borrowed a very large sum of money from Westpac.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it happened, the property market crashed, the units did not sell, interest mounted higher and higher, and eventually Westpac sold the Van Rheedens' home to cover their debts. The Van Rheedens claim that they had gone into this purchase only on Westpac's advice that they could afford it. Essentially, the subsequent legal case turned on who was to be believed&mdash;the Van Rheedens, who claimed that Westpac's representatives were responsible for their loss, or the Westpac manager, who claimed that he had made no formal representations about the value of the Van Rheedens' assets. As it happened, the trial judge believed the bank manager and not the Van Rheedens, probably because he found that Mrs Van Rheeden was in a highly emotional condition and had taken a set against the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From being comfortably well off, the Van Rheedens had been reduced to living out of suitcases and in rented houses. They accept that they acted unwisely, but they are concerned to ensure that, where two dollar-struck parties&mdash;a bank and a private citizen&mdash;enter a deal, it is not just the private citizen who bears the loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three issues here. The first is the tendency of judges to believe professionals rather than lay people. No doubt, when compared to Westpac's manager, the Van Rheedens were highly emotional, almost distraught, witnesses. Let us face it: Westpac's manager was going to get paid regardless of the outcome of the case whereas the Van Rheedens stood to lose their whole life savings. Right now we are understandably anxious to eliminate gender bias in the law, but the solidarity of judges for other professionals may be just as insidious in denying justice to deserving individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem, at least on the evidence I have seen, is Westpac's failure to disclose its relationship with AGC, which was financing the home units which the Van Rheedens were trying to buy. Westpac, in other words, had a double interest in the Van Rheedens' purchase: first, the interest income that Westpac would earn on the money borrowed; and, second, the profit AGC would earn&mdash;or more likely the losses AGC would avoid&mdash;if these units sold. The law should require institutions to disclose to their clients their additional financial interests in their clients' affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third problem is the gross disparity in legal firepower between Westpac and the Van Rheedens, who are now my constituents. Pitting the Van Rheedens against Westpac is like Australia playing against Western Samoa. Sure, they play under the same rules and the referee might be fair, but even under those circumstances Australia starts 30 points in front. However, in this case the opponents are not playing under the same rules; and the rules are not fair because if Westpac spends $100,000 defending a legal case, that $100,000 is entirely tax deductible. If a private citizen spends $100,000 taking a legal case, every last cent comes out of after tax dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia argues, quite rightly, for a level playing field for overseas trade. What the Australian government demands of other countries it should grant to its own citizens. Public companies in particular should not have an institutional advantage over their legal opponents. There are many things that could be done to fix this problem. Contingency fees is one; changing the litigation happy atmosphere, where some people are more interested in fees than justice, is another. We should certainly reconsider the tax deductibility status of companies' legal expenses. I am happy to commend this motion to the House. </PARA>

I was a lawyer for a few years and I have a fair degree of sympathy for the accountant's view, so I am also in sympathy with the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some difficulties with the proposition but the suggested mechanism of referring the matter to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is sensible because this issue needs to be examined very closely. We have to recognise that there are plenty of legitimate circumstances in which it would be quite appropriate for a business involved in litigation, including litigation against an individual rather than another corporate entity, to be able to deduct the cost of that litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the honourable member for Dawson that many small businesses in his constituency, for example, would need to chase debtors and would find it extremely difficult to get people to pay up if those businesses were encumbered with the additional burden of not being able to deduct the legal expenses they legitimately incurred in pursuing such things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are plenty of examples of tax deductibility for legal expenses being quite legitimate and no speakers in this debate would disagree with them. However, there is no doubt that the points that have been raised by all speakers in this debate are valid. We do have a problem. How to tackle that problem is the real question. The problem ultimately comes from an inequality in economic power. This means that if a company is very large and is able to bear the cost of litigation, and is also able to deduct the cost from its taxation, it has an enormous advantage over people such as the constituents the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) has cited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my practice as a lawyer I encountered this type of situation very commonly, particularly with groups such as insurance companies. One of the classic examples is total and permanent disability benefit claims under superannuation trust deeds&mdash;I have mentioned this here before&mdash;where the person whose claim has been denied by the insurer has the choice of accepting the result or risking thousands of dollars pursuing a Supreme Court case with maybe a fifty-fifty chance of success. They know that the costs to them if they fail will be enormous and they could lose their house, yet the costs to the insurance company will be written off as a tax deduction. Those are the sorts of problems people face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that a lot of these issues have been tackled in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to justice</EMPHASIS> statement&mdash;and the Sackville report was referred to by the honourable member for Dawson. Such things as increasing access to community legal centres and better legal aid&mdash;and broadening it beyond the heavy focus on criminal legal aid&mdash;are very significant steps forward in tilting the balance of power back a little in favour of small people so that the huge imbalance they tend to face against organisations such as banks and insurance companies is redressed a bit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a lot more to be done; there is a lot more on the agenda&mdash;for example, the abolition of QCs, merging the professions, and allowing others outside the legal profession, including accountants in certain circumstances, to conduct certain functions that lawyers currently have a monopoly on. There is a range of issues that slowly, bit by bit, both the federal government and most of the states are starting to tackle. I was pleased to see that the former New South Wales Liberal government under Premier John Fahey took the lead on the issue of the abolition of QCs. I commend it for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a long list of issues in the legal profession and the legal system in which reform is necessary; for example, the ending of restrictive practices and the streamlining of procedures. Another issue which has been raised by another member in this place is compulsory third party property insurance&mdash;an area where there is inequity in access to the law because of the way the system functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I will make is that the real problem in all of this is not so much the economic power issue. That is a separate issue. It is not the legal system that creates that; the system just reflects it. Economic inequality is a broader issue than that. The real problem is excessive litigation and the fact that tax deductibility tends to create an incentive, particularly for larger corporations, to go all the way in litigation and to avoid mediation by simply saying, `No, we are not interested in talking; we are not interested in settling; we are not interested in resolving sensibly. We are going to fight you all the way to the High Court if you can find the $100,000 to finance your case.' The real problem is that what our system currently does is to encourage excessive litigation so that we have more lawyers in Australia than in the whole of Japan, which of course has about six times our population. We need to look at this issue from both of those angles. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with much of what the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has said. I support the motion to the extent that it does call for a further examination of the issue of tax deductibility of litigation costs. I also join the honourable member for Melbourne in expressing a reservation about the principle involved in that. Whilst I am happy to have another look at it, it obviously requires a very close examination and I do not support that principle wholeheartedly at this point in time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was disappointed that the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) took the opportunity to bash just about everybody involved in this issue. He expressed some very serious reservations about and cast aspersions on the banking ombudsman because she is industry funded. He probably overlooked the fact that the banking ombudsman has actually done a very good job of solving a lot of the complaints that people have had. If he were to read the ombudsman's annual report carefully he would see that many of these disputes are now being settled to the full satisfaction of both the banks and their customers. So the ombudsman, I believe, needs to be given a pat on the back, rather than a kick in the backside, and encouraged to keep going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bank bashing&mdash;and there was an element of that in some of the contributions, and my friend the member for Chifley fell into that trap&mdash;is a bit like motherhood. It is easy to get up here and bash the banks&mdash;and my own close colleague the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) did not actually pull too many punches either. The fact is that most of the banks&mdash;and perhaps all the banks&mdash;have very good relations with most of their customers most of the time. The sorts of circumstances that my colleague the member for Warringah referred to, and the sorts of matters that are brought before the House of Representatives Banking, Finance and Public Administration Committee, of which I am a fairly recent member&mdash;and I respect the longstanding service of the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) on that committee&mdash;are, ultimately, very few compared to the number of banking transactions that go on from day to day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I do not want necessarily to take the more difficult path of defending the banks, because in many respects they have a lot to answer for. I do not think there is any doubt about that. But by and large we should recognise that most banks have good relations with their customers. They realise it is a competitive industry. They realise they will survive only if they do the right thing by their customers. That was one of the aims and objectives of deregulation, which the government, to its credit, brought about. There are elements of that that have not worked, but nobody here&mdash;certainly the member for Chifley made the point&mdash;is arguing for reregulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder where the member for Chifley and others who go down that track want to stop. They may not be arguing for reregulation of the banking industry, but they are certainly arguing for a degree of intervention in customer relations that I think raises some serious question marks. The member for Chifley, for instance, makes the point&mdash;and he is  technically correct&mdash;that there is a sense in which the taxpayers at large are subsidising this tax deductibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if you want to take a very small technical point, that is the case with all tax deductibility. I would view it as the right of any business&mdash;and the banks are not a great exception to this&mdash;to defend the interests of its stockholders. If that means taking legal action, a business is perfectly at liberty to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue altogether is the inequality of power involved in the relationship. There is always inequality of power whether it be between a retailer and a shopping centre owner, a ratepayer and the local council or, on a broader scale, the rich and the poor. There are ways to address that other than taking what I would see, blandly, as a very extreme action of disqualifying the tax deductibility of actions taken legitimately by businesses protecting their interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly take the point of the honourable member for Chifley, that the banks are very privileged in that they are given a licence to operate&mdash;and the honourable member for Chifley asked some good questions about whether those licensing arrangements are, per se, adequate. In other words, as with television licences, such is the public interest involved that they perhaps ought to be subject to some review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I take the view, and my experience as a member of the committee to date has been, that certainly the Reserve Bank, the ombudsman and the degree of competition that exists ought to keep the banks fairly honest and, by and large, the banks ought to have a lot of pressure on them to go about their business practices in a correct way&mdash;which, by and large, is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to justice</EMPHASIS> report is now available; it has just come across my desk and that response, I think, is in many respects very good.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As acknowledged by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), whilst the banking ombudsman does a fair job there has always been some reservation about the fact that the ombudsman has been funded by the banks themselves. That has always been a concern to me because the banks could be seen as either continuing or withdrawing that financial support at any stage. One of the recommendations in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A pocket full of change</EMPHASIS> was to increase the powers and the limits from $100,000 to $200,000 and some of the parameters that the ombudsman could look at, particularly in relation to small business. Unfortunately, those things have not been picked up and I think it is high time that they were as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you would also recall a report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An assessment of tax</EMPHASIS>, last year on the Australian Taxation Office in which this whole question of litigation was also discussed because of the problems caused by the costs to individuals of pursuing actions through the courts. Of course, that report actually recommended a small claims tribunal for small taxpayers which could deal with amounts up to $5,000. I am pleased that the tax office has responded to that and the government will proceed along those lines. That is a good initiative to protect the rights of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for McPherson said, bank bashing is always the flavour of the month but I would suggest the banks create that problem themselves. We do not create that as members of parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Dawson has made extensive reference today to the Westpac papers and the loan borrowings that have come through in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A pocket full of change</EMPHASIS>. Through that we have seen the extent to which banks have power and their financial capacity to take on anyone and everyone to the stage where individuals have had to give up pursuing issues any longer because they could not afford it. When we get to that stage, I think we have major problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was lucky enough to be present at the launch of the Justice Statement in Brisbane in the last couple of weeks. Most people would agree that that statement is a particularly thoughtful and comprehensive response to issues within our courts. I congratulate the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) on the preparation of that report, which the member for McPherson has also referred to today. A lot of the things that have come out of that&mdash;they have been in response to the Access to Justice Advisory Committee's responses&mdash;will go some way to addressing a lot of the issues that we are concerned with today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this motion from the member for Dawson deserves the full support of this House. I hope that we can achieve the last part of the motion particularly, so that these matters are referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration where this whole issue can be re-examined to ensure that the rights of individuals are protected, we once again can bring the banks to heel on this issue and the whole issue of tax deductibility for legal matters is addressed in a full and comprehensive manner. </PARA>

<PARA>Waste is an environmental consideration of a great order. In my electorate of Gilmore debates are currently raging from one municipality to another about where and when local refuse should and should not be placed and also where refuse which is sourced from outside those municipal areas should be placed and how it should be dealt with. In terms of what waste does to the environment, we can look to the space that it takes and the environments and habitats that it covers and takes over with its disposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a percentage of that waste stream, packaging has been variously cited as being as low as 30 per cent to as high as 60 per cent. Therefore, even if one projects the lowest figure that has been cited&mdash;30 per cent&mdash;we can see that it is still a significant part of the waste stream which goes through our society. Ours has been a society of growing waste. One needs to look at all industrial countries to be able to identify that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The burden of that waste stream is borne by local government authorities to a very great extent. That situation does vary from state to state, but a generalisation can be made that the local government authorities are the ones who bear that major burden. That comes through domestic waste from their local areas, such as from town tips. It is also caused where areas are adjacent to or in close proximity to major metropolitan areas such as Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the instance of Sydney, we find that the last state government was involved in the process of organising mega-tips around the Sydney metropolitan area, the idea being that waste translocation facilities would be organised within various local government authorities throughout the urban area. They would then transport their waste by contract out to areas beyond the city's limits. Therefore, those areas are the final landfill repositories. The problems that that has created over the last 50 years in terms of engineering and the cost to the environment have been outrageous. It was always thought that, if it was low and if it was wet, you would fill it. The number of species in the wetland areas which have been demolished because of this process has been quite outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst local government has taken on the burden, the costs to it are far beyond the point of sale. In other words, the marketplace itself is not responsive to those costs which are related to the product. Therefore, something needs to be done to put this all into one confine so that we can actually have an influence on the types and quantities of packaging. I will give an example of package waste. I have two young sons who like ice blocks. If you buy those ice blocks in a traditional supermarket, there are four levels of packaging before you actually get to the good. This is absolutely outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A negative relationship needs to be established with the quantity of packaging; indeed, we need to increase the quality of packaging. To do that, we need to have some economic incentive, or disincentive. In this case, I would consider a packaging tax as the most appropriate regime. A tax on packaging can be levied at the point of manufacture. This would put economic reality back to a place in the waste stream where it can actually have some effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a tax on packaging is passed on to consumers in the cost of that packaging, so be it. Manufacturers are always ready to look at decreasing their cost structures in terms of delivery of goods and services or of manufactured goods. I think there ought to be a strong impetus for those people to restrict the amount of packaging and the types of materials that they put forward. If they did not do that and the cost of packaging was passed on to the consumers, I believe that at least an income stream to handle that material would be generated so that those who have the burden&mdash;local government&mdash;would be able to access that income stream to provide environmentally friendly solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move on to the different materials which are used in packaging. Within any packaging tax there needs to be a recognition of the variability of the environmental friendliness of the disposed materials. In other words, we need to look and see where, say, paper pulp is sourced. If it is sourced in native forests or old-growth forests, obviously it will have a higher negative impact than if it was sourced from waste out of a pine forest. If we look at plastic, we need to consider how the initial materials that went into the making of the plastic came to be in that format. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads to the production process. The production process can be either clean or dirty, and that needs to be reflected in the packaging tax. In other words, we need to develop positive incentives for industries to clean up the processes whereby they make the products which will ultimately become packaging materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to recognise that some industries have already taken quite positive actions. Those industries should be patted on the back. They should be encouraged to continue the actions they are taking in the reuse and recycle programs. Glass is obviously one of those industries, but there are a number of others. In particular, I signal waste recycling which takes place in the paper and pulp industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to apply this packaging tax to all domestic and foreign products. In many instances, the foreign products are the worst offenders. We would need to make sure that domestic producers who were forced to comply with this packaging tax would not be adversely affected by imports which were not forced to comply. The local government needs to get the dollars directly from such a packaging tax. The main purpose for that is so that those who are doing the job actually have the resources to carry it out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there needs to be strong enforcement. For too long there has been too much rhetoric. The days of rhetoric are over. We need to have some positive actions which recognise that this is the case; that this is not some dream from some environmental feral; that this is in fact reality. I come from a background of local government. I was on the garbage committee. We tried to resite tips for many years, and I can say that it is one of the most difficult jobs anyone could encounter. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) may be correct in his claim that the major burden for waste management is borne by local government authorities, but it is appropriate to acknowledge the fact that in the 1980s many of these same local government authorities acted to effectively treble the amount of domestic waste directed to landfill when they decided to adopt the 240-litre mobile garbage bin system. They were warned at the time of the problems the MGB system would create, but they chose to ignore the warning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure no-one doubts the good intentions of the honourable member in moving this motion. However, it does seem rather a pity that, as a former school teacher, he did not bother to do his homework first. I say to the honourable member: sorry, but this little effort certainly does not deserve an elephant stamp. Although we can give him a big tick for his opening pronouncement, there is no doubt he is quite correct when he states that waste management is a major environmental consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, he scores nought out of 100 for his next statement, which forms the basis of and justification for this ill-conceived packaging tax proposal. His assertion that a major source of the waste stream is derived from packaging is demonstrably incorrect. Packaging is not a major source of the waste stream. In fact, it constitutes only about 10 per cent of the urban solid waste stream. Garden refuse, industrial waste, builders' rubble and other organic and food wastes are all significantly larger components. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why, therefore, is the honourable member targeting packaging? Why is he suggesting a packaging tax instead of a garden refuse tax, a building rubble tax or a food waste tax? Perhaps it is because, like so many other people, he simply does not understand very much about the packaging industry, how it operates and the reason why it exists. Perhaps it is because packaging not only has the disadvantage of being very visible but also inevitably ends its life as a discard. It is therefore a very easy target to attack&mdash;albeit wrongly&mdash;as being unnecessary or wasteful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it may be correct that generally packaging does not enjoy a favourable reputation, it is certainly true that this unfavourable status is undeserved. In many instances, packaging saves more waste than it creates. The basic functions of packaging are to contain, preserve, protect and provide information. Without packaging, materials handling would be difficult, inefficient and uneconomic, but this does not mean the packaging industry does not have an environmental conscience; in fact, the Australian packaging industry has a long history of environmental responsibility and achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hardly surprising that the reduction of packaging at source has been a major priority of the Australian packaging industry. It makes good sense for packaging companies to seek to minimise packaging. Less packaging means reduced production costs. Reduced production costs mean lower product prices. Lower product prices mean increased competitiveness and a greater share of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The local food packaging industry is a good example. Packaging material suppliers, packaging manufacturers and filling equipment suppliers have worked in close cooperation to achieve significant reductions such as decreasing the weight of containers by reducing wall thicknesses; wherever possible and appropriate substituting lighter packaging materials for heavier alternatives; using composite packages that require less material overall; taking advantage of computer aided design systems to redesign packages and container profiles; producing larger unit sizes to reduce package to produce ratios; and producing products in concentrated form. In Australia, over the past 20 years, these industry initiatives in source reduction have resulted in significant decreases in the overall usage of a wide range of packaging materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let the facts speak for themselves. Since 1980 the weight of a 375-millilitre beer stubby has been reduced by 35 per cent and the weight of a standard 440-gram fruit can has been reduced by 18 per cent. Since 1970 a weight saving of 30 per cent has been achieved with corrugated shipping boxes used for general grocery products; and folding cartons, such as those used for breakfast cereals, have had their weight reduced by 15 per cent. Since 1975 the weight of gable top milk and juice cartons has been reduced by 23 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1979 the weight of long life aseptic cartons has been reduced by 15 per cent. Since 1969 a weight saving of 29 per cent has been achieved for 375-millilitre aluminium beer and soft drink cans. Since 1986 the weight of 200-millilitre polystyrene yoghurt tubs has been reduced by 20 per cent. Since 1980 the HDPE milk bottle has been reduced in weight by 30 per cent. Since their introduction in the late 1970s, the weight of PET soft drink bottles has been reduced by 38 per cent. The list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very unfortunate and rather difficult to understand why so little recognition has been given to the packaging industry for these and similar initiatives, which have significantly contributed to minimising waste, whilst at the same time conserving raw materials, energy and landfill tipping space. The honourable member for Gilmore wants to reward the industry's efforts by slugging it with a packaging tax. The harder it tries, the more he wants to penalise it. It simply does not make sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be different if the industry was actively working to increase the amount and weight of packaging, but the reverse is the case. How about a little reward for effort&mdash;some acknowledgment of, and praise for, the results so far achieved. Amongst the factors the member for Gilmore suggests should be taken into account in assessing his proposed unreasonable, illogical and unwarranted impost on the packaging industry is whether or not the different materials used in packaging can be recycled or reused. He also suggested a packaging tax would discourage the quantity of packaging used on individual products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The packaging industry already has an excellent record on reuse and recycling. It was actively recycling long before the environment became a popular issue and it is certainly not content to rest on its laurels. It is significant that the impressive results attained so far&mdash;superior to virtually all other industries&mdash;have been achieved on a voluntary basis. In regard to discouraging the quantity of packaging used on individual products, it is not all that simple. Apart from the examples I have already quoted, which clearly demonstrate the packaging industry's commitment in this regard, it should be remembered that there are minimums that must be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adequate and appropriate packaging is essential to protect the quality and nutrition of food from damage and contamination and to prevent or minimise spoilage. There is a very real danger that food safety and public health may be jeopardised by ill-conceived regulatory measures aimed at controlling or reducing packaging waste, such as the proposal we are debating today. It is vital that policies aimed at minimising the possible environmental impact of food packaging, however apparently worthy in their appeal, should in no way compromise the degree&mdash;the very high degree&mdash;of food safety, quality and nutrition presently enjoyed by the Australian consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, it is a fact that the packaging of food products not only reduces spoilage but also reduces the amount of waste going to landfill. Overseas studies have shown that cities in countries using a high level of food packaging have considerably less waste entering landfill than cities in countries with limited access to packaged food. Without the benefit of packaging to preserve food, a higher proportion of spoilage occurs and, therefore, a greater amount of waste is consigned to the garbage collection for landfill disposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems somewhat incongruous for the honourable member for Gilmore to feel that by imposing further taxes&mdash;and heaven knows we have enough of those already&mdash;we will solve a problem that industry is already actively and very successfully confronting. If he wants to tax someone&mdash;and the Labor Party is very good at doing that&mdash;then why single out the packaging industry? If local government authorities are bearing a major part of the burden of the cost of waste management, I ask: why do they not start charging on a user-pays basis for their garbage collection services? The more you tip, the more you pay. That would be much fairer. At least it might make people think before they throw. It might encourage more home composting, more active domestic recycling, more careful thought about the fact that our society is using natural resources at an unsustainable rate and creating more waste than can be disposed of without environmental damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian packaging industry has a sound environmental record, one that has been achieved by working cooperatively and constructively with governments whilst at the same time devoting considerable resources to educational and community programs which have an environmental focus. The industry has a record of commitment to recycling and waste management which is superior in quality and duration to that of most other countries. The success of the packaging industry in meeting its recycling commitments and delivering responsible environmental outcomes indicates that a voluntary, cooperative and constructive approach&mdash;not legislation, and certainly not more taxes&mdash;is the best way forward. At the risk of adding to the existing landfill problem, I suggest that the honourable member's motion be consigned straight to the tip; it does not even deserve to be recycled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to rise and support the motion which has been moved by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) this afternoon in the House. The motion to introduce a packaging tax, amongst other measures, to achieve and recognise some changes that are needed within the Australian packaging industry is timely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say to the member for Casey (Mr Halverson) that there is certainly no inference to be drawn from the member for Gilmore's motion&mdash;certainly nothing that I can see&mdash;that I will be going to the supermarket and buying my loaf of bread, my Weeties, et cetera, without there being any packaging on those items, as that would mean I would be purchasing food which is open to input from vermin, contamination, and so forth, during its travels from the producer to the consumer. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is evident that the whole issue which has been raised here this afternoon has touched on the nerves of those on different sides of the House&mdash;which is, no doubt, a good thing. Let us have a nice, vigorous debate about the different aspects of where the industry is at present and where different members would like to see it going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some achievements overall in the environmental considerations and movements towards reduction of waste across the different sections of industry as a whole. The whole movement towards that certainly gained a big impetus several years ago and led very quickly to the recognition that we in Australia do not have industries geared up and in place to handle the amount of material that can be recycled. That became a bit of an embarrassment in different places where material was simply stockpiled because there was not a market for it. If I have time, I will come back to the issue of the creation of markets for recyclable material, to ensure that the amount that is recycled is increased and that people's efforts at being part of the recycling process are duly rewarded with that knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In different parts of the world there have been different approaches to this. No doubt Australia has led the world in some areas. It has certainly been a little behind the eight ball in different aspects. This afternoon the member for Gilmore has brought to the House a recognition that some areas of the industry need a bit of a push along. At the same time, we recognise that the best way is not just a stick but certainly a carrot as well&mdash;that is, some incentives for the industry to move at its own pace. At the same time, there has to be a bit of a lead there to ensure that the pace is realistic in what can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been considerable improvements in solid waste management in Australia. However, one only has to go into a supermarket or anywhere else&mdash;I talk about not just food but also other packaging material in different types of shops and retail outlets&mdash;to know that there is still a considerable amount of useless and superfluous packaging going into the products we buy. When you go into a supermarket and buy items of food, for instance&mdash;that is what the member for Casey was so concerned about; he seemed to use the emotive part of his argument to downgrade the motion of the member for Gilmore&mdash;you find that it is not unusual for there to be three or four containers encompassing the article you wish to buy. There will be a sterile and sealed container of quite strong security, due to the new technology that is able to be used. There will be one, two or three different cardboard packages surrounded by another plastic or cellophane type product which seals the whole lot up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, even in the food area, which the member for Casey was so concerned about, there is certainly room for improvement. That is certainly true in many other areas also. When you buy a shirt, you find that there is more than enough cardboard to wrap the shirt three times, let alone to have it bundled up and nicely presented for the purpose of retail. Certainly the plastics and so forth which go into that can be done away with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion calls for a packaging tax to `recognise the different materials used in packaging and the ability of such material to be recycled or reused' and to `recognise the environmental friendliness of the production process of the materials used in packaging'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, we have to recognise that we have to create markets for the recycled material. At the same time, the industries have to have some responsibility for the fact that the material they produce and recycle can be harmful to the environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the goodwill of the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) in moving this motion, but I have to say to him right at the outset: as far as Australia is concerned, no more taxes! Australia is being taxed to death right now. He wants to introduce additional taxes which will increase the cost of goods for every ordinary Australian family. I cannot believe that this is what he really wants to do; he just does not understand what he is doing. He says in his motion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . waste management is a major environmental consideration . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Of course it is. Everybody knows that. Everybody agrees with that. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a major source of the waste stream is derived from packaging in its various forms . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is wrong. Ten per cent is the correct figure. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the major burden for waste management is borne by local government authorities . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Again, this is part of the strange thinking of government members in this parliament. They think government has money. They think local government pays the cost of waste management. It is you and I and the people you and I represent in our electorates who pay. People pay&mdash;not governments. Governments have no money. If you are going to impose a tax to increase the costs of consumer goods to no great benefit, it is the people who are going to have to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A balanced approach to economic and environmental issues is a central issue for the Australian economy and, indeed, for the global economy. Consumers are far more aware today of the impact of waste on our environment, and that is a great thing. I am even pleased to say&mdash;I will praise the government, as I frequently do&mdash;that it has introduced $5.5 million in the recent budget for continued education on such things as recycling and building codes. That is a step in the right direction. We do need to re-educate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People should realise that the packaging industry is working well at solving the problem itself. Paper and paper board weight has been reduced by 25 per cent over the past 25 years. The recovery rate by the year 2000 will be 45 per cent with new recycling plants at Nowra and Albury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also bear in mind that one of the difficulties we have in selling our wastepaper is that there are overseas subsidies. It is not just the Australian farmers and primary producers who are being affected by these subsidies. For example, the Dutch sell their mixed wastepaper to Indonesia for $30 a tonne. The freight from Europe is $50 a tonne. They are even putting subsidies on wastepaper to try to get into markets which should really be ours. We have to maximise the free labour that is used by Australian families all around this wonderful country in sorting things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Recycling is improving all the time in the steel industry. The overall recycling rate of steel is 70 per cent. Seventy per cent of all steel is recycled. Unfortunately, in municipal scrap&mdash;and this is where that free labour for sorting comes in&mdash;cans and small steel items are only being recycled at the rate of two to three per cent. The target is to get that up to 25 per cent. We are hopeful that, with the cooperation of the mums and dads of Australia, this can be achieved because steel is easy to separate, by magnetic means, from other garbage. This is going to be one area where we can make some definite progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fairness to the packaging industry, it has got to be realised that they are not foolish people; they are doing the best that is available right now. Nobody in their right mind who is a manufacturer or a user of packaging is going to use more than they need. The member for Richmond (Mr Newell) made some reference to sealed and sterile containers on the outside and then other containers on the inside. Does he really want to get food that can be contaminated in an unsealed and unsterile form of packaging? I find that absolutely amazing. The reality is that, if you look at the situation with a fair and open mind, it is packaging that has allowed the growth of civilisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion of the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott). It has put the whole issue of environmental safety and efficiency on the agenda. For that I applaud the energy of the member for Gilmore. From the thrust of the responses of those opposite, they are probably going to ask for a subsidy for the packaging industry since it is doing us so much good. They will be asking for a tax cut.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the packaging industry is very important. It provides $4 billion annually and employs 31,000 people. I have no doubt that the statistics mentioned by the member for Casey (Mr Halverson) are accurate. As the 1994 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waste Disposal</EMPHASIS> said at item 11.40:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was told that the most important aspect of waste disposal in Australia was the financial aspect and it was not being addressed correctly. It is only when the full implications of waste were factored into the production process that industry will have a real incentive to minimise wastes created by its products and packaging.</PARA>
<PARA>The thrust of this motion is to make sure that all sectors in the community take their responsible part in making sure that we do not further affect the environment. There is no doubt, as the Senate standing committee also indicated, that local government, the public sector, do take a fair bit of the expense of handling packaging. For instance, in the evidence to the committee, on page 255, the Local Government and Shires Association of New South Wales said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Sydney councils are subsidising industry by $3.9 million per annum for the collection of materials that industry consistently reminds the community are recyclable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government is also subsidising the state government to the tune of $2 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA>We really need to look at where the costs and benefits are. For all the benefits that the opposition has mentioned there are costs, even though I agree packaging is only one factor of environmental issues in relation to recycling and the use of waste. It has been assessed that environmental benefits of recycling are the following: reduction of energy use, 23 to 74 per cent; reduction of air pollution, 74 per cent; reduction of water pollution, 35 per cent; and, reduction of water use, 58 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has obviously been taken up by the Commonwealth government and the Council of Australian Governments. As part of the national strategy for ecologically sustainable development in 1992, the Council of Australian Governments agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . work to ensure the costs associated with changing waste management practises do not fall disproportionately on industry and local authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>It does involve making sure that all of us, including the community, are involved. The report of the committee at item 11.39 further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The community must be made aware of the true costs of waste collection and disposal, and these economic incentives could result in a reduction of material going to landfill and incineration, provide further incentives to recycle, reduce the pressure on the environment, and provide funds for further research and development of alternative technologies.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the positive initiatives made have assisted in involving communities. In Queensland since 1990, 78 per cent of households have had access to council based recycling programs and 68 per cent of households have had kerbside collection. This has had a major impact so that now, in Queensland, 44 kilograms of material are recovered per person per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time available, I want to pay tribute to the Rockhampton City Council for its recycling endeavours. It received an award from Ian Kiernan, the founder of Clean Up Australia Day, on 16 June 1994. Mr Kiernan stated that Rockhampton's recovery rates were the highest in the country. Recycling had reduced landfill levels at the council tip by 73 per cent in two years, which was over and above the national targets. I believe it indicates what can be done if local councils involve the community through education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate and pick up many of the comments made by the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell). While I appreciate that she was not being entirely parochial in her support of what has happened in Queensland, I stand here as a South Australian from a state that has a very proud record in container recycling and waste management generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That may seem like a hopelessly parochial statement to make. I say to my colleagues in the eastern states: you need only travel as I do from time to time between Canberra and Adelaide across the Hay plains to see the number of containers on the Sturt Highway that have been thrown from cars and the change that occurs when you cross the border into South Australia, which gives me some justification for my remarks. I am proud to be a South Australian with our existing container recycling legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one point on which I disagree with the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) is his call for a packaging tax. I share with other members on this side of the House my concern for another tax regime. I want to reinforce that fact by using the words of the member for Richmond (Mr Newell) who, in addressing this debate, called on legislation to be a carrot and not a stick in order to encourage better packaging management in this nation. I entirely agree. The whole secret of success in South Australia&mdash;I say this for the information of the member for Gilmore&mdash;has been that the legislation has effectively been a carrot and not a stick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What exists in container recycling incentives in South Australia is not a tax but the opportunity to get a refund for having returned that particular container to a recycling pool. That is the direction we should take and the direction I would encourage the member for Gilmore to take in this whole area of how we develop greater recycling. The member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and the member for Casey (Mr Halverson) have already made the point that as a general rule we use less packaging than we used to. The market dictates that that packaging level ought to fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard with interest the member for Gilmore when he said that he had purchased iceblocks for his sons and had been concerned that in that iceblock process there were four forms of packaging. He did not have an opportunity, because time would not allow him, to elaborate. I was a little mystified because I could not quite see how you could avoid the stick which held up the iceblock. That may not have been what he was wanting to avoid. I was counting that as one. He was saying it was not, but I was trying to draw an analogy. I also felt, as everyone else would agree, that there was a need to have a wrapping around the iceblock for the sake of hygiene and that the iceblock was bound to come in some form of carton or container. So I was running out of areas in which I could prune the packaging concern that he had raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the industries with which I am most familiar, packaging has been reduced over the last decade. I frequently stand here as the representative of the Barossa Valley in defence of the wine industry. It is of interest to me that the wine industry, in trying to minimise its packaging load, has got to the point at which wine is now not simply put in casks, which themselves minimise packaging relative to bottles, but placed in entire shipping containers that are plastic-lined. So they are shipped to their destination as a wine in the container plastic-lined. The plastic-lined container, the balloon if you like, that keeps the wine in that shipping container, is itself then sent back folded to Australia for cleaning and recycling&mdash;I would have thought the sort of move that ought to be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, since like the member for Gilmore I am running out of time, my particular concern about this legislation firstly was the level of tax. I would prefer some form of incentive. My other concern is that the focus of the debate has been on what local government ought to be doing. I agree that this should be an entirely local government initiative but, as such, I would have thought it behoves all of us to be encouraging our state colleagues to introduce some form of legislation at the state level. In South Australia, the state legislation introduced by a Labor government and policed subsequently by a Liberal government has been very successful. This is very much a state and not a Commonwealth initiative. Local government is very much a creature of the states and, as such, this direction that the member for Gilmore rightly wants to steer local government in ought to come as an impetus from state rather than from federal authorities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the motion of the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), I would like to firstly respond to a number of the points that opposition members have made in their speeches on this motion and, in particular, in their opposition to the question of a tax. It is a fairly predictable reaction by the opposition to say, `No, we can't have a tax, we are already overtaxed,' et cetera. But what has to be understood is that in dealing with waste management issues, in dealing with the waste stream that we have in our community, ultimately the consumers will always pay one way or another. If we do not reduce the level of waste, if we do not reduce the level of packaging that we have, we then have to find bigger and more dumps to get rid of rubbish and the councils pay. The councils charge extra rates to their ratepayers to deal with their waste management strategies, and our environment suffers. We then have to spend a lot more federal, state and local government taxes dealing with major environmental problems because we are still chopping down too many trees for production into cardboard and paper for packaging and we have to dig huge holes in the ground to bury our waste, polluting our environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way or another consumers pay. What the member for Gilmore has suggested in his motion is a means of providing some disincentive to companies to use more and more packaging. He is saying to those companies, `If you are going to use bigger and better packaging all the time which the community ultimately has to dispose of you will pay for it. Your product will be more expensive because there will be a tax on it.' That acts as a means of convincing companies and consumers that it is not in their best interests to have that packaging. If we do not put the tax on that product, the tax will be multiplied 10 times over down the stream when councils have to impose greater rates on their ratepayers to deal with waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Waste also has an added impact on our environment. One way or another our country will suffer if we do not come forward with some positive, meaningful ways of dealing with the waste stream in our community. Let us not just reject the motion on the superficial level of, `We are already too overtaxed, so let's not whack another tax on us.' That fails to recognise the fundamental question that we are seeking to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that a lot of the packaging is consumer driven. This is not a motion that condemns the packaging industry and says that it is all their fault. It does not do that at all. We understand that there has been a major drive by consumers for more and more packaging to protect the quality of the product and to protect it from contamination or tampering. Over the last couple of years, we have had a number of instances where tampering has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consumers have to understand that, in requiring that extra packaging, there is a cost. It is not just an immediate cost on the product but a cost to our environment and our community. This is providing a carrot and stick approach. It is something that I think needs to be seriously considered and not just rejected out of hand for the superficial reason that we cannot have another tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), who rightly proudly sang the praises of her local government authority, and the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), who talked about the work in South Australia, I would like to praise the work of the Brisbane City Council. The Brisbane City Council, as the largest local government authority in Australia, has committed itself to a program of reducing Brisbane's landfill by 50 per cent by the year 2000. Three years into that program, it is already well on target to achieving that. It has done that with one of the most comprehensive kerb side recycling programs and a number of other measures designed to reduce the waste stream, and it should be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Brisbane City Council needs is the support of federal and state governments in initiatives like this which are designed to physically reduce the waste stream so that, instead of having to deal with the massive amounts of packaging that consumers purchase, there is a reduction in the level of packaging from the supermarket to the home. Therefore, when it comes to the council's responsibilities, it has much less to deal with. It is in everybody's interest that we positively deal with this issue. It is very much up to all levels of government to address it strongly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) is to be congratulated for bringing this motion before the House. One of the world's major problems is the disposal of waste&mdash;nuclear waste, toxic waste, plain garbage and even space junk. Disposable packaging is a substantial part of that problem. It has increased exponentially since the 1950s. It is no accident that, in the recently published list of Australia's richest men, the second richest made his fortune largely out of packaging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the 1950s, several things have happened. Firstly, the world population has dramatically increased. Secondly, even this rate of growth has been exceeded by the increase in the amount of disposable material being produced. As a result, more and more available public funds are being used for garbage. Most urban councils are now spending about 25 per cent of rates on cleaning, litter and garbage, thus reducing the funds available for many other public needs. Thirdly, the waste we produce is a lot more toxic, non-biodegradable and potentially threatening. Fourthly, the traditional method of disposal by landfill is becoming more difficult and expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have tried to solve the problem by getting bigger garbage tins and tips. Yet cities have become dirtier and, like urban traffic, the volume of garbage simply expands to fill the space available. There is no solution until the heart of the problem is tackled. The volume of waste and associated problems will continue to increase until two basic issues are addressed: firstly, the attitude by individuals that there is a `right' to dispose of private rubbish in public places wherever they go at no cost to themselves; and, secondly, the need for a restraint on the production of waste itself and the sheeting home to the producers of waste the full costs of its disposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These fundamental facts have been obvious for many years, yet public policy and regulatory bodies have continued to be largely apologists for the packaging industry. Massive public subsidies have been maintained and even expanded to ensure the transfer of private costs to the taxpayer. The waste management industry is reported to be now worth some $280 billion per annum; hence the powerful incentive to ensure that the production of waste is not reduced. The industry will continue to argue that any restraint on the production of waste will reduce employment, just as the tobacco, armaments or drug producers do. The manufacturers of the gas chambers in 1941 even pointed out the quality of the construction and the industrial employment they were creating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has always sought to avoid responsibility and continued to create unsustainable mountains of rubbish. Initially they spent millions on the pernicious `Do the right thing' campaign. The idea was to promote a throwaway society by the production of endless disposables, encouraging people to assume the right to drop rubbish wherever they went at no cost to themselves and, more importantly, at no cost to the manufacturer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The theory is now discredited in terms of energy, consumption, the use of natural resources, pollution and the fact that the world is running out of disposal sites. So hey presto! Recycling is now motherhood, along with feelgood Clean Up Australia campaigns. These programs and others promoted by industry front organisations simply deal with symptoms and, to the extent that they are successful, simply facilitate the production of more subsidised waste&mdash;anything to avoid policies of reuse, minimising disposables, reduced consumption or making the creators of waste pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Political and bureaucratic conventional wisdom will promote recycling, thereby ensuring waste creation and consumption continues unabated. Good citizen certificates will be awarded on one side and blame the victim programs on the other. Attempts will be made to shame the public and the recycling police will probably soon be examining your garbage. While ever society continually produces ever-increasing quantities of disposable, non-biodegradable materials without any form of restraint, no real solution is possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only long-term solution to achieve a reduction in disposable waste is to remove subsidies and introduce charges, not taxes, on packaging and deposit legislation on bottles and cans. These systems are gradually being adopted in an increasing number of countries faced with the same problem. Any charges should be based on both the volume and biodegradability of the materials used and will result in a dramatic redesign of a great deal of excessive packaging. The charge would defray part of the public cost of disposal and would have a much greater benefit of reducing the total volume of disposable materials. </PARA>

But, if Manly beach is good enough to promote, it is good enough to bring up to international standard. Manly council estimates that Manly beach needs $7 million spent to restore the seawall.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By the year 2000 it estimates that there will be a two per cent addition to GDP from savings. That is around $10 billion, which would make a substantial contribution to the general savings task, bearing in mind that the budget itself is coming back into a strong surplus from a deficit of around $12 billion&mdash;in the next couple of years we will come back into a surplus of around $7 billion.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian investment abroad increased from around 10 per cent of GDP in the early 1980s to peak at 31 per cent of GDP in September 1993. While this increase in overseas investment has been a welcome development reflecting the increasing internationalisation of the Australian economy, it contributed to higher levels of foreign debt as overseas borrowings were used to fund Australian equity investment abroad.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the House of the juxtaposition of those numbers&mdash;that is, our net foreign debt is 37 per cent of GDP and Australian investment abroad is 31 per cent of GDP. It was next to nothing in the early 1980s. In any analysis of our current account and debt position, Mr Speaker, you never hear about Australian assets abroad or the fact that, as a consequence of putting those assets abroad, our debt has risen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps a more compelling point is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked me a question about savings while he denies using any of the instruments of fiscal policy.

<PARA>In other words, those opposite are talking about the current account and savings while saying that they will not resort to any change in receipts, they will have long-term budgetary surpluses and they will deliver tax cuts to three groups&mdash;savers, families and self-funded retirees. As Mr Colebatch politely put it, this failure to reconcile is the key point about the opposition. There is no reconciliation between reality and the opposition's phobias. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition may well ask me what the answer is in relation to the current account deficit and the national debt, but one thing is for sure and that is that, whatever the answer is, he has not got a clue.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose there is always, every now and again, a little marker which marks out where the ground is in Australian public life. If there cannot be a marker on the importance of Japan to Australia and the fact that Australia is an island continent that trades into the Asia Pacific and is not a natural part of any trading bloc and is not looked after, as are countries in Europe or North America by the size and nature of their markets, I would have thought that the opposition would at least have the commonsense to know that something important here is being said in this declaration. Even if the opposition does not know or does not agree, let me underline to the Australian people how important it has been and is to Australia to build this relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration also went on to say how both of our governments reaffirm their strong support for the United States presence and strategic engagement in the Asia Pacific as being of fundamental importance to the peace and prosperity of the region. We do underline it and it is significant, important and fundamental to the peace and prosperity of the region. I think even members opposite would understand that without the strategic protection which the United States provides to Japan the strategic environment in North Asia would be nothing like as peaceful, passive or certain as it is today. Were that to change, the whole nature of the East Asian region would change; hence, the importance for Japan of resolving these trade differences with the United States so that in the eyes of the American people the standing of Japan does not diminish or suffer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was at pains a moment ago to make the point that, in terms of the change in the underlying savings equation in Australia, in terms of the budget balance coming back into surplus&mdash;heavily into surplus in the next few years&mdash;and in terms of the long run change to superannuation, and given that the Treasury said in its statement No. 2 text that the current account deficit had our debt stable at around 2 1/2 per cent of GDP but at around an average of 4 1/2 per cent it needed to be attended to in terms of savings, one understands that the size of the problem is roughly at around two per cent of GDP, or $10 billion in today's dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said a few moments ago that on superannuation alone the government's changes are worth about two per cent of GDP by the year 2000 and four per cent by the year 2020. But by the budget coming from a deficit of $12-odd billion back into surplus, rising to a surplus of $7 billion in the next couple of years, there is a very important change of somewhere between two per cent and four per cent of GDP from the budget&mdash;depending on whether one wants to disaggregate the cyclical and structural components of it. So there is two per cent to four per cent in the budget and two per cent on superannuation&mdash;somewhere between four per cent and six per cent to deal with a two percentage point problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that Mr Mercer would understand that arithmetic and at least would have read statement No. 2 to understand what is being done. I thought his remarks perhaps were given away by this reported remark:</PARA>

In preventive health measures there is an additional $85 million. A lot of that is going to anti-smoking initiatives and to the immunisation program. Again, I imagine that is welcomed by the opposition spokesperson. In the research area there is an additional $58 million, and in mental health some $13 million in particular initiatives for youth suicide.</PARA>

There have been various attempts to do it, but they have not succeeded. The opposition leader says that is because the policy is a secret since otherwise we would pinch it. I want to put paid to that. I have heard some signs of what the opposition is proposing, and I can assure it and the Australian people that we would not want to pinch it.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best news in the federal budget for Australia's retirees is the proposed change to the legislation which deems unrealised capital gains on unlisted shares and securities.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Financial Planning Association welcomes and strongly endorses the substantial reforms to the social security system brought down in this year's budget. `These reforms mark the biggest shake-up to the pensions income test in the last decade' said Mr Jock Rankin, chief executive of the Financial Planners Association. `It may well be the most significant set of changes to retirement incomes policies since the introduction of the assets test in 1983.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr TICKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the question from the shadow minister because it allows me to put on the record some very important facts concerning the declaration which I made to protect an area in South Australia which was the subject of a claim for Aboriginal heritage protection. At all times I have acted in this matter in good faith and strictly in accordance with legal advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to this matter is that I commissioned an independent Australian law professor, Professor Cheryl Saunders AO, to conduct an independent inquiry and prepare a report for me in accordance with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. Professor Saunders conducted that investigation. She heard and weighed up a wide range of views. In fact, she received some 400 separate representations. Her report is publicly available, and its conclusions about the significance of the Hindmarsh Island area to the Aboriginal women concerned are clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take members of the House briefly to the central finding of her report. I want members of the House to put themselves in the position that I as the federal minister was in when I received this report. I particularly direct my comments to members of this House who are believers, who profess&mdash;whether it be some Christian or some other faith&mdash;and I ask them what they would have done if they received this report. The report from Professor Saunders stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hindmarsh and Mundoo Islands and the waters surrounding them have a supreme spiritual and cultural significance for the Ngarrindjeri people within the knowledge of Ngarrindjeri women which concerns the life force itself.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what I as the responsible minister was told after having done everything I was required to do under federal legislation to commission that independent report. I rebut the myth that somehow or other my decision was based on secret information. I can categorically assure this House that that was never the case. In fact, my decision was based on the publicly available report of Professor Saunders and the representations that were made. It is true that there have been accusations in the media and now by the shadow minister in the parliament attempting to attack my bona fides and attempting to dispute the basis of the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer members of the House to what His Honour Mr Justice O'Loughlin said in a court case that found ultimately against me on a procedural ground. Let me tell the House what His Honour Mr Justice O'Loughlin said when there was a suggestion that I had pre-judged the matter in the way in which the member for Hindmarsh suggests.

<PARA>I remind the House that nowhere in that judgment has there been any criticism of my ethics, my integrity and the principles which I adopted in granting that declaration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development. Can the minister advise the House of the government's increased commitment to the better cities program outlined in the recent budget? Also, has the minister seen comments reported from Launceston last week concerning the better cities program? What is the minister's response to those comments?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Bass for her question. In the recent budget there was a further commitment to the better cities program of the order of $247 million. It was indicated that the priorities in relation to the further development of the better cities program would relate to, firstly, infrastructure, particularly access to ports, rail and so on; secondly, the issue of growth areas and the pressures that various growth areas in terms of Australian cities are facing; and, thirdly, the question of urban renewal and revitalisation. As Australian cities get older, there is more room to look at the potential for revitalisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition made a visit to Launceston last week. As the honourable member for Bass would point out, he was met with a considerable degree of enthusiasm about the better cities project in that city. It is a very important redevelopment of the Inveresk railway yards. It represents a revival of a central area of Launceston which is important to the city and which is located close to the river. It draws attention to one of the real positives in the city of Launceston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition made it clear that he would support better cities projects `where they were worth while'. What that indicates on the part of the Leader of the Opposition is, if you like, a case by case approach to policy. Effectively, the Leader of the Opposition is going to wander around Australia and when he sees something that is politically opportunistic for him to support, he is going to put his hand up and say, `That's worth while.' If on the grounds of political opportunism he decides otherwise, he is going to say, `No, we won't support that.' It would all be done simply on a case by case basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that the honourable member for Maranoa made it very clear&mdash;I thought officially on behalf of the opposition&mdash;that he did not support the continuation of the better cities program. Those who have an interest in the program and the particular locations it supports should take the views of the member for Maranoa. He believes that the fact that better cities mark I supported projects in cities like Bunbury, Launceston, Mackay, Townsville or Newcastle&mdash;cities that are certainly not within the metropolitan area&mdash;was representative of some kind of urban bias.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am seeking to make is that if you are expecting an ounce of policy from this opposition, forget it; if you are expecting the opposition to proceed in terms of any principle, forget it; and if you are expecting the opposition to take account of any real analysis of what is going on in this community, forget it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Is the Attorney-General aware of reports that the government's Racial Hatred Bill will result in an onerous suppression of freedom of speech? Can he inform the House if this is the case?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the government's introduction of its Racial Hatred Bill towards the end of last year, we have seen in the community, and certainly through the various columns of Australian newspapers, an active debate about the wisdom or otherwise of proceeding down the path of racial hatred legislation and the issues which flow from that. On the whole, that debate has been reasoned and well argued. There are, of course, differing views on whether this is the appropriate mechanism in order to attack the very serious problem of racial hatred and the violence which often flows from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the most recent contribution to this particular debate which has come from the opposition, particularly in the form of the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Vanstone, certainly does not fall into that particular category. In a pamphlet, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The old digger on his soapbox</EMPHASIS>, the shadow Attorney has put out a publication which, first of all, I think, generally tries to stereotype views in our ex-service community, which certainly are not accurate in terms of beliefs on racism, intolerance and bigotry. But, putting that to one side, it misrepresents and distorts completely the substance of the government's bill and attempts, in the crudest of forms, to scaremonger in relation to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same shadow Attorney-General who has had carriage of the opposition's policy in this matter&mdash;and this is one of the few matters where the opposition actually does have a stated policy. It has actually produced a document. I know it is a bit rare and people are a bit shocked by this, but this is actually a field where the opposition has produced a policy and put it out into the public domain. The reaction to it explains why the opposition generally does not have policies. We see, for instance, in today's newspapers comments&mdash;not only about the opposition's policy but specifically about this shabby little leaflet put out by Senator Vanstone&mdash;such as `Liberal paper angers ethnics', `Howard attacked over race issues', `Strife over racism pamphlet', `Anger at Liberal pamphlet'. That sums it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition having been chided by Australian ethnic communities in relation to this particular pamphlet, do we see any backing down? Do we see any apology coming from Senator Vanstone or the Leader of the Opposition? No. Rather, we see Senator Vanstone on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">11 AM</EMPHASIS> program on the 7 network this morning going on defending the pamphlet and saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe, if you want to express those deep seated feelings, even if it is hatred, and you want to encourage others to agree with you, you should be allowed to.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Vanstone said today. We have heard absolutely nothing from the Leader of the Opposition on this shabby little exercise. It is attributed to him in newspaper comments that he has not seen the leaflet but that he is sure Senator Vanstone would do the right thing. Well, Senator Vanstone has not done the right thing. The Leader of the Opposition should familiarise himself with this shabby little exercise and repudiate that particular publication and the sentiments expressed by Senator Vanstone today. If he does not, he stands condemned with her.</PARA>

The legislative amendments were actually brought in in December last year, so we have had some few months for the legislation to be operative.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very significant saving for Australians. It is not a saving to government; it means simply that ordinary Australian families pay less.

It is a matter of rebutting some scare tactics that have been developed, particularly by some of the pharmaceutical companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to ensure that the community generally is well informed about generic substitution, we are launching a communication strategy to build on that success, that eight per cent increase. The information will go to pharmacists, to doctors, and to consumers of large quantities of medication for various reasons. Money can be saved and should be saved. I would hope the opposition will support these measures which mean that, in this case, the consumers and others save the taxpayers considerable funds by very important services being delivered to the Australian community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of this House an astonishing story of an Australian family's 50-year long struggle to solve the mystery surrounding the death of a very brave, very courageous Australian airman during World War II. In the year when all Australians have been encouraged to take part in the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, one of my constituents is piecing together the final parts of a mystery that started on 5 June 1944, when a Royal Air Force Lancaster bomber was shot down over France. Ever since that tragic event Mr Newton Roberts of Bunbury, Western Australia has not known the final resting place of his brother Ken, who was the Australian pilot and captain of the Lancaster bomber inscribed `LL-783' and known as `Cinders of the Clouds'. His body was never found or formally identified. He was listed as missing in action. However, over the years the amazing story of flight lieutenant Kim Roberts' last bombing raid has emerged. Yet even now his brother Newton Roberts does not know where, or indeed if, his brother was buried.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1944, three months before he was killed in action at the age of 21, Kim Roberts was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, an immediate award as opposed to those decorated on the completion of a tour, usually 30 operations. On a bombing mission over Stuttgart his Lancaster was hit by enemy fire but he managed to manoeuvre his plane and shoot down the attacking enemy aircraft. The citation read:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pilot officer Roberts then completed his bombing run and afterwards flew the damaged aircraft to base. This officer and his airmen displayed commendable skill, courage and coolness.</PARA>
<PARA>On the night of D-Day, Kim Roberts and his English crew had bombed a bridge 175 kilometres west of Paris. He was heading back to base at Dunholme Lodge in England, where his Lancaster bomber, a veteran of some 29 successful bombing missions over Germany and Europe, was attacked while approaching the Cherbourg Peninsula by a German fighter. His plane was badly hit. Two of the crew parachuted to safety and are alive in England today, after spending the rest of the war as prisoners of war. Their plane crashed and burst into flames, killing all of the occupants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survivors, Jack Forrest and Reg De Viell, were contacted just three years ago, when researchers in France uncovered debris from the Lancaster bomber in a farmer's field in Normandy. For nearly 50 years they had wondered what had happened to their comrades and the destiny of their aircraft. Forrest and De Viell visited France, not expecting to find any trace of their Lancaster. It was with great emotion that they learnt of the fate of their aircraft, which had crashed in a flooded field. Numerous pieces of rusty aircraft frame and engine were found still lying in the field. With the assistance of the local French mayor and some journalists, Forrest and De Viell discovered the graves of four of their crew: Navigator/Pilot Officer J. Lott, Radio Operator Flight Sergeant J. Tucker, and two gunners, Flight Sergeant L. Williams and Flying Officer G. Wyand. They were able to establish that, seconds after they jumped from the plane, two other crewmen also jumped but died when their parachutes failed to open as the plane was too low. All the crew members' graves were found in two French military cemeteries, but there was no grave for the plane's skipper, Flight Lieutenant Kim Roberts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is far more to this mystery than an Australian pilot missing in action. This particular pilot just happened to be wearing a rather special keepsake around his neck. It was Hermann Goering's own Iron Cross medal and had been given to Flight Lieutenant Roberts by a neighbour in Bunbury, Western Australia. As members will know, Hermann Goering was a German flying ace during World War I and later became Adolf Hitler's second in command. He headed the feared German Luftwaffe during World War II. But during World War I Hermann Goering had shot down approximately 27 aircraft. The pilot of the seventh plane he brought down was a man called Frank Slee, who lived across the road from Kim Roberts' home in Stirling Street, Bunbury, Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before Kim Roberts left for overseas duties, Slee gave him the medal and told him to keep it as a memento. He said Goering had given him the Iron Cross as a memento of their dogfight, an incident described in Goering's biography published in 1950. After the battle, Goering simply landed his plane, walked up to Slee, shook his hand and gave him his own inscribed Iron Cross medal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kim Roberts did exactly what Slee had asked him. He kept the medal around his neck and never took it off. In fact, according to the two survivors, Forest and De Viell, the medal became a mascot for the crew and Kim Roberts would wave it around his neck to urge them on. Indeed, one theory of this amazing mystery is that after the Lancaster crashed, Kim Roberts may have been mistaken for a German because of the different colour of the Australian uniform and the fact that he was wearing the Iron Cross. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be that an Australian pilot who gave his life for his country was buried as a German and, for the last 50 years, this has been one of the doubts that Kim Roberts's family has had to live with. After years of painstaking research, they now know exactly where the plane went down. They know precisely what happened to everyone on the plane except the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Kim Roberts. Researchers are also considering the possibility that Kim Roberts was thrown from the plane on impact and his body is still laying beneath the mud in the farmer's field in Normandy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French have expressed considerable interest in this event and have provided considerable assistance to researchers. The local mayor has written to my constituent and taken part in a special ceremony with the two British survivors to mark the 50th anniversary of D-day. They have located a farmer who was only 15 years old at the time and who has told how he saw the crippled bomber flying at rooftop height. The farmer said that the pilot was still at the controls and was struggling to avoid nearby buildings, before ditching the plane in a field. He said that the plane finally crashed to the ground about 200 metres from his farmhouse and broke up, bursting into flames on impact. The tail section broke away from the cockpit and wings which, fed by the remaining fuel, became an inferno. Local villagers gathered around the wreckage of the tail section and noticed the two bodies inside. All four bodies were buried and later interred in local cemeteries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with many tragedies that occurred during the war, the events of 50 years ago are somewhat clouded in the memories of the people who experienced them. As time goes by, their memories fade, and that is precisely why part of the Australia Remembers program has focused on collecting and recording the eyewitness accounts before they are lost forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituent, Flight Lieutenant Kim Roberts's brother, has asked for government assistance to go to France and visit the place where his brother's plane went down and to place a memorial in the village church. I have passed on his wishes to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). I urge the minister to help the Roberts family to put the final pieces of this mystery together and to place a lasting reminder of Flight Lieutenant Kim Roberts's final bombing mission in France where his plane went down. In the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II and the year when Australia remembers all those who served their country, I urge the minister to offer every assistance to the Roberts family so that they can  complete the final chapter in this very unfinished mystery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak about the issue of gun ownership and gun control, which has received quite a deal of publicity lately, particularly with the recent spate of killings in Brisbane and other places. I, like any parent, naturally feel very sorry for the family of the teenager Matthew Easdale who was shot while breaking into a home in Brisbane, regardless of the circumstances. At the same time, I can understand the actions of the home owner in the situation in which he was placed. Needless to say, a young man has died because of some of the problems we have with gun ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what I cannot understand is the rash of impetuous and premature calls for the relaxation of the laws relating to gun ownership in Australia. The rationale amongst some groups seems to be that the only way to make society safer is to introduce more guns. I should think not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I can understand the actions of the home owners in the recent burglary case in Brisbane where someone was shot and tragically killed. I do not in any way condone the actions of the victims in these cases, who were after all breaking the law by attempting to enter the home of private citizens. I do not feel qualified to make a judgment one way or the other as to whether or not they deserved to die for what they were doing. As far as I am concerned, nobody is qualified to make that judgment, and certainly not the groups which called for more guns to be made available for citizens to use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is most disappointing is the fact that so many different groups have jumped on this bandwagon and used these tragic incidents to promote their own political agendas. To some extent, this has been encouraged by some, with governments using the law and order debate in election campaigns. This is certainly the case in Queensland, where the opposition has used it to try to score cheap political points on the government. The opposition knows that it cannot match the Labor government's policies. The Queensland National Party leader, Rob Borbidge, admitted as much last week when he said that the opposition would not release its policies to the voters. That is nothing unusual for us when dealing with the federal opposition. I wonder if those opposite have the same problem. Is that why we are not seeing any policies from the federal opposition?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central to this law and order debate is the issue of gun ownership. Since these tragic incidents, we have seen all sorts of people come out of the woodwork and use these shootings to justify their views on why guns should be more readily available in Australia. Most commonly, they quite shamelessly try to frighten ordinary Australians into believing that we are living in a lawless society with crime&mdash;particularly violent crime&mdash;increasing rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, figures show this attempt to be nothing more than scaremongering. They are preying on the fears&mdash;real or imagined&mdash;of citizens. Statistics show that there has been little or no increase in violent crime in Australia over the last decade. According to surveys by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, rates of more serious crimes have not risen in Queensland in recent years. For example, three per cent of respondents to such a survey in 1983 said that they had been assaulted. In a 1993 survey, this figure was unchanged. In the case of break and enter offences&mdash;which are most relevant to this matter&mdash;there was a slight rise from 5.8 per cent in 1983 to 7.5 per cent in 1993. Recent police figures from Queensland show that there was a 25 per cent increase in break and enters in 1994 from the previous year, but the overwhelming majority of these were not the so-called `home invasions', which has become a bit of a byword lately and an emotional one at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most break and enters still occur while the home owner is out, and the burglar's main objective is to steal property and get away undetected&mdash;not to harm defenceless people. Just the same, they need to be deterred. The issue of stiffer penalties for breaking and entering is another that may be debated some day. It is a matter of some debate at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most robbers are smart enough to commit their crime when the owner is out. I am not defending them&mdash;they should be punished with the full weight of the law, which they are when they are apprehended&mdash;but I just make the point that there is no evidence to support claims from some groups that we need increased gun ownership in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this will always be an emotive and controversial issue&mdash;anything that involves crime against personal property with the added risk of injury is a serious matter. I am appalled at the way many groups have come out and had a feeding frenzy with this issue. For example, we would all know of the continuing attempt over the years by the Australian Firearms Owners' Association to influence both public opinion and governments into making gun ownership easier in Australia. I am sure most members in this House would know that the government has not always seen eye to eye with the association on this issue. After its comments on Matthew Easdale's shooting, I do not think things will change much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ian McNiven, the association's vice-chairman, went on national radio and said that Easdale's death was an example of `the blood price' Australians have to pay to live in `a safer society'. Despite the fact that the figures I quoted illustrate that society is no more dangerous than it was, Mr McNiven was attempting to frighten people into thinking that society is increasingly lawless. But the most shocking thing was his reference to a `blood price'. The very notion that we should accept a young man's death as natural and normal is abhorrent. As I said before, Easdale had no business being where he was or doing what he was doing. The situations were extreme and they prompted extreme actions from the home owner. I would hate to think that Mr McNiven would sanction such action in every case, almost as if it were a standard procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truly frightening aspect of the gun lobby's agenda is the risk of extremist political groups taking advantage of easier gun ownership laws to make their point, as we have seen in the United States recently with the Oklahoma bombing and the Waco siege, involving the Branch Davidian sect. There are already enough extremist groups in this country to worry about without encouraging them to take up arms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> from 23 May illustrates the danger. Some far right wing groups have published and continue to publish material from American individuals who have been linked with the Michigan Militia, responsible for the Oklahoma bombing. A cursory glance at any of these publications is enough to satisfy any normal thinking individual that these people are considerably removed from the mainstream political debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, four editions of the magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, Stock &amp; Barrel </EMPHASIS>were banned in 1993 because they contained instructions on how to make bombs and how to convert semi-automatic guns into fully automatic machine guns. When the reporter from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> queried the publisher of the magazine about this, the publisher said that he was proud to defy the censors. He then want on to say that he did not support terrorism but could accept its use as a tactic if it was used in a positive way for Australia. Could anyone please explain to me how terrorism can be used in a positive way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is usually the case with such groups, conspiracy theories abound. They believe that the financial system is conspiring with the UN and other governments in order to form a single government and take over the world. As a result of this, they encourage their supporters to be prepared to take up arms and defend themselves against the coming takeover. You probably do not need to be told that they endorse a fundamentalist Christianity and they approve of a deep hatred and distrust of governments, banks, communism, Jews, Asians, Aboriginals and just about anyone else who does not fit in with their ideas of what is normal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason, I would not like to see an increase in the number of guns in Australia, nor do I think the gun ownership laws should be relaxed. It is too great a risk. I acknowledge that there will always be situations, like Matthew Easdale's death, that will test opinions on this issue. I am not saying that there will ever be a perfect world, because we know there will not be, but we do not need to let irrational fears rule us on this issue. In fact, I cannot think of anything that requires more reasoned thought and caution than this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hate to think that the Australia I grew up in will become like the United States, where guns are common and their use far too frequent. I only hope the people running around scaring us into thinking we need guns will one day wake up to the fact that they are lucky to live in a country that, most of the time, does not need them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by making some reference to the days before I came into the parliament when I worked in the banking industry and was involved in the banking union. I was also on the national standing committee on bank security. That was an area in which we worked very hard, through the union, trying to ensure that commonsense gun laws were consistent across this country. From that experience and from knowing a lot of unassuming bank employees who actually had the terrible experience of looking down the barrel of a gun during bank hold-ups, I can always grieve for the people I knew who were involved in those situations and understand how it affected their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia really needs to address our problems of law and order, which any country has at present, with a much more commonsense approach than these knee-jerk reactions of people demanding things like lesser gun laws rather than demanding tighter laws so that people do not have access to those sorts of weapons that can only harm our society. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to raise this issue today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this afternoon's grievance debate I wish to address two issues of fundamental importance to the future prosperity of Australia. Innovation and micro-economic reform are enabling Australia to confidently lead the way to freer trade in Asia. The leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is providing support for these fundamental changes and building a better future for Australia in cooperation with our region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Innovation is about making the best use of Australia's outstanding science and technology. Innovation leads to new opportunities and more and better jobs for young Australians. Micro-economic reform stimulates innovation. Together, innovation and micro-economic reform can create new industries and raise the level of Australia's environmentally sustainable production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the policies of the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), when he was in government, Australia was inward looking, protectionist and riddled with industrial strife. Micro-economic reform is about the work force and management working together to achieve and exceed best practice; it is not about block outs, secret ballots and denying the rights of workers to union representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition is known for his longstanding and inflexible opinions on industrial relations. They colour his view on Hilmer and competition policy. In question time today, in referring to Hilmer, the Leader of the Opposition called on the federal government to back the Western Australian government in a dispute over the awarding of a stevedoring contract to a non-unionised company. For the Leader of the Opposition, competition policy is not a matter of achieving better outcomes; it is simply about trampling on the hard won rights of working people. The Keating government has made significant progress in micro-economic reform and has achieved real benefits for industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Micro-economic reform is a key mechanism for improving the business operating environment. It is aimed at improving the way in which an economy uses its resources. Micro-economic reform involves removing unnecessary burdens on business and minimising the costs of business inputs. This Labor government has an enviable record of achievement in introducing reforms in areas such as tariffs and quotas, capital markets, aviation and telecommunications. With the removal of the two-airline policy we have seen improvements in the services provided and reductions in airfares. For example, average domestic fares at the end of 1993 were 24 per cent lower in real terms than prior to deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the deregulation of the telecommunications market, international rates for long-distance calls have fallen by more than 25 per cent in the past four years. Following reduced levels of protection from foreign competition, our exports of manufactures grew at an annual rate of 14.2 per cent from 1984 to 1992. The pressure for reform applied by the federal Labor government has initiated great increases in operating efficiency in areas such as electricity generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a direct result of a more open and deregulated sugar industry, CSR Ltd has been stimulated to develop the Ord River sugar industry and to re-establish its in-house research. Companies such as Goninan, a company in my electorate, are building export businesses on the cash flow of engineering maintenance contracts for the construction of locos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the major benefit of micro-economic reform is that Australia is now better positioned to achieve sustainable economic and employment growth without the inflationary strains of the late 1980s. The Keating government has accomplished yet another achievement with the recent agreement with the states and territories to implement a new national competition policy regime. This agreement will apply intense competitive pressure across all industry sectors. As a consequence, at all levels of government the fundamentals of competitiveness such as innovation, science and technology, and education and training will be examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the dynamic nature of the reform process means adjustment and that not all may benefit equally from the changes. That is why the government has made sure that continued pursuit of micro-economic reform is also consistent with the employment thrust of Working Nation. As a government we reject the Liberal Party's doctrinaire approach to reform that would ignore the values of Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition should listen to CRA's senior executive, David Karpin. Following an extensive three-year study, the Karpin report on leadership and management skills describes a lack of depth in Australian management. In particular, it was noted that, relative to other countries, managers in Australia are not as skilled in their functional expertise as the workers they manage are in theirs. This finding reinforces the importance of involving workers in the process of change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Micro-economic reform is not a process that can be imposed by government fiat, as the opposition imagines. Under the member for Bennelong, Australia would be returning to the industrial disputation of the Fraser-Howard era. This government wants all Australians, especially the disadvantaged and the long-term unemployed, to ultimately benefit from the changes brought about by the reform process. While micro-economic reform is fundamental to building an innovative culture in Australia, it is also fundamental to reaping the rewards of Australian creativity and invention and to putting the clever country into action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Results are being achieved. Australia's industrial research and development is growing faster than that of any other OECD country. In raising the profile of innovation, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, has opened up an important new front in public policy. Together with the minister and the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, I have been involved in wide community consultations to develop the forthcoming innovation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Innovation is the transformation of creative ideas into practical solutions. It is about new ways of adding value for customers, including through product development, service provision, marketing and management. Innovation, ultimately, is about the creation of wealth. Innovation is vital to success in the free and fair competitive business environment emerging in Australia. It will enable Australia to gain economic returns from our superior science and technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trade liberalisation and developments in Asia have opened up bigger markets for Australian industry. The accessibility of these markets increases the rewards for innovation, greater efficiency and productivity. Globalisation means that investment is more footloose and difficult to attract or hold onto&mdash;another challenge we face. To meet these challenges, the federal government is committed to continual reform, particularly the reform measures under the umbrella of a national competition policy. In doing so, the government is supporting those disadvantaged by the dynamic nature of adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would members of the opposition do if they gained government? Whilst we do not have their policies, we do know their prejudices. The Liberals want the burden of structural adjustment to be borne by working people; the Nationals want their constituents to be protected from any change. That is why there are no opposition policies on issues as fundamental as the Hilmer competition policy reforms. What is the opposition's record on tackling economic reform? In government, under Malcolm Fraser, it avoided every hard issue. Its policies caused double digit inflation, double digit interest rates and double digit unemployment. Its low wage policies simply led to low productivity growth and destroyed Australian competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people will not exchange the government's sound policies and record of achievement on innovation and micro-economic reform for the opposition's absence of policies and record of failure. The only historical record that we have on policy from the Leader of the Opposition is his support for the disastrous Fightback policy espoused by Dr Hewson during the last federal campaign. That included a commitment to a goods and services tax of 15 per cent; slashing government expenditure by over $10,000 million; a zero tariff policy as modified by the National Party in certain sectors; and, above all, the abolition of Medicare, except for health cardholders and pensioners. The opposition has a tradition of underestimating the intelligence of the Australian electorate. Prejudices and absence of policy are no substitute for sound economic policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In today's grievance debate I wish to raise my concern that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) failed in his duty to seek and consider the knowledge and opinions of all Ngarrindjeri women regarding secret women's business in his decision to ban the building of Hindmarsh Island bridge. Further, the minister, through his emissary, Professor Cheryl Saunders and others, failed to establish the bona fides of the women making the claims and the likelihood that they could be the custodians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has caused a severe set back to the process of reconciliation and cast suspicion over genuine claims. Let us consider the key women who say they do not believe the `women's business' to be true. Mrs Dulcie Wilson, aged 64, is a highly respected Ngarrindjeri elder who was born and brought up at Point McLeay&mdash;the home of the Ngarrindjeri tribe since the 1850s&mdash;and lived there until aged in her 80s. She was citizen of the year in her home town of Millicent, a former ATSIC councillor and so highly respected by the Salvation Army that she was asked to represent the women of Australia at Westminster in the 1950s. Her late husband, Lindsay, was a noted Ngarrindjeri historian and an authority on the customs and beliefs of his people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Dorothy Wilson, a 48-year-old grandmother, says that she was involved from the beginning, when on 6 May 1994 a group of 16 women first met at Goolwa and wrote to Minister Tickner asking him to stop the bridge. Dorothy Wilson was program director of the Murray Bridge Nunga's Club, which caters for the local Ngarrindjeri community, and she appears on a poster honouring Aboriginal achievers of Murray Bridge. In a statutory declaration she says, `My grandmother was a Ramindjeri woman and my grandfather was from the Yaraldi tribe,' both of whom camped seasonally on Hindmarsh Island. Mrs Wilson can genuinely lay claim to being a descendent of the tribes that camped on Hindmarsh Island. She spoke out because she could no longer live with the conspiracy that others sought to hide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is 74-year-old Ngarrindjeri elder, Mrs Bertha Gollan, who says that she could not risk going to her grave living a lie. She has been quoted as saying, `How can I lie to my daughters?' Born and brought up at Point McLeay, Mrs Gollan is the first to admit that her mother's tribe is from the south-east of South Australia and, therefore, could not possibly have known of this so-called `secret women's business'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast these women with those who claim knowledge of the women's business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories deals with the proposed restoration of the King George V memorial currently located in the parliamentary zone. The memorial commemorates King George V, the monarch at the time of the opening of the Old Parliament House. The memorial is classified by the National Trust and has been entered on the Register of the National Estate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 2 March 1995, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) wrote to the committee referring to it the proposed restoration of the memorial, including the removal of two Lombardy poplars which flank the memorial. The memorial consists of a central brick pylon faced with sandstone blocks. There is a 4.5 metre copper alloy statue of King George V facing east and a sandstone figure of St George on horseback facing west. Ten commemorative inscriptions are inscribed on the sandstone, at the base and high on the pylon, and nine copper alloy bas-relief plaques have been placed around the work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I looked at the memorial, I was interested to see some of the plaques and inscriptions. There are plaques of a flier, nurse, soldier and sailor commemorating World War I. Sir Henry Parkes is there and so is Sir Samuel Griffith, commemorating the first federal convention in 1891. The opening of the first federal parliament in 1901 is recalled by their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York. There is also the inscription commemorating the 26-year reign of King George V. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is aware that questions over the siting of the memorial and the ongoing need for repairs have dogged the memorial for over 50 years. The memorial was originally erected in 1943 on a large podium directly in front of the Old Parliament House. From that time, concern was raised about the location of the memorial. It was moved in 1968 to its present location to the west of the front of the Old Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On its present site, the memorial is surrounded by a granite paved area and the original large podium has been replaced by a smaller platform. The memorial is flanked by two mature Lombardy poplars. Public access to the memorial has not been possible since October 1991 because of the concern about public safety and continuing damage to the memorial. The root systems of the poplars have caused damage to paving surrounding the memorial, causing a tripping hazard. Fine roots have penetrated the stone work of the memorial's plinth and the location of the two Lombardy poplars restricts access to the memorial for maintenance work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on the evidence, the committee accepts that it is necessary to remove the Lombardy poplars, although the committee regrets that such a problem was not foreseen when the memorial was moved to its present location. In his letter to the committee, the minister said that the matter of the final location of the memorial is still undecided. The committee notes that the memorial has been on its present site for most of its existence and that the issue of a change in its location would be difficult to resolve. Therefore, it is the committee's recommendation that the King George V memorial remain permanently on its present site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed that the restoration of the memorial will be carried out by the National Capital Planning Authority. It is expected to take approximately four months at an estimated cost of $226,905. This amount includes tree removal and reinstatement of the area with new plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is concerned that the failure to carry out maintenance on the memorial since 1968 has contributed to the urgent need to undertake the work to restore the memorial before a decision could be made on the permanent location of the memorial. The committee recommends that the restoration of the memorial proceed and be completed to a standard commensurate with the permanent siting of the memorial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the committee members for their contribution to this inquiry. Committee members made a special effort to deal with the inquiry quickly in recognition that the much needed maintenance and restoration of the King George V memorial should be a priority to ensure that it is not allowed to deteriorate further.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By resolution of the House of 11 May 1995, the Speaker was given the authority to release the report of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure into the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and the Air Services Bill 1995 if the House was not sitting when the report was presented to him. Under this authority the report was released on 18 May 1995. Use of this procedure reflects the tight deadline under which the committee operated and the need to give the government sufficient time to introduce amendments to the bills during this second reading debate in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is the outcome of a reference given to the committee on 28 March 1995 by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). Given the importance of the bills and the need to establish the two new aviation authorities by 1 July 1995, the committee moved quickly. On 30 and 31 March the bills and their explanatory memoranda were sent to organisations which were asked to make submissions by 20 April 1995. Evidence was taken at a public hearing on 26 April. Report consideration commenced on 10 May, and the amended report was accepted by the committee the next day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the many people and organisations who assisted the committee to meet this tight deadline. Secondly, I thank the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff for the quick turnaround of the transcript of 26 April 1995. Thirdly, I thank the Australian Government Publishing Service for the speedy printing of the report. Lastly, I give special thanks to the members who made themselves available for the public hearing and who assisted in the report preparation. They were the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) and the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne). I particularly thank the committee secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the report. We say it has three objectives: first, to comment on whether the bills are necessary; second, given the first point, to examine whether the bills meet their basic purposes; and, third, to advise the House on the need for amendments that would improve the quality of the bills, including advice on the second point. In examining the need for the two bills the committee drew the following conclusion: there is broad support for the establishment of an independent aviation safety authority. The committee endorses this approach. The creation of a new authority with a new and more specialised board and a new director is a far better solution for the troubled and turbulent world of aviation safety regulation in Australia than any reorganisation within the existing Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recognised the limits of the legislation. We said that the establishment of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, or CASA, by itself is not the only cure of the problems that have beset the administration of aviation safety in Australia. At the end of the day, it is the board of CASA and its director that must be responsible for the administration of aviation. The key issue then is accountability. We emphasise that CASA should be accountable to the minister, the parliament and the courts and to no-one else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining two report objectives are combined in the two chapters that examine separately each of the bills. The experience gained by the committee in the aviation safety inquiry lead it to emphasise the need for clarity in the bill that establishes CASA. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill should set out clearly, precisely and comprehensively the functions of the aviation safety regulator, CASA. Then the regulator, the aviation industry and others would know what is the job of CASA. Clearly prescribed functions would also enable the Parliament to gauge the effectiveness of CASA.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, this clarity is absent in the bill. We welcomed the innovation of an object clause but found confusion between object and functions. The two words were used interchangeably and there was duplication and, in our opinion, too much detail in the object clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view of the committee was that clarity would be promoted and confusion reduced if the object clause is a broad in-principle statement of purpose. Then the more detailed functions of the object clause could be transferred to the section on functions. Paragraph 3.12 of the report sets out the committee version of the object clause. We want a short in-principle statement of purpose along the lines set out in the paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to functions, the next key feature of the bill. Once again with clarity in mind, the committee said that, rather than a simple listing, functions should have a three tier classification. Functions should be classified according to whether they are, first, primary or core functions; secondly, functions related to those primary or core functions; and, thirdly, other functions. The report makes several recommendations on functions. Once again, the committee is not wedded to the detail. We are, however, convinced of the need to bring all the functions into the one place, of the necessity to classify functions and of the need to avoid duplication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned the need for accountability. Two aspects of the bill concern the committee. The first is paragraph 3A(g) of the object clause, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . promoting the highest possible levels of accountability within CASA and for CASA's dealings with other bodies . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The committee has several concerns about this paragraph. The most serious is that of regulatory capture. This would happen if CASA, the regulator, is seen to be accountable to the industry, the regulated. Our recommendation is that paragraph 3A(g) be either deleted or redrafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern covers the corporate plan. Briefly, we believe that the corporate plan that the minister approves should be tabled in both houses with expedition. This covers both the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Air Services Australia. Several other aspects of the report will be covered by our inquiry into aviation safety. I again thank my colleagues and the secretariat for their assistance in this rapid task we undertook. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By going through the legislation we were able to identify a number of shortcomings in it&mdash;shortcomings in our view and indeed in the view of others from the industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also make the point that one aspect of the bill which was not drawn to our attention but has since been drawn to our attention&mdash;I have not discussed this with the chairman&mdash;relates to clauses 20A and 20B of the legislation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is being referred now. Clauses 20A and 20B of the legislation amend the old legislation to read that a pilot may be breaking the law if he flies an aircraft in a fashion where it has the potential to endanger life or property. Taking the ridiculous circumstance, just getting in an aircraft and flying has the potential to endanger life or property. That rather ambiguous statement in the legislation needs to be corrected. As the honourable member for Shortland interjected a few moments ago, that is now being reported to the minister, and hopefully amendment to the legislation will take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been an extremely worthwhile process which other committees of the parliament and other ministers responsible for the passage of legislation in this parliament would be wise to undertake. Members of our committee also want to ensure that this is not the last time we see amendments to civil aviation legislation before this House. Obviously, as we draw to a conclusion our report and we make recommendations, we would like to think that the opportunity to amend this legislation further would be available to us to ensure that deliberations which we have been undertaking now for a very long time can bear some fruit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with the member for Shortland in thanking those people who participated on this committee, particularly the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne), who is at the table, and the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1995-96. As the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said in the lead-up to the budget, a number of important issues need to be addressed. The first issue was to accelerate the process of the deficit reduction strategies that had been outlined last year. The next issue was to ensure that we provided a comprehensive medium-term strategy to boost national savings. Underlying all of those things was the test of ensuring that we made a real contribution to dealing with the major challenge of the current account deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his response to the budget, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said that there were a number of tests to determine what should be done in the budget. Unfortunately, obviously one of the tests that did not apply to the Leader of the Opposition was to actually outline any policy. It was very clear from listening to his response to the budget that he still has not developed any policy that he is prepared to put before the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was reinforced in the speech made at the press club by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). The only thing he proposed at that stage that was of any note was the commission of audit that will be reporting on contingent liabilities of the Commonwealth, including public service superannuation, et cetera. The only thing we can say about the commission of audit is that it is the alibi for the slash and burn tactics that the opposition is hoping to get away with after the next election rather than outlining any detailed policies and taking the people of Australia into its confidence prior to the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing about this year's budget is that it achieves the objectives we set. First of all, we get the budget back into surplus this year. The structural position of the budget will improve dramatically in 1996-97. In 1996-97, even leaving aside the asset sales that are outlined in this year's budget, there will be a surplus of $3.4 billion. The budget surplus this year has been achieved through a combination of fiscal tightening, revenue measures and asset sales; that is, looking at all the elements that go to make up the budget quite properly and trying to ensure that we take steps to maintain a sustainable level of economic growth. The budget forecast, which no-one has challenged this year, of around 3 3/4 per cent is a very achievable target. Indeed, the Secretary to the Treasury said recently that he believed that target could be exceeded through sustainable, low inflationary growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other key tenets of what policy has to be about is ensuring that we maintain the benefits of the low inflationary environment which have been one of the major achievements of recent years and which are clearly part of our future competitiveness. It must be built on maintenance of low inflation and growth and it must be built on productivity but with inflation being kept at realistically low levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important consideration in sustaining the recovery is to ensure that interest rates are kept at the lowest levels possible. Since the budget we have seen some of those interest rates&mdash;both the variable home loan rates and the fixed home loan rates&mdash;starting to come down. Certainly, there has been a stabilisation of interest rates through this year. Again, we can see the right ingredients to have sustainable economic recovery now and to build stronger economic fundamentals in the economy in the years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key initiatives in this year's budget relates to our plan for national savings. The cornerstone of that plan relates to superannuation. As everyone would be aware, up until now the government had outlined a strategy on superannuation to ensure that we achieved a nine per cent employer contribution by the year 2002. The measures announced in the budget ensure that, in addition to that nine per cent, we will now have a three per cent employee contribution and a matching three per cent contribution from the government. So, effectively, what we will have from the year 2000 onwards is a situation where the vast majority of workers will have a 15 per cent retirement income superannuation component. This will help to ensure higher retirement incomes for them as individuals but it will also dramatically add to national savings which the whole nation benefits from in the future. That is the key element in ensuring that we mount the proper attack on our current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that superannuation savings today total just under $190 billion. The initiatives that have been outlined in the budget will provide a massive boost to superannuation savings and will ensure that we meet the challenges of national savings and of the ageing of the population. It will therefore ensure a higher quality of life for all Australians into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's response has basically been to say, `We believe there should be tax breaks of some description for private savings rather than the regime that has been outlined by the government.' A few things should be noted here. First of all, the tax concessions already in the system for superannuation amount to about $5 billion. We also know that providing a tax break just for private savings will ensure the sort of situation we had prior to 1983. When the vast majority of people did not get access to superannuation, they became totally reliant on the age pension. The benefits for taxation breaks on superannuation essentially pointed to those on higher incomes and people on lower incomes missed out. That group that missed out certainly included part-time workers and it inevitably included women, who have missed out on superannuation until recent times. They did not add to national savings either. All they did was shift the tax arrangements from the public saving to the private saving for a select few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe superannuation should be much more than an initiative for a privileged few. There should be superannuation arrangements that benefit the whole community. Today we have superannuation coverage of almost 90 per cent of the work force, whereas when Labor came into power in 1983 there was superannuation coverage of less than 45 per of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of studies have been done recently in this area. I refer in particular to the OECD report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxation on household savings</EMPHASIS>. It confirmed that the approach we were taking in the superannuation area was building national savings very considerably and was a preferred model in ensuring that household and national savings were improved as opposed to the tax break model that had been pursued by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something else worth noting when we discuss superannuation is the criticism from the opposition that the budget measures are there to somehow benefit the unions and industry funds. There are a number of things that need to be said about the employee contribution outlined in the budget papers. The plan is to, in the future, have employee superannuation contributions paid out of wage rises negotiated through award arrangements and enterprise agreements. The contributions will amount to three per cent in the three-year phase in period. This is important because it ensures that they are built up in a way that does not undermine industrial relations and household incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also just as important to note that the arrangements are not inflexible, as has been suggested. The arrangements will ensure that contributions from the self-employed are paid into complying superannuation funds as part of their tax returns. The arrangements are not just there for the benefit of those in some industries and some unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that payments can only be made into industry funds is quite wrong. The fact is that an employee's contributions will be paid into the fund that their employer uses for superannuation guarantee contributions. It is logical to pay the funds into the existing fund that the employee has. This will ensure that it is cheaper and easier for employers. In addition, it ensures that we build up the savings of each person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would obviously be foolhardy to encourage a situation where the superannuation contribution has to be paid into a new fund because it would not accumulate as quickly for the person making the contribution. The funds will be paid into whichever fund is receiving the superannuation guarantee payment. That will include industry funds, employer sponsored funds, master trusts and personal superannuation products. All of those funds can be appropriately structured to receive those superannuation guarantee payments. Absolutely no change will be made in that regard under the arrangements the government has outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been a suggestion from the opposition that the answer to all these issues is to have superannuation savings accounts and that somehow they will provide a different way of boosting national savings. I will make a couple of points in that regard. There is no doubt that some of the funds will flow into superannuation products provided by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions. Banks and credit unions have been very successful for some time in selling superannuation over the counter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the subsidiaries accounted for nearly a third of all personal superannuation premiums. Subsidiaries of banks and credit unions account for 35 of the 157 approved trustees able to sell public offer superannuation. There is a competitive environment in this area. The government says quite strongly that the same supervisory rules should apply to all superannuation funds. That is a prudentially sound thing to encourage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important budget initiative this year in the area of national savings was the government's conscious decision to make superannuation the main form of national savings by reorienting the second tranche of tax cuts proposed in the One Nation statement to ensure that they boost the retirement incomes and superannuation savings of individuals and ensure that the people who get the benefit of that particular form of national saving are those on lower to middle incomes. We have a situation where the real benefit of the initiative the government has taken will go to every worker who has an income up to one to four times average weekly earnings. They will phase out at twice average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefit of the $4.5 billion per annum that the government will pay into individual superannuation accounts by the year 2002 will go to those people in the lower to middle income sector. They will get a real benefit out of the government matching the contribution. This measure will ensure a strong level of equity in the way the payment is paid. In my view, this is certainly preferable to the proposal that would have involved the second tranche of tax cuts going to the upper income sector. This would have been without the boost to national saving which would have been attached to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very pleasing to note in the commentary on the budget that there has been a very strong endorsement of the government's proposals in the area of savings. The author of the previous report on national savings, Dr FitzGerald, made it clear that he thought this was a very positive step towards reaching the 18 per cent target that he believes is important for the future of superannuation savings for all Australians. Under these measures, we are ensuring that we achieve 15 per cent by the year 2002. Various others who have spoken and written about the budget initiative relating to superannuation have made clear that they strongly support the initiatives that have been taken in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that is important to note about this year's budget is the number of initiatives the government has taken to ensure we achieve the budget surplus which I think we all regard as important to achieve in future years. The government will do it in a way that will maintain the strong social justice credentials of the government. The initiatives in the health area are designed to protect and ensure the strength of our public health system and particularly relate to families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maternity allowance and a whole range of other changes outlined this year will provide sustainable incomes for families. They are important long-term measures which need to be built into the budget process in future years. There are initiatives in this year's budget that enforce the government's commitment to families. I will not run through all of those at this stage, but I point out that when people talk about family policy there is no doubt areas like Medicare are fundamental to the security of families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget ensures that we have a safety net in terms of pension payments for the aged. It is important that there are measures that ensure access to justice for all because that is an important consideration for all families. In relation to children, measures like the national child immunisation program are very tangible benefits and positive ingredients for ensuring family policy is properly maintained in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of important initiatives in this budget relating to the environment. The budget provides $252 million over four years for environmental initiatives. These relate to a number of key areas such as greenhouse, core environmental functions, biodiversity, wetlands, coastal policy, forestry and waste paper recycling programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key initiatives relates to coastal policy. Yesterday, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) launched a major initiative in the area of coastal policy. That is something that I think the whole community should regard as important. The preservation of our natural areas and the future enjoyment of our beautiful coastline concerns all those who are increasingly worried about the damage being done to our coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of environmental policy, the key initiative in this year's budget relates to the better cities program. The opposition has at times criticised this program. There are a number of important things that need to be said when we look at the better cities program. It is fundamentally designed to improve infrastructure, to look at the built environment and improve the quality of that built environment and to ensure that we have better public transport infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also designed to build economic efficiency. Obviously, if we have the right infrastructure in our cities and around our port, railway and freight networks the community as a whole benefits. There would be economic gain with regard to the investment in that infrastructure which the opposition has been far too quick to decry by criticising the better cities program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in particular the commitment to heritage in our cities. The built environment is an important area of consideration. Coming from Sydney and the electorate of Parramatta, which is the second oldest European settlement in Australia, I am very concerned to protect quality of life in our cities and to ensure that the major heritage items listed on the National Estate, which cities like mine and others around Australia have, are preserved and protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has a range of programs across better cities&mdash;areas relating to the national estate program through the environment portfolio and areas relating to tourism&mdash;all focused on trying to ensure that we protect those key elements of our national estate, those parts of the built environment that will be important not only for this generation but also for future generations. All those measures are picked up in a budget to provide the ingredients we need to ensure that the natural environment and the built environment are given the right priority but, at the same time, ensuring that is done in a way that maintains the key economic fundamentals that are crucial in this year's budget&mdash;and they, of course, relate to ensuring that we achieve the budget surplus, ensuring that we have the structural surplus there for future years and ensuring, as a result of that, that interest rates can be kept at low levels and that, as a result of those measures, economic activity can grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on a couple of other issues relating to the appropriations. The first issue relates to the opposition constantly claiming, as it does, that there is a lack of commitment to micro-economic reform by the government and the fact that it does not put enough energy into that area. Of course, not long before the budget, we did have the important initiatives relating to the Hilmer report. The national competition policy was launched. Eventually it received the right priority from the states, who were difficult to drag along and had to be bought in that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as a result of that, we do now have real commitments to national competition policy&mdash;a real commitment across all levels of government to work to achieve the economic efficiency that not only is important to Australia but also will be important to future generations of Australians because, through this, we ensure that we do have a national identity and we do have international competitiveness. This budget is all about building on that competitiveness, ensuring that we have sustainable economic growth for the future, ensuring that we have national savings built to the right levels&mdash;national savings that are genuine and long-term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time for the opposition to come forward and state clearly what it will do about national savings, rather than saying it will freeze everything and just give a tax break to a few. It has to be concerned, I suggest, to focus on national savings, to build on the strong superannuation initiatives we have taken, rather than continually knock and decry those initiatives which are in the long-term interests of all Australians. I commend the budget to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, if you want to tell a city, `So what?', then you have to expect a reply. When that reply comes and it sets a 60-year record, and it is so loud and clear, and then the people of Canberra are told they are just out of sorts, you have to begin to wonder whether or not 300,000 Australians, including the 99,000 voters in my electorate, and their children really exist in the eyes of Paul Keating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the truth be known, the people of the electorate of Canberra and, indeed, all the residents of the Australian Capital Territory&mdash;all 300,000 of them&mdash;are often overlooked in statements made in our national press that attribute government decisions, Labor government decisions, to the people of Canberra. How often have we heard the lines, `Canberra's new tax', `Canberra decided tonight', `Canberra has resolved', `Canberra hasn't delivered again'. Throughout the by-election when doorknocking from the suburbs of Curtin to Chisholm, Rivett to Isabella Plains, one constant plea from all in my electorate was that the national press in the press gallery attribute to the Labor government its mistakes and not blame the 300,000 mainstream Australians who live in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible that, because of this preoccupation with Canberra as the political heart of Australia, many Australians do not realise that the people of the electorate of Canberra are involved in the other facets of life that make Canberra the jewel in the crown of Australian life. Indeed, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Personal Investment</EMPHASIS> magazine recently chose Canberra as Australia's best city. And while many would say that Canberra has too much, I say that it sets a standard for all Australian society as a whole&mdash;through being the political, the diplomatic and the administrative heart of Australia; through being the defence, the research and the educational heart of Australia; through being the cultural heart of Australia; through being a tourism, technological and sporting heart; and through being a regional heart for the people of the south-east region of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are at it, let us dispel a few myths about Canberra. Like the rest of mainstream Australia, the electorate of Canberra and, indeed, all of the ACT is suffering the turmoils of unemployment, business and personal bankruptcy, family breakdown and social problems. For example, youth unemployment in the electorate of Canberra is 25 per cent worse than the Australian average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, that which is our home is your national capital. The people of Canberra do include political workers, diplomats and their staff, and a large number of public servants&mdash;public servants whom I have worked with and whom I respect and who, in the main, would simply like to serve the people of Australia at the direction of elected governments. They wish to serve in a non-political yet efficient and effective manner, for many of these public servants have seen the waste and are as unhappy as are other Australians at the excesses of governments such as this one. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Canberra is a research heart for this nation with constituents from my electorate working in the national capital's four universities.

Much research work carried out by the CSIRO is conducted here in Canberra. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most significantly, as a cultural heart, many of our country's most important collections are housed in Canberra. They are maintained and catalogued, researched and loved by the people of my electorate. Many of these collections have suffered the erosion of budget, of direction and of broken promises. For example, one of our greatest treasures is the collections of the National Museum of Australia. They include extensive collections relating to indigenous Australians which remain without a permanent exhibition building and without funding. Here is a promise from the coalition: the National Museum of Australia will be built at Yarramundi by the year 2000 because, unlike those who sit across from me, the coalition is not embarrassed to display the collections that represent mainstream Australia. </PARA>

These include collections from my old workplace&mdash;and I see some staff up there&mdash;the National Library of Australia.

It also has the best Australian bookshop in the world. But what does it not have?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Canberra as an electorate and as a city is also the heart of the Canberra region. Indeed, this week celebrates Canberra Region Week. It is a region that&mdash;if you live here you know&mdash;sweeps down to the magnificent beaches of the south coast, south and west to the magnificent high country of the main range, and north to Australia's fine wool and wheat country. Canberra gives these people an educational centre, a medical centre and an employment centre as well as a sporting, shopping and professional centre but, most importantly, a centre for opportunity. The south-east region gives Canberra back much in exchange. Undeniably, the electorate of Canberra is a reflection of Australian society, boasting the most diverse array of cultural heritages. Yet, with so much to offer, Canberra as a city is so often forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Australia itself, Canberra suffers from a tyranny of distance. Seen as isolated from the rest of the country, Canberra does not have an international airport, while poor rail links and yet-to-be-completed sections of highway isolate it. Yet in this budget session we see the selling of our nation's assets for no gain.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues that now challenge Canberra as an electorate and as a city also challenge Australia as a nation. The solutions for the nation are the solutions for Canberra. Many Australians, and indeed many Canberrans, feel forgotten.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to extend my congratulations to ACT Chief Minister Kate Carnell and to Deputy Chief Minister Tony De Domenico who have adopted the attitude that Canberra is open for business. Indeed, it is the businesses&mdash;large and small, corporate and family&mdash;that will employ, that will create wealth, that will increase savings, that will help build infrastructure and that will allow all Australians and the people of the electorate of Canberra a better future. These businesses deserve a better tax system with smaller compliance costs. They need a more flexible industrial relations system that will encourage small business not just to prosper but also to employ. They want less red tape and changes to the capital gains tax to provide relief for small businesses and they have to have a healthy climate providing certainty for business investment.

When one looks through this budget, the many and varied benefits it offers the Australian community are only too obvious. </PARA>

But the budget's most striking feature is its efficiency in disbursing public money in the most equitable and fairest manner possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the whole process surrounding this budget and its lead-up makes for a very busy time. Amid the flurry of activity&mdash;where words like `trade-off', `leaks' and `bids' and all sorts of economic jargon were commonplace&mdash;there may be a tendency for the public at large to overlook what the budget is really about. The budget is one part of the whole process of government and represents a major economic, social and political statement encompassing just about all government policy that can be expressed in money terms. Realistically, budgets are about jobs, markets, prices, quality of life and, above all, people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our government knows that it cannot please everyone. Commentators from academia, the media and the opposition will invariably level some sort of criticism. This year we have received flak for delivering a so-called election budget. But surely we must acknowledge that governments do not work in political vacuums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our federal Labor government has concentrated on enhancing the quality of life for Australians. It has sought to create jobs, to improve living standards and to increase financial assistance for families, especially those on low incomes. The government has also addressed the problems associated with an ageing population.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As a fluid and ongoing document and process, this budget simply continues that framework. In the area of social security, for example, we examine demographic trends, the changing nature of work and the much greater degree of variability and flexibility in people's family structures, care roles and life patterns, making judgments about when and where people most need assistance. Take the case of families. Presently, in designing assistance for a broad range of families, we attempt to judge when people will require help. One such example is the additional family payment&mdash;or AFP as it is referred to&mdash;which is paid in accordance with a rate schedule that varies with the age of the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have endeavoured to be innovative and flexible. One very worthwhile social security initiative introduced last year is the payment facility for unemployed people. This takes the form of an advance on their entitlement which they might use perhaps to purchase something needed in order to assist them to find work. Feedback about this measure shows that it has been overwhelmingly successful. </PARA>

This year's budget contains a whole host of measures that are bound to have positive effects in my electorate and will be significant in meeting not only the needs of the Prospect community with its high proportion of aged pensioners, recipients of DSS payments and large multicultural population but also the demands and needs of Australia in general. In my electorate, for instance, many social security reforms will make payments more responsive and targeted to customers' needs and will improve service delivery and payment arrangements for families and pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Integrating the basic family payment and the additional family payment into one single payment and combining the assessment and review processes for family payment and child-care assistance will streamline payment applications. These sorts of changes are particularly important in an electorate&mdash;again, I emphasise&mdash;such as mine which has a high number of families with young children. I might elaborate for the House that, according to the 1991 census, of the 50 New South Wales seats, only 11 have more young residents aged five and under than my electorate. Some 24.9 per cent of the residents in my electorate are aged between zero and 14 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The jobsearch allowance and newstart allowance will now be merged into one payment. It is a logical move. It is also logical to provide pensioners with quick access to money for emergencies via an advance of up to $500 on their pensions. The maternity allowance for new mothers will have significance for those women who are presently in the work force but whose places of work do not allow for maternity allowance provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with providing commonsense policies and programs, the government has got it right in getting financial assistance to those who really need it. Make no mistake, that result does not just happen out of the blue. It is the product of careful government analysis and careful government planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the centrepiece of this year's budget is the government's two-part plan to increase national savings. It will have a substantial long-term positive effect on our nation. I am referring of course to the provision of Australia's first genuine long-term private savings program through employee superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comparing the government's moves to promote savings with anything the Liberal coalition would implement is, in itself, an interesting exercise. On 16 May in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, journalist Laurie Oakes said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the budget shows the government is addressing the key issue [of savings], the opposition under John Howard is off on another track; the tax track. Howard's promised family tax package, for example, will not be easy to structure in a way that slots responsibly into an effort to increase national savings. It is, in a sense, irrelevant to the main game and an impediment to it.</PARA>
<PARA>I have no doubt that the budget's superannuation savings initiative will be well received everywhere. Again, my area is no exception. The three per cent superannuation levy is to apply to all workers with salaries up to $46,000 per annum. Many people in my area will qualify to receive a matching payment of up to $1,000 from the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moves in the superannuation area recognise Australia's fast growing pool of temporary and casual workers and the radical changes experienced in the employment market. Moreover, this plan can be viewed as one which is addressing problems and disadvantages faced by many women who take low paid casual jobs which allow them to fit in with their family commitments but which do not offer the benefits of full-time work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate has a high number of women workers in that category. CES figures reveal that the majority of women in my electorate are either part-time or casual workers and that the growth in jobs is in the service sector, which employs predominantly part-time and casual women workers. These people will be eligible to receive a matching contribution from the government that is more than three per cent of their own salary. All of these women earn less than average weekly earnings. So, if a person contributes more than three per cent of salary, it will be matched by the government up to that level of three per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the representative of a very multicultural electorate, I appreciate and applaud the government's campaign to encourage employers to check work rights and immigration status of prospective employees. Currently, up to 64 per cent of people overstaying their Australian visas are working illegally. This employment awareness campaign run by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs since 1991 has been very successful. A survey last year of employers found that more than 90 per cent wanted continued federal government assistance in identifying illegal workers. The federal budget has allocated $709,000 to continue the campaign during 1995-96. It is my personal belief that available jobs in our country must go to the people who are entitled to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another group that the government has addressed. It is a group that we tend to overlook: the carers&mdash;the unpaid workers, the unsung heroes, and there are many of them out there. I never cease to be amazed by the high level of unpaid work carried out every day in our communities by people who devote their time to caring for others. I offer them my heartfelt praise. It is difficult to gain accurate figures on the number of carers because it is an area where people have just got on with it and have not been particularly vocal in seeking help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enormous contribution made by the carers to the community will now be recognised under the number of budget changes to be implemented. I am proud to say that these include the removal of the requirement that carers live in the same or adjacent home of a care recipient to be eligible for carer pension. This will apply from July 1996. As well, from March 1996, eligibility for carer pension will be extended to include carers of people who, while they may not be pensioners themselves, are also not wealthy and hence cannot afford to pay for a carer. Up until now, only people who have been caring for a pensioner or beneficiary have been eligible for a carer pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with the direct financial benefits to carers, some $10 million has been earmarked in this budget for the carers' support strategy with some funds enabling state carers associations to provide counselling, information kits and assistance to individual carers. Included in the budget are funds to develop information for carers from non-English speaking backgrounds. That the government is to undertake a thorough review of existing programs and policies in caring illustrates that it is serious about addressing problems associated with the aged and people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our rapidly changing society, few individuals and families remain untouched by workplace change. We are all familiar throughout the developed world with changes brought about by structural and technological innovations. Recognising these problems, the government has sought to integrate employment, education and training; create job opportunities; and, through training initiatives, improve work force skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see in the budget that funding for higher education has been increased. From 1983 it has gone from $3 billion to over $5 billion in 1996, representing an increase of over 65 per cent. Since 1983 student numbers have increased by over 70 per cent to some 600,000 finishing year 12. The government has made a substantial investment in universities and TAFE colleges because it acknowledges their role in the intellectual, economic and social development of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, this budget is about fairness and equity. In that vain, Austudy will no longer be paid to the residents who choose not to become Australian citizens. Eligibility will be tightened to ensure that it is paid to families most in need. This will ensure that some families will have to provide more evidence of their need for government assistance for their student children. The key element is all about creating a system that recognises human diversity and the need for choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask: does the coalition really understand what being in government is about? It is not just a series of well laid out simple tasks. We operate in a fluid framework. We operate according to current social requirements and demands, but we do not take the easy and soft options mooted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) such as cutting taxes. Placed in the government's position, would the opposition have chosen cutbacks in services that help the poor while opposing tax rises that affect the rich? The short answer is that we do not know what the opposition would do. What do we use as a guide? Is it its proposal to cut $180,000 from the jobstart allowance by tightening the activity test and hence throwing thousands of people off onto welfare agencies, or is it its plan to reduce the age of a child for which a parent can be eligible for the sole parent pension depriving needy parents of that pension? Are comments from the coalition's industrial relations spokesman supporting harsh policies for workers that would leave them to fend for themselves an indication of coalition policies? We do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where the Keating Labor government has it all over the opposition. We have been prepared to tackle the more sophisticated and difficult issues. We have grappled with the new issues such as Mabo and Aboriginal land rights and the need to redefine Commonwealth-state relationships. I am proud to be part of a government which places such emphasis on providing high quality services to such a wide spectrum of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also announced in the budget that an allocation of some $762 million would be provided for the new Sydney West airport's development and associated transport infrastructure, which would include funds to cover further acquisition of the airport site and noise affected properties, upgrading local access roads and preliminary design work, airport development costs, state of the art CAA facilities and road construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly the overall development of Badgerys Creek site in 1986 following a very thorough study was entered into with a high degree of community involvement. This and the supplement to the draft environmental impact study was made publicly available in December of 1985 and had been the product of public consultation and involvement. As well, the final EIS was assessed by the relevant Commonwealth and state environmental agencies and endorsed by them as being adequate. I say: that was then and this is now&mdash;1995. That is why since my election to federal parliament in 1990 I have constantly urged our federal government to re-examine and update the issues outlined in the 1985 environment statement. I will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After wide ranging representations I recently met with the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and informed him of my residents' concerns. I am keen to ensure that our government's decision in this critical and sensitive area takes full account of the views, concerns and expectations of my constituents. I therefore welcome the federal government's decision that additional environmental assessments be carried out to supplement the 1985 EIS for Badgery's Creek. I welcome the move that new environmental management plans are to be prepared for both the construction and operation of the new airport, at a cost of some $23 million. Supplementary studies will involve the preparation of aircraft noise contours and air and water quality monitoring programs to ensure that residents of the area are protected from the airport's impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This 1995 budget commits $350 million for additional land acquisition, planning and construction to Sydney west. This is in addition to the $152 million already spent on airport site acquisition, and a further $250 million will be made available for new roadworks. But I urge the planners to get it right. As I have said in this parliament before on behalf of the people I represent, now is the time to implement correct planning procedures, not when it is too late. We want consideration of people's full needs. We want a continued guarantee from our government that when construction begins it will be done efficiently and with all the aspects&mdash;especially the potential impact on people's lives&mdash;taken into consideration. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Planners must take account of the fact that people in suburbs near the new airport site purchased properties years ago, never contemplating that an airport might one day be built nearby. Many local residents years ago made a conscious choice to live in the quiet rural areas of my electorate. Others who have moved in there since the 1975 subdivision began would not have had the slightest inkling that an airport could be constructed in the area and that they would end up under a flight path. I strongly advocate a position where that choice is not taken away from those people. What is planned and built today must be able to take us well and truly through the 21st century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I again urge planners to think about the implications each time a heavily laden aircraft flies low over Sydney's most densely populated western region. They must give particular consideration to take-off and landing in the very early hours of the morning and the impact this will have on residents' lives. I wonder if the planners and experts realise the noise generated by aircraft landing or taking off at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. That is what we now must as a government consider. All of these issues are further difficult issues to be faced by our government. I have full confidence that these issues will be faced and that this budget as outlined will certainly take us not only to an election but to the formulation of government in the 1996 period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, 34 years ago when I was born in Melbourne, Australia was a nation brimming with confidence. People like my parents were blessed with a faith in things as they were; in the institutions that nurtured and protected them. They were relaxed about the changes that were happening around them, happening at a pace to which they felt equal. Government at that time was behaving by and large sensibly. The tax rate for a family with two children living on the average wage was 15.8 per cent. Indeed, the income tax act was a sensible 385 pages long. Asia was just emerging from its colonial age and Singapore was two years old. That was the situation when I lay staring at the walls of that maternity ward. Now, as I utter my first few phrases in this parliament, things are vastly different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite you to look at Australia now. That same family pays not 15 per cent tax but 35 per cent. Every hour of every day our national debt grows by $3 million, illustrated again with this morning's announcement. Asia, in this borderless world, is for many of our citizens a terrifying thing. So on behalf of all Australians my age and younger I say to our government, our High Court, our trade unions, our academics, our bureaucrats, our business chiefs and the editors of our news media: look what you have done to our future. Look how you have feasted at our expense. I feel entitled to protest that, whereas my parents were taught to believe in things, I and my generation were instructed to martyr ourselves, to doubt and to evangelise a new creed of resentment and self-aggrandisement. We Australians are, as a result of that generational change, an increasingly enfeebled country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, before considering at greater length the problems and predicaments of Australia, a member of this House must first see to the needs of his or her electorate and to the welfare and the prosperity of its constituents. Despite some radical boundary changes, Wentworth in 1990 has largely retained its postwar flavour. It encompasses great affluence. Australia's most expensive residential real estate lies within the boundaries of Wentworth. It also encompasses many examples of grinding poverty. It is blessed with a diversity and with great historical depth. History in all its forms exists in Wentworth, from the RSLs to the survivors of the Jewish Holocaust. Only 57 per cent of Wentworth's residents were born in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of Wentworth is its nurturing of what I call the old life and the new life without conflict occurring between the two. It always gives me great joy to see how the traditions of an old beach culture still flourish at that great institution, the Bondi Icebergs. Members of that club&mdash;men and, recently, women&mdash;are intensely proud of their history as well as being proud of their attitudes. May they ever flourish. Likewise at the top of Bondi, up from the beach, lies the home in New South Wales of orthodox Judaism, at the Yeshiva Centre in Flood street. There on a Saturday morning you can see the faithful on their way to worship, determined by their costume and by their practices to preserve a tradition that is many centuries old, older of course than the Icebergs but just as precious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surrounding these two institutions that represent the old life exists the new Australia, the Australia of different lifestyle and of radical thought. Indeed, from Double Bay to Bondi Junction and down to Bondi Beach you can see change happening as fast as it happens anywhere else in the nation. These two Australias, the new and the old, coexist quite happily. It illustrates to me that we, the people of Wentworth, of whatever creed or background or culture or income, are not in as much conflict as our news media might suggest to us. The same can be said of the rest of Australia&mdash;that we have a decency that is not to be found in any other country on this planet. That said, it gives me cause for some shame and certainly anger to see how the synagogues and the Jewish schools of Wentworth require such enormous security measures, including even guards during school hours. Representing such a community requires of me a constant vigilance to see that this shame of racial or religious based attack is never ignored by government. But, equally, this issue requires from us in this House immense wisdom in pursuing effective measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In introducing myself to the community leaders in Wentworth, I found only goodwill and a frankness free of any partisan taint in any of the discussions I had about this or other difficult issues. I must say that I cannot imagine a better group of people with whom to consider such a difficult problem. I pledge to do my best to represent their interests with vigour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing that, I ask the government tonight to try to replace stridency with quiet and reasoned discussion, now that debate on the proposed racial vilification legislation has begun again. It is hard to imagine anything more damaging to the precious fabric of Australian society than for a debate on such a sensitive issue to become tainted with spite or, even worse, with electoral calculation. I feel pressed to warn the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch): in this task, you are dealing with the physical welfare and the lives of many good and decent people, so do not play with those lives for motives that are anything less than utterly sincere, because to do so would be to perpetrate a greater evil than the one we all seek to suppress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have the unusual distinction of having spent more of my life working outside Australia&mdash;in particular, Japan and other parts of Asia&mdash;than within it. I went to school in Taiwan for a short time, and I attended university in Tokyo&mdash;indeed, the same university as awarded this country's Prime Minister (Mr Keating) a qualification last week. He was given a Doctor of Laws, which was much higher than I could ever aspire to! I spent my time slaving away in the classroom, and I did not notice him there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, Japanese and Mandarin are my other languages. Because of that, I hold very strong views about Australia's relationship with Asia. In reality, it is far too complicated a subject to deal with other than at great length, because Asia is so diverse, with so many different languages and cultures within it. Instead, in the current public debate about this topic, I see that relationship as a code phrase for Australia's choices in the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is plain to me that we have lost most of our sovereignty. We have lost it through profligate government and through bureaucracy, the trade union movement and news media that are subversive to our long-term interests. But we do have some small scope left for making choices about our future. If we must focus on this relationship as a means of making those choices, then so be it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We suffer from a chronic balance of payments deficit, which was illustrated once again this morning. It is now so large as to imperil our future. Our currency gets cheaper as the years pass, as does our reputation and our safety with it. When speaking of approaches to our trading problems and this chronic financial deficit, we must never forget that our future and our fate as a trading nation is really determined in the medium- and long-term by what we teach our children in Australian schools. In that sense, education policy matters equally or at least as much as taxation or industrial relations policy. It would be nice to see that aspect of government dealt with more sensibly and at greater length in the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we hear our government urge us to sell more goods and services to Asia&mdash;I assume that is what integration with the region means&mdash;I say we should not look to Asia and to its markets but to ourselves and to the products we produce, the way we produce them and their cost and quality. In looking to ourselves, we must confront some ugly truths. We are no longer an economic or commercial society. We are a political society. As such, our future in this region and in this age does not really exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we continue to favour politics over commerce, if we continue to prefer screeching minorities and political parasites over small business people, risk takers and Australian workers, we will soon become little more than the tenant farmer of Asia, or perhaps a larger version of Hawaii, with beaches and souvenirs and a place for honeymooners. Perhaps this will hit home only when BHP is foreign owned. Already much of our media is foreign owned, as are much of our large manufacturing businesses. Maybe when the chairman of BHP carries a foreign passport and cannot sing the first verse of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS> will the devastation of Australian sovereignty become truly apparent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This loss of control over our destiny is, of course, more than financial. In terms of our culture, we really have little control over what the television broadcasters pour into our homes every night or, even worse, what Americanisms affect our languages, laws and news media. We are eager customers of Hollywood, and our own film industry is starved of capital because we as Australians cannot even save enough money to fund our own government any more, let alone our creative minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is another sort of sovereignty, and that too is rapidly ebbing away. I call it `personal sovereignty'. I define it as the feeling an individual Australian has about how much he or she is in control of his or her life. The answer these days is, of course, not very much. Since I became an adult, the rhetoric of government has tended to divide us into large groups. You all know those familiar labels&mdash;the banks, the media, the unions, the major parties and the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is we Australians feel not the slightest affinity with these groups in our daily lives. They are in power, not us. We feel disconnected so, when things have gone wrong, we have started to lash out and blame them for all our troubles&mdash;safe in the knowledge that someone else will pay or that the welfare state will always provide for us. This increasing reluctance to take responsibility for our own lives is the result of this personal sovereignty gradually crumbling away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think it is at the root of the incredible cynicism that Australians now bear towards their government. It certainly makes it very difficult to forge national goals. When you ask Australians why they hold their government in such utter contempt, you receive manifold examples. My conviction is that the electorate is finally disgusted with the stupidity of government. We cannot respect an institution that continues to delude itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, when a current account deficit figure of over $2 billion a month is announced, the Prime Minister describes it as a `good figure'. It is a terrible figure. Next, we learn that our unemployment numbers are determined not by counting the number of people receiving unemployment benefits but by a random survey. The person who has been lucky enough to enjoy one hour of paid employment in two weeks is classified as being employed. This is a farce, but you must say it is now the way of modern Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same fashion, it is simply false to measure growth in our GNP without subtracting increases in our national indebtedness. Really, the only economic growth that matters is the real rate of growth. I am sorry to say that that might be too radical a proposition for the government these days but, for those of us who believe that domestic democracy and honesty go hand in hand, it is plain commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So restoring some faith in government requires of us in this chamber a huge leap in the quality of what we debate. We must not shirk this task. We must never ignore reality outside this House. I hope I can contribute in some way to that, and I hope that Australians are not so poisoned by what has been done to them by this House that they no longer respect leaders who are brave enough to be frank with them. That is how you restore their personal sovereignty&mdash;by telling them the blunt and sometimes uncomfortable truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways, my predecessor fits that description. John Hewson was a brave man, and a man of unusual personal fortitude. I believe that history will show that this parliament was lucky to have known him as a member. I hope that in years to come Australians will remember him with gratitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, any new member of this House must feel gratitude in large measure. In my case, the list is long: my family, my friends, my wife, my colleagues in Australia, Japan and lately even in Scotland and my fellow soldiers in the cause of the Liberal Party, one of whom&mdash;Brian Briers&mdash;passed away during our campaign. He was a very good and decent man. Indeed, the Liberal Party is a changing creature. If Kooyong and Wentworth are now souvlaki and sushi, then I think we can say that the old order changeth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leaves me to conclude with an appeal to this House, a call I would like to make on behalf of the multitude of hardworking and hopeful Australians: we need no more grand schemes, glossy presentations or glittering launches of policy; we need quiet, vigorous, nuts-and-bolts reform achieved with long-term goals in mind.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each the budget debate provides members with the opportunity to canvass as widely as they wish across all of the areas of public policy. It is appropriate that there are occasions like a budget debate when that opportunity is provided to members. There are plenty of issues which members of parliament seek to pursue when debates of this kind are available to them, but I want to concentrate my remarks on the budget itself and some of the concerns that I have about the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that to a very large extent those people who operate in what we refer to as the markets, tend to look at the bottom line of the budget. Let me say at the outset that I am not one of those people who have a fetish about budget deficits or budget surpluses. I have sufficient experience with government budgets of all persuasions and at all levels of government to know that a surplus or a deficit and the size of a surplus or a deficit are not necessarily matters of great significance or as great significance as they are sometimes accorded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, for this coming financial year, the surplus will be $718 million, according to the forecast in the budget papers. It was not so very long ago when the government was indicating that by 1996-97 we would expect to get the budget into a position where the deficit would be equal to about one per cent of GDP. Then, on the basis of additional estimates that were made and changes which occurred in the national economy and in Australia's relationship with other countries, it looked as though it would be possible to balance the budget by 1996-97. What the government has achieved is a surplus one year earlier. As I say, the surplus is in excess of $700 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that comments have been made about the surplus. There have been references, for example, to what some people choose to call creative budgeting. I see nothing wrong with members of the opposition making claims of that kind. It is very likely that if we were in opposition we would be making similar observations. There have been references made, for example, to the sale of government assets and the fact that the sale of government assets then appears in the budget as a negative outlay. Some people have tried to make an issue of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that it accords with both IMF and United Nations standards indicates that, if the opposition were in government at present and if it were pursuing in a similar way the types of objectives which this government is pursuing and if it were constructing a budget on that basis, its budget would have been very similar to this government's budget. The opposition would have treated the sale of assets in precisely the same way. I will have more to say about that because I have some reservations about the structure of the budget, and I would like to make some comments about how I believe the structure of the budget could be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are other elements that the opposition refers to as creative budgeting&mdash;not only the sale of government assets but also the bringing forward of the repayment of loans by state governments. That has an impact on the bottom line of the budget. There is also the fact that governments in various ways are able to shift particular items out of the budget into, for example, government business enterprises or into authorities or agencies of various kinds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not necessarily imply, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, that those items of outlay disappear. It is just that they appear in a different guise. That contributes to the appearance of the bottom line and the general impression which the budget can provide. Another element of it is when governments require the government business enterprises to increase the size of the dividends which they pay to the government. So each of those has an impact on what we refer to as the bottom line of the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Procedures of that kind do not cause me any concern. I do not think they should cause anyone any particular concern. It is important how the national community, and particularly the economic community, perceives the budget and it is also important how the national community perceives the intentions of the government and the determination of the government to achieve certain objectives. I do not think there would be anyone who could reasonably claim&mdash;and, if they were to claim, they would not do so with any credibility&mdash;that successive Labor governments since 1983 have been anything but fiscally responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think for three or four years since that time cumulative budget surpluses have amounted to something like $18 billion. That was the first time that any national government had been able to budget for a surplus since the Commonwealth of Australia commenced to exist. I think that proves, more than many of the other indicators could have, the extent to which a federal Labor government was determined to be fiscally responsible, was determined to be fiscally stringent and was determined to examine all of the elements of the budget to ensure that any unnecessary outlays, any unnecessary forms of expenditure, were taken from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Treasurer (Mr Willis) introduced the budget, he made the point that budgeting for a surplus of $718 million represented a turnaround in the budget outcome of $12.9 billion, almost $13 billion, since last year. I have indicated that there are some elements of the budget which helped to explain that. But there was a net fiscal tightening involved in this year's budget of at least $3,000 million. That was not a matter that went unnoticed by the market and it was not a matter which the market failed to respond to favourably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been recognised in the community that on the surface this year's budget will not be able to make any significant difference to the current account deficit. I am not the only observer who has commented over a number of years that the current account deficit is the single most important problem which this government faces. This year the total of that deficit will be in excess of $20,000 million, which means that the Australian community and the Australian economy are dependent upon the savings of other countries to that extent. If, instead of our borrowing funds of that order to finance our external imbalance, overseas investors had been investing in Australia in equity, then each year the current account deficit would be lower than it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main reasons why the current account deficit continues at such a high level is that successive current account deficits in the past have contributed towards that overseas indebtedness on the part of the whole Australian community to the extent at present of about $160,000 million. If that $160,000 million, for example, were borrowed at an average interest rate of 10 per cent, there would be a debt servicing charge against the national economy of $16 billion every year. That is precisely why we are in the present position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very large proportion of our annual current account deficit represents the cost of servicing loans which were necessary to finance current account deficits in the past. It has been indicated, quite correctly, by government spokesmen that the current account deficit appears now to be levelling out, but it is still a matter of very considerable concern to the government and continues to be the single most important problem that we face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The surplus of over $700 million I referred to is also sometimes referred to as the headline budget. Very often the observation is made that the actual amount is within itself of little significance. I endorse that comment, except to qualify it by saying that inherent in the bottom line in the budget is an expression of the intention of the federal government in its fiscal responsibilities generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular matter of concern to me with the budget is that we persist with the construction of what is essentially a current budget; that is, almost a cash accounting budget, indicating total revenue which has been received and total outlays. The difference between those two totals is the resultant budget deficit or budget surplus. I believe it would be a more appropriate approach to budgeting generally if we were to have a current budget to deal with all of those current revenue and current outlay items, and a capital budget which would be concerned with the purchase and the disposal of assets and various types of investments which are undertaken by governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular concern which members of the government, as well as perhaps members of the opposition, have expressed from time to time is that, while the public sector, because of its nature and special responsibilities, should be responsible to a very large extent for the provision of national capital investment, national capital infrastructure, there has been a significant deficiency in the extent to which all levels of government in Australia have responded to that special responsibility. For example, recent figures on the US economy indicate that public sector investment over recent years has been negative; that is, the US government has either disposed of assets or allowed assets to run down to a greater extent than the new investment being undertaken in national infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When that happens, I believe the indications are serious indeed. That is why we need to ensure that national governments in particular take on the responsibility for ensuring that all of that infrastructure is in place and, in effect, providing a base for the private sector to be able to carry out the responsibilities which we see it as having. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget papers we do distinguish between aggregates for current items and capital items, but we do not distinguish between a current budget and a capital budget, as I believe we should. Another disadvantage of our failure to do that is that new investment&mdash;which should not be seen as a profligate financial exercise being undertaken by government&mdash;is seen as a charge against current revenue instead of being seen, as I believe it should be, as a charge against the continuing flow of income which it will generate into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of including capital investment in what is essentially a current budget, the budget deficit appears to be increased. That often serves the purpose of giving a very wrong impression to those people who observe our budget and who seek to make something not only of the structure of the budget but of the government's intentions in relation to it. I believe it would be a very useful innovation for us to introduce that change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, within the budget papers at present there is a distinction made and it is possible to extract some of that information. But, for example, if you were to extract those capital items from the end of the Second World War until about the mid-1980s, then for most of those years there was no deficit at all&mdash;in fact, a surplus&mdash;despite the fact that during all of that time the budget had as its bottom line a deficit. The overall surplus during the four years towards the end of the 1980s became much more significant. I have already made reference to the fact that, during those four years when we budgeted for a surplus and achieved a surplus, we had a cumulative aggregate of those surpluses of about $18,000 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, the budget has gone into a composite deficit. If I could go back to the mid-1980s, in 1984-85, for example, there was a slight current deficit of $1 billion; in 1985-86 it was balanced; in 1986-87 there was a large surplus; and those large surpluses continued through until 1990-91. By the time we got to 1992-93, the current deficit was $10 billion, but the total deficit was $14.6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By failing to separate out current items from capital items, the wrong impression is given. I know that the difference was only $4.6 billion, but that $4.6 billion did not represent current expenditure by the government; it represented capital investment by the government in the process of building that infrastructure. In 1993-94 there was practically no new capital investment, and the same was the case in 1994-95. This year the amount of capital investment is minimal when compared with the total in the current budget. I would appeal for that distinction to be made between current and capital items. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

This is another classic Keating budget&mdash;more spending, more fiddles, more promises of economic nirvana and more taxes. The appropriation bills for 1995-96 have three components. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) deals with funding for the Commonwealth's programs. This bill will appropriate $31.7 billion for spending on annual programs. Appropriation Bill (No. 2) deals with funding for payments to the states and capital works. The bill authorises funding of $4.3 billion. Finally, there is the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1995-96, which will authorise funding for the running of Parliament House. This bill will appropriate $144.5 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriation bills also make allowances for the Financial Management and Accountability Bill to be reflected in them should the Financial Management and Accountability Bill pass into law. Of course, these bills do not cover the vast majority of Commonwealth expenditure, which is dealt with via standing appropriations and does not need yearly appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills authorise the government to spend funds on its annual programs and, as such, we will not be opposing them. But the government should not delude itself as to our view on the budget. We know this budget is yet more electoral fraud, we know this budget is cobbled together with asset sales and one-off gimmicks to get the government to an election; and we will not let the government walk away from this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) told us that this budget would be about savings and would set in train the lift in national savings this country so desperately needs. But, as we expected, this government has shown itself to be once again not up to the task. Once again, this budget is all about rhetoric and not about action. Once again, this budget is about gimmicks and not about action. Once again, this budget is about the Prime Minister continuing his strategy of fraud with the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country has a significant foreign debt problem. The government realises this but refuses to do anything about it. It has forecast a current account deficit of $27 billion for this year and next. The forecast deficits are unacceptably high and simply continue feeding into the ever growing mountain of foreign debt which will be the legacy of this Labor government. What we need is a strong and sustained lift in savings, both public and private. The most effective way for the government to assist in this task is to structurally reduce the budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the government's solution? To bring down a gimmick budget to get it past the next election. Responsible economic management is the last thing on Paul Keating's mind. Although the Treasurer (Mr Willis) was allowed to introduce the budget, this budget has `Paul Keating' written all over it. There was the massaging of market expectations, saying that a surplus was too big an ask, there was the leaking of proposals to see what people thought; and then on budget night, lo and behold, there was a small surplus&mdash;another rabbit out of the hat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is a hollow surplus, and everyone in this parliament, including the Prime Minister, knows it. In fact, tucked away in the back of the budget papers, the ABS tells us the real story: it is a deficit of $8.2 billion. That is because one of the main components of the government's so-called surplus is over $5.3 billion worth of asset sales. Having already taxed as much as it could in one budget, the government was so woefully short of a respectable number that it reached for asset sales. This is a perennial measure for Labor, trying to improve the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that items such as ANL and Qantas have been there for years, it does not actually intend selling very much, but it put it in there anyway. In fact, the record speaks for itself. Since 1990-91, the government has forecast asset sales of $8,075 million. The government has actually sold only $3,789 million worth of assets. After selling only $3.8 billion over the last four years, the government is trying to tell us that it will sell or achieve $5.3 billion this year. Who is the government trying to kid? It will not make the target, and it damn well knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is already in trouble. It has an offer for ANL, which has been listed yet again. Government members may remember this as the shipping line that it could not give away. Now somebody is willing to give cash for it. But what happens? The Maritime Union of Australia is not happy&mdash;and that is nothing unusual. It does not like the potential buyer. It is concerned that P&amp;O may want to treat ANL as a going commercial concern and end some of the union's archaic practices. No wonder the MUA is horrified at the prospect of being weaned off the taxpayers' purse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In true MUA style, it is threatening to bring the country's ports to a standstill&mdash;no matter that this will further damage our trading reputation, no matter that it will cost jobs and no matter that it will further damage the Australian economy. The MUA has never worried about these things in the past. The only thing that matters is the position of the union leaders and the highly protected position of a few hundred shipping units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the prediction now&mdash;and I hope that I am wrong&mdash;that ANL will not be sold to P&amp;O. There will be another inquiry into ANL's future with some restructuring, it will be put to tender again with the government quoting some concerns about the market offer or the government will impose so many conditions that ANL will walk away from it. But the truth will be that the unions will forbid the government to go ahead with the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pressure is on. Two weeks out from the budget, the first asset sale is here. Can the government make the grade? I very much doubt it. Even if the government does manage to sell anything, it will still not make any difference to national savings. All it does is to substitute public savings for private savings. So, in terms of national savings, the government has again dropped the ball by counting asset sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, asset sales are not the only swindle. There are all the little one-offs thrown in to make this year's bottom line look a little better. There is the $990 million thrown in by Wayne Goss, ostensibly for early debt retirement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has tried all the tricks that it knows after 12 years of experience in playing the smoke and mirrors game. It has done everything except what was required, and that was to cut back spending. The government cannot hide from the truth. Indeed, its own budget papers have it there. On page 2 of the Treasurer's speech it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures announced tonight provide a net fiscal tightening, excluding the effect of asset sales and early debt redemptions, of $3 billion in 1995-96 and $4 1/2 billion in 1996-97.</PARA>

<PARA>A mere $700 million. After what the government calls a rigorous assessment of expenditures, it managed to cut net outlays by a whole $700 million in a budget with outlays worth $129 billion in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know what net outlays do once we clear away all the nonsense of asset sales and debt redemption? In 1995-96 outlays increased by 1.7 per cent in real terms, or $6.6 billion. After all the talk of calling back ministers to put them through the ERC again, this government increased spending by 1.7 per cent in real terms in 1995-96. After three years of growth, with particularly strong growth in 1994, this is all the government is still up to: spending. The government has proven itself to be incapable of controlling its spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is always extolling the virtues of restraint. What it means is restraint for everyone else because it wants to go on spending. As part of this extra spending the government has, of course, thrown in a good number of election sweeteners. There is a range of measures for the family costing $93 million in 1995-96 and $747 million over four years. These include a lump sum maternity allowance worth $643 million over four years, an increase in rental assistance worth $88 million over four years and an increase in the guardian allowance for sole parents costing $117 million over three years. There is also an election slush fund called the Better Cities mark 2 worth $254 million over four years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not even a week out from the budget and the Prime Minister is out there making promises with other people's money. He is going to build more roads and lengthen runways. Given all the boasting by the Prime Minister about his headline surplus, I trust he will keep us informed as he spends the money over the next couple of months. This is a government which just cannot control its spending. That is what the problem is: it is government spending. It is not a revenue problem, as the Prime Minister claims it is and as he claimed last year. The only revenue problem we have is with a government that keeps wanting more so it can spend more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a traditional tax and spend Labor government, and it has proved it in this budget. Not only did it continue spending like there was no tomorrow, but it gave tax receipts a mighty kick along as well. Revenue changes announced in this budget will add $2.4 billion in tax this year, rising to $7.8 billion in extra tax in 1998-99. Company tax has gone up three per cent, raising $320 million in 1995-96, rising to $1.57 billion in 1996-97. The Medicare levy is to increase by 0.1 per cent to 1.5 per cent. This will raise $230 million in 1995-96, rising to $280 million in 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other big whack for families is the lift in the wholesale sales tax on cars from 16 per cent to 21 per cent. This will raise $330 million in 1995-96, rising to $405 million in 1998-99. The building industry, which is already in sharp decline, will face further hardship following an extension of the wholesale sales tax to certain building materials. This will raise $215 million in 1995-96, rising to $290 million in 1998-99. This will lift the price of an average $100,000 home between $1,000 and $2,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both ordinary Australians and corporate Australia have been reminded of the flexibility of Keating tax promises. In 1993 a lower corporate tax rate was something about which Paul Keating frequently boasted. It was a key plank in making Australia more competitive and assisting in making us a centre for regional headquarters. Two years later, international competitiveness seems to be less important. The corporate tax rate has gone from 33 per cent to 36 per cent. The argument runs that companies are making good profits and Australia is a low tax country so we can lift company tax. In the first instance, it is profits which provide companies with the capacity to invest, grow and employ. When we have about 750,000 people unemployed, I personally do not think we should be reducing the capacity of companies to grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then of course there is the other ALP furphy that Australia is a low tax country and there is scope to lift tax. The ALP conveniently forgets to add in the compulsory superannuation levy. When we add this in, as it is equivalent to retirement arrangements in other countries, we then move up the comparative tax ladder towards midfield. When we add in the new company tax hike, the lift in indirect taxes and the employee superannuation, we climb even higher in the tax stakes. Apart from the fact that the government is misleading people with claims of being a low tax country, one should be careful when comparing company taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prime Minister Keating has recently discovered Asia. He is now telling us that Asia is the growth engine and we should cash in on it. It would of course help if our tax arrangements were competitive. In addition to our education levels, R&amp;D, national infrastructure, et cetera, our tax levels will have a bearing on how competitive we are in Asia. Under the new higher company tax arrangements our companies will pay 36c in the dollar. As of 1994, comparisons of corporate taxes in Asia are: Japan, 36 per cent to 51 per cent depending on income; South Korea, 18 per cent to 32 per cent depending on income; Indonesia, 35 per cent; Singapore, 27 per cent; Malaysia, 32 per cent; Philippines, 35 per cent; Thailand, 30 per cent; and New Zealand, 28 per cent. We are clearly similar to Japan but higher than the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the relativities that count, and they are consistent with Paul Keating's Asia push, we are not a low tax country. Generally speaking, we are an above average taxer. As I said before, when we have 750,000 people unemployed, this lift in tax will not appear to be helping that situation at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The domestic car industry, already starting to struggle, faces an even tougher battle with the increase in sales tax. This will add about $1,000 to the price of a new car and make it harder for people to upgrade. This will also undermine the government's environment strategy by making it harder to purchase more efficient cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the greatest swindle in this budget is employee superannuation with a tax trade-off for low income groups. The government, through these arrangements and awards, will require employees to contribute three per cent of their earnings to superannuation by the year 2000. The government will apparently make means tested superannuation contributions to match  those made by employees in lieu of proceeding with the second tranche of tax cuts. Yet another Keating backflip is revealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the superannuation take from employees, while low income groups in the work force may be compensated, all other employees will be worse off. Self-funded retirees will be another group that will feel the burden of this Keating backflip. They were looking for tax cuts and they got nothing. Let us be quite clear: to the average person this is simply another lift in tax, but rather than hand their money to the tax office they will hand it to superannuation companies. They have no choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same holds true for the Medicare levy. Waiting lists continue to impede health care as more and more people desert the private health system. In the last five years 1.2 million people have dropped out of private health insurance. The level of private health cover now stands at 35.6 per cent, when former Minister for Health Graham Richardson labelled crisis point at 40 per cent. The verdict for the Australian people is revealed in a recent MBF-Morgan survey which showed that one in seven Australians now plans to drop private cover because of the government's latest Medicare levy rise. For every one per cent that leave, the cost to the budget is another $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More people will now leave private health care, which will raise the cost of public health care.

We believe that asset sales should be used for debt retirement and the provision of worthwhile infrastructure. They should not be used for recurrent expenditure. You can sell something only once.

Asset sales simply delay the inevitable adjustment to spending or tax, which suits the ALP because it is not solving the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The election of a coalition government will usher in a new era of government accountability and responsibility.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government has again let the Australian people down.

In 1970, Mr Lloyd Hirst purchased a manually operated masonry brick-block making machine capable of making 4,500 blocks per day.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars was borrowed from the Commonwealth Development Bank towards a $650,000 expansion program to take advantage of this market against the security of Boulder Brick and Tile's assets of over $2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 12 months later, Boulder Brick and Tile was $100,000 short to finish the expansion and applied to the CDB, the Commonwealth Development Bank, for funding. `Whilst the application was proceeding', Mr Hirst said, `we became $50,000 in arrears on the existing loans.' Without rejecting the loan application, and without discussion with the principal director and guarantor, the CDB issued a demand for payment of some $380,000 by 4.30 p.m. the following day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hirst immediately telephoned the state manager of the CDB to indicate that the arrears could be paid immediately. The response was, `We don't want the arrears, we want the lot and have appointed receivers and managers.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that day on the business wasted away. What should have been an extremely profitable business became, in the hands of accountants Melsom and Robson, a disaster. Although Kalgoorlie-Boulder experienced unprecedented growth, apart from one contract which was awarded to it, requiring the working of double shifts during the first few months of the receivership operation, no effort was made by it to properly manage and control the business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hirst and his accountant Kendle offered to assist in the management because it could be seen that the receivers and managers were losing some quarter of a million dollars per annum.

The cost of production, using five men and materials, was $3,500, leaving a net profit for the day of $8,500. These figures can be verified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How could a bank&mdash;and a receiver and manager&mdash;do such a thing? Of course they were often only producing for one day per week. But the receiver and manager had no sales staff and no competent manager of the business. One might well ask how this could happen. I actually took this up with the development bank at the time because I thought its actions were extremely precipitous and it just would not listen to reason. Here was a man with assets of over $2 million. He got into arrears of some $30,000 through, in fact, an oversight, offered to make it up immediately, but was rejected by the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be some sanction about receivers and managers. I have many accounts of banks appointing receivers and managers who are literally cowboys. They go in to absolutely gut the businesses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to remind the House of the continuing disaster that is occurring in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I refer, in particular, to the failure of the United Nations, the European Community and all those recognised Western powers, as they are often referred to in the newspapers and other media, to deal with a situation that is quite clearly similar to those throughout its unfortunate recent history. On 6 February this year I moved a motion on this subject which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) deplores the abject failure of the UN to protect the people of Bihac, Bosnia-Herzegovina, from attack by the forces of the Bosnia Serbs and their allies;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) calls on the UN to lift its sanctions on arms supplies to the armed forces of the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) rejects proposals to divide or cantonise Bosnia and Herzegovina.</PARA>
<PARA>Today we see in our newspapers and in the electronic media the unfortunate situation where 250 UN peacekeepers are being held and used as hostages by the Bosnian Serb forces. I cannot think of any other outrage in recent history that surpasses this in provocative effect. This area was subject to enormous provocation in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irony is that the very people who have been sent to keep the peace now find themselves in extreme danger. As we have seen in more recent times, the government of France, in particular through President Chirac, has threatened to withdraw its forces from Bosnia-Herzegovina if there is no action to try to beef up the peacekeeping resources and forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the face of this quite outrageous behaviour by the Bosnian Serb forces. I visited Sarajevo in 1992 and 1993. In both cases, I was able to see the enormously dangerous conditions the French, British, some New Zealanders and other peacekeepers were working under in that city and elsewhere. It was certainly dangerous to visit places like Bihac and Tuzla. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Croatia, and formerly Slovenia, we have seen from 1991&mdash;1992 in the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina&mdash;the same systematic method of operation used by the aggressors in all cases. The seizure of UN peacekeepers and their use as hostages is the most recent example of a very consistent pattern of aggressive behaviour that the west, the United Nations and the European Community ought to have recognised from the word go. A number of us have consistently made speeches in this place calling for a resolute response to this type of aggression and this type of behaviour. We believe from the word go that bullying had to be met with either force or resolute behaviour by those who had the responsibility for negotiating peace or any form of settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now see this ridiculous, almost tragic, situation where peacekeepers are being chained outside of buildings that may be considered as targets in the UN strikes that are being used to try to force the Bosnian Serb forces to desist from their aggressive behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the final analysis, nothing has changed since February when the motion was moved by the member for Fowler (Mr Grace) and me. It is quite clear that we must lift the sanctions on arms supplies to the armed forces of the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina, so that, in the absence of any resolute action by the peacekeepers, at least that government will be in a position to bring stability to the situation and to match this naked aggression and terrorism that has been launched on the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina by the Bosnian Serbs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to my good friend Mr Jim Priest, who writes for local papers in my electorate, for recently drawing to the attention of his readers his concerns about the increasing trend for banks to impose fees and other charges on accounts held by small savers, particularly those with balances of less than $500. Jim is a well-regarded local authority on many issues of concern to pensioners and to other low income earners through his involvement with the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his column, Mr Priest said that two-thirds of Australia's 1.64 million aged pensioners&mdash;the majority of whom are older women who have few resources and who are likely to be hardest hit by fees and charges&mdash;live on incomes of less than $200 a week. Many have only modest savings, and Mr Priest claims&mdash;with good cause&mdash;that they are being victimised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Priest raised a number of other issues in the context of the Prices Surveillance Authority inquiry into bank charges. Among these issues was the difficulty that new banking technology poses to people with physical or intellectual handicaps, who are being penalised because of it. An example of this is the increasing use of automatic teller machines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the public debate on the fairness, or otherwise, of bank fees and charges, a number of arguments have emerged, some of which I would like to address here this evening. One of the most extraordinary claims to come out of this debate&mdash;and I am disappointed to note that the claim is supported by the opposition spokesperson on finance, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser)&mdash;is that banks do not have a social responsibility to small customers. Some recent media reports have included the following claims: banks are not obliged to subsidise the poor; banks do not really want poor pensioners at all; banks have no social responsibility beyond providing standard banking services; small customers are uneconomic customers; banks have a social responsibility only to shareholders and owners; and banks have no obligation to develop a social conscience or to hand out charity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Forrest was reported to have said that banks have no obligation to provide a subsidised or free service to pensioners and other low income clients, and that banks, like any other business, must make a profit. They do. Last year, the big banks earned $6,000 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, banks and other financial institutions do have a crucial role to play in our community. The Australian Banking Association has said that Australia could not function without a banking system, and that is self-evident. The ABA has also said that banks provide a safe haven for depositors. I agree that banks are essential and should provide a safe haven for those who desire it. But judging from the spiralling imposts on small savers, it would appear that this is no longer the case for many in our community who are being deliberately priced out of the bank system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In undertaking its inquiry on banking and deregulation in 1991, the Martin report sought to provide a definition of a bank. The following definitions may be useful in considering some of the current issues. One definition says that they are for accepting deposits and making loans&mdash;the basic banking responsibility. The committee report also said that they are for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the collection of money by receiving deposits upon loan . . . and the utilisation of the money so collected by lending it. . . These are the essential functions of a bank as an instrument of society.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, another definition is that it forms part of the commercial, economic and social organisation of the community. I emphasise `social organisation of the community'. I think these are good general definitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In undertaking this role, the banks provide financial services to the community. They are major employers. Through their extensive branch networks, they provide daily access for the community to the payment system. They participate in providing housing to the community. And they play an important role in developing Australia's economy. In short, banks are a part of our society and they do have social responsibility&mdash;and to suggest otherwise is scandalous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that some of those comments more recently have been taken up by banks. They say that, like any other business, they are a business in the private sector in Australia&mdash;and they have endorsed that earlier comment that they have a responsibility essentially to their shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what happened to the Commonwealth Bank. But when I was a kid in primary school it sent out, apparently at considerable expense, its tellers to sit on the other side of a table and accept my penny into my savings account. I have banked with the Commonwealth Bank ever since, largely as a result of that introduction. Where now is the people's bank?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My friend and colleague the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) also referred earlier to some of those concerns about the way in which the banks operate. They are instruments of society. They should accept that responsibility and they should accept the social responsibility that goes with it. It is not appropriate for them to continue to be grasping, as they have been in more recent years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 March this year, I was approached by the principal of one of the major state high schools in my electorate concerning a program that was put to air by Brisbane radio station B105. This particular incident occurred after what the principal described as `quite a challenging week' for the school. In that week he had had to deal with one stabbing, three serious fights, two threats of assault on administration members, two threats to shoot staff, and one actual assault on a teacher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It happened that during the night-time program on B105, on the particular evening of one of these events at the high school, the two personalities known as Krusty and Rachael, who broadcast an advice line, were approached by what was assumed to be one of the students of this state high school.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A transcript of a tape of the program was given to me&mdash;and the program was taped when on air&mdash;and perhaps I could read to the House what that particular advice was. The transcript reads:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ListenerThat's not a bad idea actually.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">KrustyYeh right, I never said that.</PARA>
<PARA>And on it went. The point is that this radio program is designed to appeal to the young and subteenagers. The prime listening audience of this particular radio station is aimed at seven- to 19-year-olds. When you have students who have these sorts of difficulties at our state high schools, whether it is intended as a joke or not&mdash;and the station management has said to my representations to the Australian Broadcasting Authority that it was a joke&mdash;that sort of advice should not be tendered by two intellectual degenerates like Krusty and Rachael. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think that the prime object of anybody who has the public trust of a broadcasting licence is to make sure that standards are met, that we do not have a situation where our community standards are flouted and where the discipline of a high school&mdash;which is obviously under some strain anyway&mdash;is undermined by the likes of these two creatures going on air and broadcasting rubbish like that. I am not totally satisfied with the response of B105 to the Broadcasting Tribunal, or the Broadcasting Authority as it is now. I think it was the Wednesday night when that broadcast went to air, but I note that on the Friday night they were still making references to the phone call. I think that, in itself, is absolutely crazy: that you have two so-called radio personalities promoting stalking, destruction, damage and, in fact, physical assault. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Broadcasting Authority obviously will have a time to review the licence of B105. B105 says in its letter to the Broadcasting Authority that in future that program will be taped and the focus will be more on commonplace humour and not on some of this offbeat humour. If this offbeat humour is designed to appeal to our teenagers, then all I can say is that we have a very sick society and we have a very sick broadcasting industry. Quite frankly, I think B105 and the two personalities involved should be condemned. I very much look forward to receiving from the minister the response to my further representations on the attitude of B105. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of local government councils in New South Wales are currently increasing their mayoral and councillors' allowances as provided for by a recent decision of the New South Wales Remuneration Tribunal. This follows changes to the New South Wales Local Government Act. My old council, Campbelltown City Council, has just decided to increase its mayoral allowance to $30,000 a year and the councillors' allowance from the current $5,000 to $12,500 a year. Of course, when I was on the council just over two years ago we got only $3,000 a year. So I think this rise is entirely justified and long overdue in recognition of the time and effort put in by local councillors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next door to my electorate, the Camden council has increased its mayoral allowance to $20,000 a year and the councillors' allowance to $9,000 a year. As Camden is nowhere near as big as Campbelltown, it perhaps felt that this was all it could justify. But it is interesting to look at the reaction of some of the Campbelltown councillors who voted against the increase. Of course, this is a council election year in New South Wales and the usual petty opportunists on Campbelltown council, led by Councillor Jim Kremmer, are trying to use these rises as the basis of an election stunt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Councillor Kremmer criticised the rises in allowances as a `greedy, money-grabbing exercise', while his running mate Councillor Ron Owers made it clear that he would make this a `hot election issue'. This is the same Councillor Kremmer who, in September 1990, when he was the Labor mayor, demanded that the Labor caucus, of which I was a member, vote to increase his mayoral allowance by 75 per cent to $35,000 a year. Let me make it clear that I supported the rise in the mayoral allowance at the time because I believed then, and I still believe, that mayors and councillors are underpaid for the hours and the work expected of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor caucus did unanimously support the rise in Councillor Kremmer's allowance. But Councillor Kremmer made it clear that he intended to use the money to fund his re-election campaign, which of course he was legally entitled to do. But Councillor Kremmer, after he took the money, resigned from the Labor Party and stood firstly as an Independent candidate for the seat of Moorebank in the 1991 state election. Councillor Kremmer directed his preferences to the Liberal Party in that election, after his close friend and associate Mr Michael Knight had failed to gain Labor preselection for Moorebank. Councillor Kremmer then led an Independent ticket for the 1991 council election, getting himself and Ron Owers elected at the expense of the Labor Party's candidates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the beginning of a very strange period in politics around Campbelltown, with some ALP members clearly supporting Councillor Kremmer at the expense of the ALP ticket. So Councillor Kremmer had got the Labor caucus to increase his mayoral allowance, pocketed the money for his election campaign and then left the party to run as an Independent in both state and council elections. Meanwhile, the Labor caucus was left wearing the political flak for having increased the allowance. Labor lost control of the council at the election, losing three seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The incoming council in 1991 reduced the mayoral allowance back to its previous level of around $20,000. Now, in another council election year, Councillor Kremmer and Councillor Owers&mdash;ever the grubby opportunists&mdash;have the gall and the absolute hypocrisy to come out attacking the council for increasing both the mayoral and the councillors' allowances as provided for under the new Local Government Act. Nobody should be fooled for one minute by this cynical stunt; this hypocritical nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing is quite clear: Councillor Kremmer, who still of course has close contact with some people in the Labor Party, will again be running for council and he clearly will not need his councillor's allowance to fund his election campaign this time. He will no doubt have lots of friends and lots of support from companies like Monarch Developments, which recently had a major development application approved. He also has many other friends who will support his campaign&mdash;lots of friends indeed.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr Lee</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on information provided by Telstra and Australia Post:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) AUSTEL has responsibility for verifying the costs claimed by Telstra each year in providing loss-making services under its universal service obligation. AUSTEL determines the universal service levy and the amounts due to Telstra by other carriers. AUSTEL is currently determining the amount for 1993-94. I will advise the honourable member of the amount when it is available. I can advise, however, that the Universal Service Cost for the previous financial year 1992-93 was $149,170,304 of which Optus Communications Pty Limited, as the only other participating carrier during the year, contributed $1,455,819.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(b) Australia Post estimates the cost of its Community Service Obligations every year as required under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989. The estimates are obtained by application of an unavoidable cost methodology and relate solely to those instances where letter services are provided, in pursuance of the Community Service Obligations, at prices which do not recover cost. The total unrecovered cost of such services, therefore, represents the cost of the Community Service Obligations. For 1993/94, Australia Post's Community Service Obligations are estimated to have cost $50 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) As the Universal Service Carrier, Telstra's Universal Service Obligations require the company to ensure that the standard telephone service and payphones are reasonably accessible to all Australians on an equitable basis, wherever they live or carry on business. AUSTEL is responsible for administering the Universal Service Obligation arrangements. AUSTEL is also required to monitor and report to the Minister regarding Telstra's performance in meeting its Universal Service Obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post's community service obligations are defined in section 27 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 (the Act). Section 27 requires that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post provide a letter service for domestic and international mail;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the letter service must be available at a uniform price for standard letters carried within Australia by ordinary post;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">in view of the social importance of the letter service, it should be reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">performance standards (including delivery times) for the letter service should reasonably meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(a)(i)-(iii) Under the Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Act 1991, Telstra, Optus and Vodafone have been declared participating telecommunications carriers. This means they are required to share the costs of meeting Universal Service Obligations based on their share of timed telecommunications traffic. AUSTEL is responsible for assessing the contributions of each carrier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contributions received from Optus and Vodafone are paid into the Universal Service Levy Trust Fund administered by the Department of Communications and the Arts. These contributions are subsequently paid out to Telstra by the Department as soon as possible&mdash;that is, within a matter of days of receipt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that Telstra funds its share of the costs incurred in providing loss making services under the Universal Service Obligations from elsewhere in its business, as do the other two carriers. There is no Commonwealth Budget Allocation for the Universal Service Obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(b) The funding of Australia Post's Community Service Obligations is as follows:</PARA>
