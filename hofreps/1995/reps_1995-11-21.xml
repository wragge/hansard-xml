<PARA>The amendment to the ANL Sale Bill 1995 made in the Senate sets a cap on the expenditure that may be appropriated for the purpose of clause 67(2). This clause appropriates money which may be necessary to meet the needs for working capital of any Commonwealth company that is to hold assets, rights, liabilities and obligations transferred out of ANL prior to its sale to P&amp;O in accordance with the draft sale agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment was moved by the government in the Senate to meet concerns that this appropriation was unlimited. In fact, the original appropriation was only to be available to provide working capital for the 1995-96 financial year. But the government is prepared to set an upper limit of $1 million on the amounts that may be appropriated for this purpose. The amendment inserts into clause 67 section 2A, which sets a ceiling of $1 million on the amount that may be provided under clause 67(2). I commend the amendment. </PARA>

I addressed the question of that appropriation together with the other much larger appropriation of $15 million during my speech on the second reading debate and in consideration in detail. We had many concerns about both appropriations. I was pleased to get an early undertaking in the open parliament concerning this $1 million limit being placed. The $15 million, which was of far more concern, was then subject to undertakings given to me by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) personally on the eve of the Senate hearing. On that basis, the bill has been agreed to. I am pleased to see this amendment now.</PARA></TALK.START>

However, the government accepts that qualification of all the principles underlying the part by reference to the best interests of the child may assist in strengthening the message to parents that they cannot seek to subvert these principles to argue for their own rights rather than those of their children. The government, therefore, supported in the other place an amendment to provide this qualification to all the principles. As amended, the principles therefore establish a presumption of shared responsibility by parents for caring for their children. This sharing of responsibility can only be altered by agreement between the parents or by the court if it is not in the best interests of the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original intention of the late Senator Murphy was that the Family Law Act would create a rebuttable presumption of shared parenting, but over the years the Family Court has chosen to largely ignore that. It is hoped that these reforms will now call for much closer attention to this presumption and that the Family Court will give full and proper effect to the intention of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One amendment which I particularly commend to the House is the amendment of section 69C, which deals with applications to the court in children's matters. This section will now include a specific reference to grandparents as persons who may apply for orders in relation to children. Grandparents are in some cases the major point of stability for children during the breakdown of their parents' relationship. While grandparents are able to make application under the current provisions, and have done so, this express reference to grandparents will reinforce the bill's message to parents that they must focus on what is best for their children by including grandparents and other members of the extended family important to the children when they are settling arrangements for the care of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments strengthen the requirement upon the Family Court generally to make orders which are consistent with any family violence orders and to ensure that the terms of its orders do not expose people to risk of family violence. The encouragement of the use of primary dispute resolution processes is tempered by a more overt recognition that these processes are not always appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large number of the amendments effect a change from the term `special purpose order' to `specific issues order' in reference to those parts of a parenting order which deal with specific aspects of parental responsibility. The new term is more descriptive and will avoid any possible inference that such orders should be made only in special circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill lists the factors that the court must take into account in determining the best interests of the child. These factors are expanded by a number of amendments. One of the government amendments requires consideration of any need to maintain a connection with Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders. In addition, a new paragraph has been inserted to require the court to consider the practicalities of contact and whether there are practical difficulties and expense which will affect the child's right to have contact with both parents. The government will accept this amendment which may be of assistance in ensuring that full consideration is given to the effects of, for example, parents living a long way apart. Another amendment which improves the bill ensures that the best interests of the child are given paramount consideration by the court, regardless of whether or not an order is made by consent, and that the court is provided with a discretion in the case of consent orders as to the factors which are to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant feature of the new part VII is parenting plans. The purpose of these provisions is to encourage parents to agree together, or with assistance from a counsellor or mediator, on matters affecting children rather than to have them judicially determined. Again, parents are directed to give the best interests of the child paramount consideration in working out their agreed plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes that the requirements of a parenting plan should simply be that it be in writing and that it be made between the parents. In general, a parenting plan corresponds with a parenting order. Accordingly, it may deal with child residence, contact or maintenance or any other relevant issue. We recognise that parents should be able to make decisions on such issues without interference from external sources. However, registration with the court is necessary if the agreement is to be enforceable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, consideration of this matter in the other place has led to significantly increased formality and cost in registration. It will probably make this aspect of the proposals less attractive to parties. Nevertheless, the government will accept the amendment to achieve the primary benefits of the major reforms which are to encourage parents to reach agreement as to how they will care for their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there are a number of improvements to the detail of the bill and technical matters dealt with by the amendments. The government will accept all amendments passed by the other place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments to the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 which are before us arise as a result of very detailed consideration by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. We do not oppose the broad principles of this bill. We did have a number of concerns about it. The bill deals with a number of issues relating to mediation and children. It contains some philosophical changes relating to custody and, in particular, access. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) has dealt with those matters. As I understand it, the Senate committee produced two reports. There are still some matters relating to a separate bill&mdash;the Family Law Reform Bill (No. 2) 1994&mdash;which need consideration, but my comments relate to the Family Law Reform Bill 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I observe that there has always been a very healthy interest in family law matters in this parliament. I was here when the Family Law Act was first enacted. The parliament debated the contents of that bill over a very much longer period than we would normally see accorded to legislation today. Interestingly enough, in relation to those deliberations, there were views expressed across the normal partisan party political boundaries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had some views on the matter. I certainly followed the matter with an interest when the Fraser government sought to review the Family Law Act. I was chairman of the first select committee reviewing the Family Law Act. It was a joint committee. We still have a joint committee today. It is interesting that when I look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> I find that it has a current inquiry which relates to administration and funding of the Family Court of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my own experience in my own electorate, I have to say that I am frequently faced with parties who are concerned about the operations of the Family Law Act and the court. It is well known in relation to other matters that have flowed, particularly in relation to child support, that there is a very wide and significant degree of interest in the community as a whole, which we all face in our electorates day after day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What interests me here is that it is only one house of this parliament that is devoting itself to consideration of important issues on which I think members of this House equally have a view. We are going to adopt amendments today&mdash;the opposition will not be opposing the proposals that have come forward from the Senate any more than the government has&mdash;in order to get the bill, and there will be some compromises. But the fact is that those compromises are being formed and determined in another chamber involving our colleagues, who obviously would be approached on these matters by their constituents within the states they represent. But I would hazard a guess that they are probably not as frequently approached by constituents anguished about the Family Law Act and its operations as we in this chamber are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to encourage the parliamentary secretary to, when we are looking at bills of this sort, again look at the role of this chamber in relation to these matters. I do not mind it being a joint billing, but I am concerned that, at the end of the day, the matters we are looking at are matters in which it is only senators whose compromised views are being accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters I will discuss relate to the parenting plans, the imprisonment of registrars, family violence and grandparents. The most notable failure of the government was its difficulty with the implementation of committee recommendations with respect to parenting plans. The parliamentary secretary foreshadowed concerns about the complexity. These parenting plans do deal with welfare of children, residents, contacts and schooling matters&mdash;a whole host of issues in which parties do try to reach some agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an issue in which the role of the Family Court with respect to parenting plans was going to have to be addressed. Parenting plans as registered can become orders of the court. At present there are, I understand, 1,000 such agreements, compared with something of the order of 100,000 consent orders in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council did raise some concerns with the committee about the lack of scrutiny of parenting plans. They were not to be examined by the court to ensure that the best interests of the child were addressed. The Law Council suggested that there should be a level of what they call minimal scrutiny, such as a form 12A procedure that is already in place in relation to court orders on other matters, such as property, which often seem to be more important than children. The concern of cost was raised, but the Law Council submitted that that procedure was not expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of parenting plans, while the Chief Justice of the Family Court indicated that he did not think it was really necessary, he also indicated that he would have no objection to a registrar being required to scrutinise the parenting plans. So the committee recommended that the Family Court monitor parenting plans when filed within the registry and that a court ought to be able to make orders specifying information required to be addressed in the plan. The government rejected this approach on the basis that scrutiny would defeat the intention of this bill to facilitate greater use of non-litigious methods of settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the court scrutiny issue, the point was made that there is significant likelihood that the parenting plan procedure would significantly disadvantage what are seen as the weaker parties in various marriage situations. I guess weaker parties, in a non-sexist way, could be men or women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was argued that upon registration the plan is enforceable as a court order and there should be a requirement that the parties seek independent advice on their rights and obligations. Without it a weaker party could be disadvantaged&mdash;they could be railroaded in those negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the opposition believe that the impact of the registering of parenting plans is such both as to have an effect on children and, as a means of defining the rights and obligations of the parties to the marriage, there should be a requirement that both parties receive independent advice and at least some form of scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We accordingly proposed an amendment in the Senate following negotiations with the Australian Democrats and the government and the Senate then sought to have passed these amendments to the parenting plan provisions. The amendment requires that, before a parenting plan is registered, the parties must either have received independent advice or have developed the plan in consultation with a family or child counsellor. In addition, the amendment requires that, for registration, the plan must be accompanied by certain information that will be prescribed by the rules of the court. In determining whether to register the plan, the court must have regard, in addition to the plan itself, to the information accompanying the plan. The intention is that there be a checklist of factors for consideration by the court to highlight to the court potential problems with the plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of imprisonment of registrars was of interest to me. I thought it rather interesting that registrars could be subjected to imprisonment. The first committee report recommended that that provision be deleted. The government rejected this recommendation. The coalition believes it is not appropriate that registrars be subjected to the penalty of imprisonment and, accordingly, we supported an amendment from the Greens (WA) to substitute for the imprisonment penalty a financial penalty of up to $12,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second round of committee hearings family violence was a significant issue of concern in relation to a lack of focus in the bill on family violence and violence against women in particular. The National Women's Justice Coalition has been at the forefront of expressing these concerns. That coalition makes the point that the legislation, on its face, does not give nearly enough focus to issues of family violence. The concerns extend to all aspects of the bill and focus on primary dispute resolution and parenting plans, amongst others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That coalition suggested 12 key policy proposals which attracted the support of a wide range of community and legal organisations and women's groups. In this respect the committee recommended that, first, part III, primary dispute resolution, be amended to qualify the object of the part to encourage primary dispute resolution provided the mechanisms are appropriate in the circumstances of the case and proper procedures are followed. That is included in amendment 5. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the object of part VII, children, articulates the principle underlying the object of the part and is to be amended to include the proviso `except when it is or would be contrary to the child's best interests', and that is amendment 11. Third, section 68K, requiring courts to avoid inconsistency with family violence orders, will be redrafted in more positive terms so that the court must have regard to the safeguards in order to avoid exposure to family violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government accepted those recommendations in the amendments implementing those recommendations moved by the government and thus supported in the Senate by the coalition. However, a number of other coalition suggestions were not taken up by the government. Some of these were taken up by the Democrats. Generally speaking, the coalition was of the view that the government's response appropriately addressed those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One suggestion, however, was not accepted by the government but was moved as an amendment that, on balance, we supported. The amendment in question, amendment No. 10, added an additional factor to section 43 of the Family Law Act. Section 43 sets out the principles to be applied by the court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under the act. The amendment specifically includes a reference to the need to ensure safety from family violence. That amendment was endorsed by the Family Law Council and the family law section of the Law Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in relation to grandparents, and amendment No. 73, during the committee hearings a number of grandparents organisations strongly argued that the act should make specific reference to the rights of grandparents. They do play a vital role in the lives of their grandchildren. That role can be particularly important at a time of breakdown. To the extent that the bill helps facilitate agreement between parents in relation to their children, it is hoped that it will also facilitate agreement with respect to contact with grandparents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the parliament gives neither parents nor any other persons rights in relation to children. The bill looks at what is in the best interests of the child. It states explicitly that a principle underlying that object is that children have a right of contact on a regular basis with both their parents and with other people significant to their care, welfare and development. Of course, grandparents fall within that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the thrust of the bill in this respect. The legislative scheme facilitates, either by agreement or court order, contact or residence arrangements that are in the child's best interests. That will be best served often by regular contact with grandparents and, in some cases, by the child living with the grandparents. The bill allows persons concerned with day-to-day care, welfare and development of the child to apply for parenting orders in relation to children, and this will give most grandparents standing to be heard before the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although grandparents will have standing in fact, grandparents organisations wanted specific reference to grandparents in the bill. The committee recommended the government consider including grandparents in the standing provision, section 69C. In its response to the committee recommendations in this respect, the government indicated an amendment would not be appropriate because grandparents already have standing under the broadly worded provision. Subsequently, however, the government did agree to introduce an amendment to specifically refer to grandparents in the standing provision, and the coalition is happy to support this amendment which recognises that grandparents do play a significant role in children's lives. </PARA>

At the outset, can I also endorse his comments in relation to the role of this chamber in relation to legislation. All too often we see legislation brought back to this House amended in ways that have been suggested in this House after committee consideration in the Senate. The intransigence of the government in refusing to refer bills to committees or to invite the attention of House committees to legislation is to be deplored. We are all too often saved by the Senate, and it does this House no credit that that occurs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are just two amendments to the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 to which I want to make special reference, and then I will refer to another matter. They relate, firstly, to the need to ensure safety from domestic or family violence and, secondly, to the formal recognition of the significant role played by grandparents in their grandchildren's lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the hearings before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee there was significant concern expressed about the failure of government to legislate in relation to violence within the family. As indicated by the honourable member for Berowra, the principal proponent of these views was the National Women's Justice Coalition. As a result of the concerns expressed by the NWJC, the committee made a number of recommendations that included the provision of positive safeguards to protect the parties from family violence. Amendments incorporating most of these recommendations were moved by the government in the Senate and supported by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One suggestion made by the NWJC was moved as an amendment by the Australian Democrats and carried with the support of the coalition, despite the government's opposition. This is an amendment to the section of the Family Law Act that sets out the principles to be applied by the courts in the exercise of their jurisdiction under the act. The Democrat amendment adds a principle in terms of the need to ensure safety from family violence. This amendment was endorsed by both the Family Law Council and the Law Council of Australia. While it is only a small step in dealing with an extremely difficult but widespread problem, it is hoped that the attention of the court will be more directly focused upon family violence as a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to grandparents, there has been a lot of pressure from groups representing them to amend the act to include a specific reference to the rights of grandparents in relation to the children of a marriage. In the second reading debate on 8 November last year, I commented on parenting plans by referring to grandparents. I indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the right of the child to have the continuing involvement of both parents in the child's care and upbringing. It is a pleasing reform that this is expressly recognised in the bill. There can be no doubt that it is a great advantage to a child to have the love and care of both parents and, through them, involvement with the parents' respective families&mdash;the grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins.</PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 73 deals with grandparents explicitly. The bill states that the principle underlying the object of what is best for the child is that `children have a right of contact, on a regular basis, with both their parents and with other people significant to their care, welfare and development'. Grandparents, of course, will fall into this category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee dealt with this issue, and, as indicated by the member for Berowra, the government opposed as inappropriate an amendment that would have given specific reference to the grandparents, the argument being that the grandparents already have standing under the broadly worded provision. Subsequently, however, the government did agree to introduce an amendment to specifically refer to grandparents in the standing provision. I for one am very happy to support this because it gives greater recognition to the significant role that grandparents play in children's lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A child's concept of who the child is and its esteem can be very significantly influenced by its being the focus of attention of relatives. In this respect, grandparents can be very important. I believe this amendment will assist in ensuring that a child maintains contact with its grandparents, aunts, uncles and others, even if the marriage between the parents has entirely broken down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further matter to which I wish to refer relates, in effect, to children's rights. In a recent decision, the full court of the Family Court of Australia referred to a number of circumstances&mdash;there were 14, from memory&mdash;in which it is appropriate that a child be separately represented before the court in proceedings relating to the family of which the child is a member. This is a very important decision. It means that there is a greater recognition, within the unfortunately litigious process by which families' breakdowns are resolved, of the interest of the child being quite separate in many ways from those of either or both parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the decision is to be applauded in that respect, it is not without its practical consequences. I recently met with the directors of the various legal aid and legal services commissions when they were meeting in Perth and in Margaret River. An informal estimate by the directors of the cost to legal aid alone for representation of children in Family Court proceedings is about $6 million to $7 million per annum. In the context of very tight legal aid budgets, that represents a very significant proportion of the total funding provided by the Commonwealth in respect of what is a Commonwealth matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, given the already sparing allocation of legal aid to those seeking legal aid for the purposes of their own proceedings, not all of the needs of the children are going to be met in cases where it is appropriate. This is something that needs very close attention from the government, just as the question of the cost of representation of those accused of serious criminal offences needed attention following the decision of the High Court in the case of Dietrich. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to recognise that there is a need to deal with legal aid funding of children's representation separately from any previous consideration of that issue. It is an urgent issue that the legal aid commissions are having to deal with on a day-to-day basis already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the amendments proposed by the government. It is a matter of regret that the government did not suggest that this bill be referred to the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues for consideration. Instead, it was dealt with by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. In future with any such legislation which is of great concern across the community and to all members across all parties, I urge the government to consider that it be referred to a House committee in the first instance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of brief points particularly with regard to amendment No. 73, which is the inclusion of the recognition of grandparents and their role in the domestic situation of family break-up. The reason I want to do this is that one of my constituents, Mrs Di Underwood, has made this her personal crusade over the last 12 months with a number of different organisations across Australia. It was born out of her particular and individual experience with her own son and grandchild and the access that they have been denied and that they believe is necessary for the balanced upbringing of that child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I have maintained a close contact with Di over the last 12 months she has certainly brought to the fore a very unnerving sort of relevance to this issue as far as the depth and breadth of this problem within society is concerned.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is with great import that these amendments come back to the House of Representatives&mdash;as I think a previous speaker indicated, some 12 months or more after the Family Law Reform Bill passed through this place and went to the Senate&mdash;and are being supported by the coalition, in particular amendment No. 73 which, as I have said, is particularly important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to note the work that has been done by Di Underwood and her support group&mdash;Grandparents Rights Need Support, the GRaNS group&mdash;and I am sure the majority of government ministers that have been involved with this bill and this whole issue are aware of Di Underwood and that support group. They have done an important job, particularly in lobbying a lot of the senators who have been involved in the process of developing these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read a couple of paragraphs from a newsletter that Di Underwood circulates to the people in this organisation who have been involved in getting this amendment to the stage where it is today where it is about to pass through this chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to make is in relation to the issue of parenting plans being not only lodged with the court but also scrutinised by the court. I would simply make the point that, whilst the government has accepted this amendment&mdash;the large proportion of children who are not in any way subjected to the Family Court may be 80 or 90 per cent of children&mdash;society, of course, does not seek in any way to scrutinise the parenting arrangements between their parents. I simply think that we have injected a degree of bureaucracy into the parenting plan arrangements for no valid purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a tragedy because it may be that the parenting plan arrangements for which many people hold high hopes will not be as effective as they might otherwise have been.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When important bills such as the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill we are debating today are introduced with such haste and in such a slapdash manner, it seems only wise to speak later rather than earlier. The government has produced here two weak and complicated pieces of legislation. It should come as no surprise that they have been changed. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill is already significantly different from the draft version that was circulated for discussion. The coalition's campaign against the removal of women under 40 for eligibility for the wife pension scared the government backbench into revolt, forcing changes to the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also been embarrassed by our foreshadowed amendments to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and announced a package to assist Meridian Investment unit holders&mdash;a package, I might add, that is mean-spirited when compared with the coalition's proposals. This bill has already created a great deal of concern over its lack of detail. I trust that the coalition will be able to force a few more changes on it so that the pensioners the legislation affects will enjoy some real certainty, as opposed to the vagueness of what the government is offering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to speak for long today. However, I do want to canvass some of the aspects of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and the extended deeming provisions that have caused the greatest worry for the coalition and the community. The shadow minister, the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), has foreshadowed an amendment condemning the government for its cavalier treatment of the House by providing insufficient time for consideration of the detailed provisions of this bill. The amendment goes on to condemn the government for its failure to include details of the timing and regularity of valuation of financial investments under the extended deeming rules; for its failure to adequately warn people affected by these new measures; for its failure to assist investors in Meridian Investment Trust from unfair penalisation under the unrealised capital gains provisions; and, finally, for its failure to properly deal with the potentially adverse impact of extended deeming on the holders of investments in friendly societies. They are all points worth making, and the government should stand condemned on all counts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating measures foreshadowed in the budget six months ago but, as the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) rightly observed earlier in this debate, the devil is often in the detail. It is scarcely responsible of a government to introduce two bills containing more than 40 amendments&mdash;including the vitally important extended deeming measures&mdash;and adding up to almost 400 pages, with only eight days for detailed examination and consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow minister has remarked, we hear frequent complaints about the complexity of social security law from independent groups such as the Ombudsman and Welfare Rights. Too much social security law is bad law&mdash;law where one needs to be an expert to decipher the complexity of policies that should help, not confound, ordinary people in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Complex social security law creates difficulties every day for the people who have to administer it and for the people it attempts to assist. It ties down departments and confuses and worries social security recipients. Only last month the Auditor-General commented on how many hundreds of millions of dollars could be saved if Social Security improved its work practices and liberated its staff from the demands of paper work. Some of these were truly remarkable, such as the finding that $5 million could be saved if staff spent only five minutes less each day reading instructions. I cannot imagine that today's measures will be the first step to improve this situation. They are a perfect illustration of the way the government has created the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) like to tell us that expenditure has been cut to the bone, yet they and their colleagues are happy to dump complex legislation such as this on the House with insufficient time for consultation and improvement, regardless of the wasteful bureaucratic sclerosis that a poorly formed end product will cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 is not just a slapdash piece of legislation. It is also incomplete. It does not contain all the details necessary to introduce extended deeming. Under the new deeming rules a single pensioner will be deemed to earn a return of five per cent on financial investments worth up to $30,000&mdash;$50,000 for couples&mdash;and the balance of investments will be deemed to earn seven per cent. The government claims that this system will create certainty as pensioners' payments will not be affected by market volatility as the value of their investments moves up and down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government has failed to provide any information on how often assets are to be valued.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, pensioners are required to notify the Department of Social Security each time the value of their assets changes so that their pension can be adjusted accordingly. With the legislation in its current incomplete form they will not know what to do. One form of uncertainty is merely replaced with another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill not only fails to solve the whole problem of uncertainty but also creates a real fear that the government will take advantage of this vagueness to further disadvantage pensioners. Pensioners' deeming rates will move up and down with the value of their assets. However, the government will not let us know when these official revaluations are going to occur. It seems appropriate to ask if pensioners will be able to choose if and when they want the value of their investments revised or if revaluation will occur at a time when it will benefit the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems remarkable that the government should not have finalised these measures before presenting today's legislation to the House. It is only proper that the bill be referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee as the coalition has suggested. There is a clear need to consider issues such as the timing and regularity of valuations and the amendments necessary to institute the appropriate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The incomplete nature of this bill suggests an ad hoc approach to law making and a disregard for the parliament, let alone the pensioners who may have their incomes altered as a result. We should remember that this is an issue that can cause very significant concern, if not actual worry and distress, to pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to find hidden away in the budget papers the government's own estimation that 207,000 pensioners will suffer a decrease in pension if they do not rearrange their assets. As the shadow minister rightly observed, Social Security was able to successfully explain changes to the wife pension to its clients with some clear and helpful letters and brochures. It would have been a simple matter to do the same with this measure to pensioners with shares. If the government intends to propose changes such as these it should have the courtesy to pass on the fullest possible amount of information to the people who will be affected by its final outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it should also be noted, when considering the numbers of people affected by this move, that the government did not receive the savings originally anticipated from its treatment of unrealised capital gains. This, presumably, is one of the reasons why the government is moving to a new scheme. The revised budget forecasts that the Treasurer has said will be released some time before Christmas are already expected to show that the government's financial strategy is in tatters. One can only wonder how effective the extended deeming proposals will prove to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to briefly touch on two more matters that the coalition has raised in its amendment to these bills. The government has failed to take into account the plight of investors in Estate Mortgage who have been adversely affected by the unrealised capital gains measures. When the coalition announced its intention to exempt investors in the trust who had been disadvantaged by these rules, the government attempted to match this with an ex gratia payment&mdash;a poor substitute for our original proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues of friendly society bonds is another matter for concern coming from the haste in which this legislation has been prepared. The Australian Friendly Societies Association has suggested that prepaid investments such as friendly society bonds should be treated differently from financial products where tax is not prepaid and investors pay tax at their own marginal tax rates. The association has argued that returns from tax prepaid products will necessarily be lower as the tax has been paid before the distribution to investors and that its investors will be unfairly affected by extended deeming. For this reason we believe the Senate community affairs committee should also examine these implications of today's bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not here when the original unrealised capital gains and deeming measures were debated, but I quickly learnt from my mail bag and talking with my constituents just how controversial they had been. The coalition has long promised to repeal the unfair unrealised capital gains provisions. We have criticised the government for the way in which pension incomes can alter so much depending on the vagaries of the share market and the uncertainty and hardship that this system can cause. Today's patchy bills, and the review they will need, show that the government still has a lot to learn before it produces something workable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">I rise to speak in this cognate debate and to expand on some of the comments made by my colleague the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne). I also indicate that the way in which the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill have been introduced raises one's eyebrows. They have been introduced at a time when many people who rely on either the age pension wholly or partly or have their own investments and still qualify for an age pension spend most of their waking hours worrying themselves sick that the government is going to change the rules again and take their pension away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table, would know, we live in constantly changing times. People's perceptions of change are grossly exaggerated at times by the amount of change that appears to be going on around them at any particular time. The types of changes in the bills before us do nothing to reassure those who feel that their lives, their incomes and their opportunities for maintaining their standard of living are under challenge once again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to read the press release of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) in which he indicated, on 19 October:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments respond to the concerns of pensioners themselves about the complexity of investment rules, the frequent changes caused to pension payments and the effect on incentives to earn more from investments. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new rules are simpler, fairer and more predictable and will encourage people to make the most of their resources.</PARA>
<PARA>These comments arise from the extraordinary scenario created by the introduction of the deeming provisions in the first place. As we know from experience, and having been a campaigner against the way in which these deeming provisions were introduced in the social security legislation, there are instances where they will impact unfairly on one particular group of people who have a particular type of investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now find that, in order to allegedly simplify these arrangements, the changes have been made whereby the total value of a pensioner's financial investments will be used to calculate his or her income from those investments. A deeming rate of five per cent will apply to the first $30,000 of investments for a single pensioner, or the first $50,000 for couples. Thereafter a deeming rate of seven per cent will apply. Pensioners will receive a full pension where income from financial investments is less than $43,000 for a single pensioner or $75,000 for a couple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Sturt, who has obviously received representations&mdash;as I have and as, I imagine, many other members have&mdash;has indicated, the friendly societies have indicated some serious concerns with these changes, serious enough to cause their members some disquiet and to be destabilised or to find themselves feeling insecure about their retirement income. I must say, while we have the parliamentary secretary at the table, that this destabilisation, this constant change, has been a feature of government policy throughout its life and it has accelerated in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that, as individual members with their own electorate offices, they would be getting the same sorts of representations that I and others are getting about this sort of insecurity&mdash;the insecurity that gnaws away&mdash;which, combined with other facets of modern life, leads pensioners, self-funded retirees or those who perhaps rely on a combination of incomes from the pension and self-funded investments to become more and more destabilised or insecure. The complaints of people or organisations like the friendly societies are reflecting this basic rise in insecurity on the part of people who are pensioners or self-funded retirees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Ancient Order of Druids have indicated in their letter to me that the present or proposed deeming rates in the bill make no allowance for tax paid investments. In other words, the flat rates are set at five per cent up to 30 per cent, as I said, and seven per cent beyond. They are based on tax unpaid returns provided by banks, building societies, credit unions, et cetera. Investments like safe friendly society bonds are given no chance to compete because they are obliged to pay 33 per cent tax before bonuses are credited to the bond. That is hardly a level playing field in the competition to offer retirement income investments to likely customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 400,000 pensioners have about $2.8 billion invested with friendly societies which are asking on behalf of their members why they should be treated unfairly. What they are asking for in this case is a fair go for their members. They have indicated in their submission two ways in which they believe the matter could be resolved. The first is the setting of a tax paid equivalent deeming rate; in other words, five per cent, less 33 per cent, equivalent to 3.35 per cent. The second is giving friendly societies the option to provide their pensioner members with a tax unpaid cash paying bond, leaving the liability for tax in the pensioner's or recipient's hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The societies have asked me&mdash;and others&mdash;to make representations on their behalf. I am conscious of the fact that there is comment abroad that the friendly societies perhaps ought to be looking at offering other sorts of products to their likely members or their likely customers instead of tax prepaid bonds. That is a fair comment to a certain extent because, in many cases, pensioners are not taxpayers. They are not likely to be paying tax and, therefore, the product may not necessarily be the most suitable in their case. However, as I indicated earlier, we are dealing with people who have made investment decisions for their long-term retirement income in the hope that those decisions will be concrete decisions that will provide them with a fair standard of living throughout their retired lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Sturt has indicated, this almost dog's breakfast of legislative changes was brought in at a very late point. There has been very little opportunity for members and others to be able to examine the changes in detail and to assess how they are likely to affect people's lives. This sort of legislative process does little to nothing to contribute to a set of circumstances in which our senior citizens can lead their lives with at least some semblance of security and ability to plan ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A change that will have a fundamental effect is being proposed in relation to the retirement income of a substantial number of people. It will in one fell swoop make the friendly societies, with their tax prepaid products, uncompetitive in the retirement income competition, which involves providing products to likely customers and those seeking retirement that will give a fair return on their investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now comment on the income test treatment of Meridian Investment Trust. I refer to the press release of the Minister for Social Security on 25 October. He announces that the government decided to apply concessional income tax treatment to pensioners affected by the failure of Estate Mortgage in 1990. He points out that Global Funds Management took over the funds of the Estate Mortgage group in 1990 and consolidated them into one trust called the Meridian Investment Trust. This trust was listed on the Stock Exchange in December 1993. The listing meant that the trust comes under the rate of return rules for valuing managed investments under social security income tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until recently, the price of the stock was such that there was little impact on pensions. However, recent increases in the Stock Exchange price are now being reflected in a pension reduction and many of those concerns of the Minister for Social Security. This problem will cease to exist next July when the government's extended deeming measure will replace the rate of return rules. However, given the circumstances of the Estate Mortgage failure in 1990, there are particular features of this situation that justify concessional treatment in the meantime. The minister announced that the government has therefore decided to apply concessional income tax treatment to these investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is precisely the type of circumstance that many of us predicted in relation to the application of deeming rates in the first place. We have the somewhat invidious position that, where an investment incurs a loss during the particular period of its treatment under the deeming rate rules, there is no provision for the person who may have had a gain in the previous financial year and suffered a loss in the next financial year to get a replacement or transfer of that loss back into their retirement income. Having lost the pension as a consequence of the deemed rise in income under the deeming provisions, that pensioner would not be eligible to claim back or in any way claw back the loss from the performance of their invested income over the next ensuing financial period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Meridian, I make a plea to the minister. The investors who invested with Heine Management have understandably reported on the adverse effects to the social security benefit entitlements of many unit holders in flexi property trust. They have asked the minister for a similar extension of this treatment that Meridian Investments have enjoyed to the people who are flexi unit holders. In other words, it will allow them to obtain a change to the current unreasonable treatment of their unit holders by the DSS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first instance, during that campaign many of us undertook to try to alert the government to the likely consequences of its deeming rate provision regime. These types of anomalies are precisely the result of those changes that we predicted and they give rise to the insecurity that, as I mentioned earlier, gnaws away at the lifestyles of pensioners and those who are desperately trying to preserve their standard of living by juggling their investments so they do not affect their pension income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as younger people probably find it very hard to understand how much this type of change can eat away at the security of people who are of retirement age. But, when you think about it carefully, for people who are almost on a fixed income these types of changes can be almost the end of the world. These changes are of such magnitude in their lives that, combined with all the other things that are going on around them in the community these days, they make life miserable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who have worked throughout their lives, paid taxes and contributed to the Australian standard of living and to the way in which we have developed this magnificent country of ours find themselves in a situation where every other month there appears to be another change to the way in which their retirement incomes are being treated, one way or the other. If it is not the way the DSS is treating their incomes or their returns from their investments, it is the Taxation Office requiring them to pay provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the things that we are seen to have lumped onto our senior citizens, these changes seem to be the most insidious because they contribute to that sense of almost feeling cut off from the rest of the community. These changes appear to them to be nonsensical, bloody-minded and bureaucratic, requiring them to go through another set of hoops that have been placed in their way by the government and the government bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It probably would suit government ministers and some of the senior bureaucrats to try to mentally place themselves in the position of people in this predicament. Together, the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who has just entered the chamber, and I were campaigners when these deeming provisions were first introduced. I can recollect going to meetings where he and I would speak to groups of pensioners or people who were part-pensioners. We listened first-hand to these fears being expressed, often in a way that left us in no doubt as to how much these types of changes affected their lifestyles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that the administration of the social security system is a complex and, at times, difficult process. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), who is sitting at the table, is probably sick to her back teeth of hearing me make observations about the local office of Joondalup, although I know that she does try to conscientiously help out when these things are brought to her notice. We have a system now that is so complicated you would almost have to be a Rhodes scholar in order to understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the changes that has been proposed in the legislation that is before us today is in relation to the pensioner loans system, which is quite a lengthy piece of paperwork. That scheme is a first-rate scheme. Of all the things the government has done in recent times, that is one of the good ones. If the parliamentary secretary has had anything to do with that scheme she ought to be congratulated because it is a scheme that many have found to be most useful. It is a great idea because it allows pensioners to draw down extra income, or perhaps extra funds, from the asset value of their homes. Of course, that liability is not repayable until they pass away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a tremendous scheme to which this legislation proposes some changes. But I was quite staggered to find that many people were unaware of the scheme. I found that this unawareness was a little more widespread than I had thought. I urge the parliamentary secretary to redouble the government's effort in informing those who are eligible or likely to be eligible of what is a tremendous idea. This scheme allows people to improve their lifestyle using the asset value of their home to take a loan which is not repayable until they pass away. That is a good idea. From time to time, one can congratulate the government for good ideas. They are entitled to accept the congratulations of those who have taken advantage of it. However, the government should redouble its efforts in ensuring that everybody is conscious of what is a tremendous idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I refer to the carers pension, which is one of the many changes proposed in the bills before us today. I want to point out a particular dilemma in which a constituent found herself. Her husband suffered from chronic Alzheimer's disease and needed 24-hour supervision. Neither Mrs S nor her family wanted to send Mr S, the person suffering from the disease, to a nursing home or a big town. Mrs S is eligible for a carers pension, but she cannot cope with her husband's needs all the time. They looked around for somebody who would be prepared to come to Wiluna, which is where they live, to help care for Mr S. After four or five tries, they found a woman who was suitable and who wanted to stay in this remote location and help. Unfortunately, she was on a working visa, which meant that she could not hold down a job for more than three months at a time. To make matters worse, Mrs S could not claim a carers pension or benefit for the carer who was willing to go there because the CES required that they advertise Australia-wide to ensure that no other Australians were available to take the job. Of course, that would have required tremendous effort and would have taken many months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the type of thing you find in the grey area of social security and related legislation which requires change. I know that the parliamentary secretary will listen to my concerns and, hopefully, she will make sure that the type of dilemma facing my constituent is changed in the future. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I wish to respond to a number of points before we consider the bills in total.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In listening to the contributions of those opposite to this debate in the House, I noted that one of the points that kept coming out time and time again was the eight days for consideration of this bill in detail. When the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) got up and made his first contribution to this debate, he mentioned the eight days for consideration in detail of the bill, as did every other opposition member who followed him thereafter. I thought that was quite extraordinary. With all due respect, it got to the stage where I thought that someone had written a speech and then distributed it around. We indicated what we were going to do during the May budget. I do not know how many more months we need to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it was very interesting when the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) got up earlier and said, `But wait a minute, eight days for consideration of this bill in detail is disgraceful.' Yet I find that the original one that was circulated has amendments and changes to it. So we cannot have it both ways. Obviously, he had been given an opportunity to look at the information, along with all other opposition members, but then he came back and said that eight days was not enough. I really think that was a bit of a furphy. Those opposite should have commended and congratulated the government on the number of steps that it has taken in respect of the bills before the House to make sure that what we do is at all times give account and consideration to the people whom we want to benefit from it&mdash;that is, the pensioners and those who are disadvantaged within our society. I understand that and I can appreciate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other points that I would like to raise. One of the criticisms, if I could put it that way, of the opposition, which was again mentioned in a repetitive style, related to deeming. Just about every opposition speaker got up and condemned deeming. I do not know whether they condemned it because they do not understand it or because they just wanted to make political points from it. Obviously, if they condemned it from a political point of view, they did not give any consideration to the comments of many pensioners within our society and organisations far and wide who have commended and congratulated the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and the government on the steps that have now been taken in the simplification of deeming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others are saying, `It is some new invention.' I think one of the opposition spokespersons said, `Why have we got to have it and what are we doing with it?' We have called it extended deeming because we are building on what is already in place. In so doing, we have simplified it. We have been circulating that message to all pensioners and pension organisations for something like five months now and we will continue to do so with information going out through our pensioner newsletters and also other methods of circulation, particularly <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age Pension News</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was leading up to a couple of points on deeming. Why has the government done it? This is the ongoing point made by the opposition. We did it because we had been approached by many organisations&mdash;our pensioner income and assets test review came out of that&mdash;and people saying, `We want a deeming approach, and it is certainly preferable.' We had that reviewed and it has come into being because it is simpler. It replaces the numerous rules that originally applied to different financial assets with one set of rules. That makes it easier for people to understand and appreciate it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This system is fairer because it ensures that our clients with the same level of financial assets receive a similar assessment, no matter how their assets are invested. It is very predictable. This predictability encourages our clients to increase their total income by eliminating the risk of large changes to entitlements. By that I mean the short-term fluctuations in the market value of managed investments and shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also simplifies the choice of investments. Treating all financial assets in the same way encourages those clients with whom we are dealing, day in and day out, to choose investments on their merits instead of their likely effect on entitlements. Also, it really puts the means test system as our pensioners understand and appreciate it on a more sound, long-term footing. Of course, we need to have this in place as the population ages. One of the comments made was, `Why are we having extended deeming?' We have called it extended deeming because, as I have said, we are putting it into place and building on what is already there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other concerns were raised by the opposition regarding  financial investments, such as what deeming is going to include and what it is going to exclude. That, too, has been circulated. The information is readily available to any member on either side of the House who has a concern about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I reiterate, to make sure it is on the record for this debate today and so that we do not have these alarming statements going out to our pensioners and all of those people living on limited income, is that the financial investments do not include the individual's house or contents. It does not include the car, the boat or the caravan. It does not include the stamp or coin collection, if that is what they have. It does not include the standard life insurance policy or the holiday home, farm or other real estate. Income will not be deemed on any of these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial investments also do not include superannuation, allocated pensions, immediate annuities or allocated annuities. Actually, under the pension and allowance income test, the income from all financial investments will be assessed under one simple set of rules. That is why I continue to reiterate the fairness of the system this bill is now covering, the fairness of bringing into place a deeming that will allow people to have all of their assets fairly treated. We will not have a great differentiation between one particular group that has small savings and another that has shares, because in this legislation I believe we are looking after the interests of all of our clients&mdash;whether the opposition believes us or not. It is a fact and it has been accepted. We are creating a level playing field for people to make those investment choices. I can only reiterate that treating investments equally does encourage all of our people to select investments on their overall merits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have with me the list of those people who participated in the debate, but I say generally that a number of other comments were made that our pensioners do not understand the impact of extended deeming. Our government has directly written to all pensioners and, through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age Pension News</EMPHASIS> and other means, widely publicised the new deeming rules&mdash;well before their introduction, which, I might add, will be 1 July 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through our publicity we have stressed that our financial information officers provide a free service to all of our clients going through our Department of Social Security offices and, if there is any concern out there at large, `Don't listen to rumour, contact those people; they'll be only too happy to sit down, explain and provide the information and set out the rules for you free of charge as part of a service from the Department of Social Security.' We have found considerable interest amongst pensioners approaching our financial information officers. We have had a good community response to that information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to reiterate that deeming itself does not affect the majority of our pensioners. I would like to put an example on the record. If a single pensioner has no other income, then they can have as much as $43,000 worth of financial investments before their pension is reduced. Of course, it goes up for married couples. But the opposition is being alarmist by continually saying that people will have to stop their savings, withdraw them and change and, therefore, they are flustered and do not understand. Let me tell you: the response is that they more than understand. In fact, they are saying, `We very much appreciate what you have been able to do.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Moore (Mr Filing), just before I rose on my right of reply, said again that no-one has advised the pensioners of deeming. I think I have covered that point. I would also like to reiterate that we sent out a personal letter to some 2.3 million pensioners. Within a few days of the budget, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) sent out a similar information letter to 350,000 Department of Veterans' Affairs pensioners explaining 12 months in advance the changes that were going to occur. </PARA>

The opposition claims that no information has been provided on these bills, particularly on deeming.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I was very pleased when the Minister for Social Security announced on 25 October that concessional income test treatment would apply to pensioners and allowees affected by the failure of Estate Mortgage.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)Schedule 2, Part 2, pages 21 and 22, omit paragraph 9.</PARA>
<PARA>The matter we are dealing with first is the amendment to delete paragraph 9 of schedule 2. Paragraph 9 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the end of each financial year, each agency must give the Privacy Commissioner a report including matters relating to the data-matching program that are carried out . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the 3-year period ending on 30 June 1998, and after each successive 3-year period, each agency must give the Minister responsible for the agency a report for presentation to the Parliament including all the details relating to the data-matching program . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The reason for moving to delete that paragraph is that the opposition is of the view that the existing sunset clause ought to be maintained and that the parliament ought to be in a position to be adequately informed, particularly as to the way in which the data-matching program is being carried out. These provisions, of course, require for the data-matching program to be carried out under supervision and for certain reporting requirements to the parliament. They were part and parcel of the schema that was developed first by the Senate for ensuring that these provisions were adequately reviewed by the parliament on the basis of regular provision of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have certainly found the information that has been provided to me relating to the data-matching program comprehensive and helpful. It has enabled people to have a better understanding of how it is operating. The reason that we seek to maintain the clause relating to terminating the operation of data-matching is that we still have doubts as to how efficacious it has been. That is the reason for the approach that we have taken on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are going to come to a concluded judgment that it has shown to be extraordinarily effective, as the government often claims, then that information ought to be available for the parliament to come to that view. The fact that we have come to a view at the moment that suggests that it has not been efficacious but we are prepared to give it extra time to ensure that it is able to work is a compromise on our part. As part of that compromise, the government ought to accept the continuation of the sunset clause and the reporting requirement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for allowing us to have the amendments considered separately. I am sure that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and the opposition will agree when I explain why. I completely agree with the sentiments that have just been expressed. The amendments before us now concern two parts, which is reflected on page 21, paragraph 9, of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill. One is a deletion; the other is an addition. The addition is the reinstatement of the sunset clause, bringing it back to 1999. We have no trouble with that. In fairness and to get the bills through, if this is what is required we are quite prepared to accept it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the other clause, the honourable member for Berowra has just stated in his argument that he finds it very informative and that we should have the facility for the extension of the activity. But, in moving the amendment, he has eliminated completely the role of reporting. By eliminating paragraph 9 and not substituting anything else, he is basically saying that the participating agencies in tabling the reports in the parliament are in accordance with the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To reiterate for the honourable member, the present requirement states that agencies report annually and separately. We admit that it is costly in terms of resources, and it is probably no longer necessary to demonstrate the value of the program. But, with that in mind, and to ensure that the parliament is adequately informed about the operation of the data-matching program, the bill provides for the data-matching act to be amended to require agencies to present reports to parliament every three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra, in moving the amendment on behalf of the opposition, has basically indicated that he does not consider that the three-year reporting regime is sufficient. I have just heard the debate, accordingly, to support that amendment. We on the government side are a little puzzled by the amendment which the member for Berowra has circulated. Far from requiring annual reporting by agencies, if the amendment goes through in its form now, it will dispense with the mandatory reporting requirement altogether. I do not think that he wants that, and nor do we. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the previous reporting requirements under the data-matching act have been met. Unless further amendments are made to the act, there will be no future need for agencies to report. Paragraph 9 of schedule 2, part 2, of the carer bill seeks to amend the data-matching act so as to require agencies to report to the parliament every three years, with the interim reporting provided to the Privacy Commissioner annually. I am sure that the member for Berowra did not mean by his amendment simply to omit paragraph 9 without providing any alternative reporting requirements and to dispense with the reporting requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that many officers in the Department of Social Security, including me, would welcome that, but I do not think that is the intent of his amendment, and I do not think that is the intent of the government. We do not want to have eliminated completely the right of reporting, which is basically what this amendment would do. That is why I asked for consideration of the amendments in two parts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Schedule 6 is the schedule that I would like to speak to. I do not mean to entrap the parliamentary secretary in this matter but I have only just received advice of some concerns by Aged Care Australia in relation to the way in which the residential care allowance, which is to be implemented in schedule 6, is to be dealt with. The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that the residential care allowance is to replace rent assistance for people living in nursing homes and hostels. It states that the same rate, threshold, indexation and other arrangements will apply as now apply to rent assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People residing in nursing homes are currently paid rent assistance. This new form of payment is seen as a more appropriate way to address the circumstances of people living in residential care, while preserving the same level of entitlement. But the explanatory memorandum goes on to say that, in the longer term, the new residential care allowance is to be administered by the Department of Human Services and Health. However, in the shorter term, it will remain as a social security payment. It goes on to say that the people who will transfer from rent assistance to residential care allowance are basically those residing in nursing homes and similar accommodation which the Commonwealth supports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Aged Care Australia simply say that they have not yet been able to get detailed information as to the timetable for implementation of these changes, particularly the change to the Department of Human Services and Health. They have asked the government for discussions with peak organisations. They have also sought a response from the Department of Human Services and Health on a number of important questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They ask these questions, and I hope the parliamentary secretary may be able to answer them. The first is: will the residential care allowance be paid direct to recipients, as is the case with payment of rent assistance, under arrangements which recognise residents' rights to manage their own financial affairs, or will it be paid to service providers as part of recurrent subsidies, therefore removing an important residential right? That is a particularly poignant question. It reflects on the government's philosophy of assisting people in residential care to be able to exercise personal responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One cannot help wondering why there is a move to Human Services and Health, unless the government has in mind integrating the payment with other forms of payment that are made to the organisation itself&mdash;in other words, removing that personal responsibility. If the payment is direct to service providers, will it be regarded as folded into the service pension? If so, will the fees charged to residents be increased beyond the present 87.5 per cent for nursing homes or 85 per cent for hostels thereby reducing the residual amounts available to residents?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think they are very proper questions. I am sorry that I did not have them available to me earlier when I spoke on this matter because I would have raised them at that time.

When this change occurs will the benefit be paid direct to recipients or is it going to be in fact folded into the payments that are made to the organisation?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments that I seek to move relate essentially to the Meridian Investment Trust issue in both cases. The proposal that we have advanced, in contradistinction to the situation that the government has addressed essentially through payments of an ex gratia nature, is to in fact put the trust unit holders in the position that they would have been in were it not for the fact that Estate Mortgage Trust failed and was later relisted. The implication of that is that the approach we wish to take would see them defined as saved investments in the same way that other trusts were saved if they were established before September 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our proposal is to ensure that those folk who have these forms of market-linked investments, or Estate Mortgage trusts, are not disadvantaged by the government's unrealised capital gains test, which treats any increase in value as income for the purposes of the income test for pension eligibility. The government was obviously persuaded that these folk who owned the Meridian Investment Trust units were being disadvantaged. Otherwise, it would not have come up with the proposal for an ex gratia payment. There is no question that the case is justified. The only question is the way in which you address it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government chose to treat the holders of Estate Mortgage units, now Meridian Investment Trust units, quite appallingly. They have sought to apply to them, at this point in time, the new extended deeming arrangement, which will apply to no other holder of units or saved investments, so that the unrealised capital gains test does not apply to them. It is a distinction which clearly cannot be justified other than on the basis that it is a compromise. The government is saying that they are trying to address the problem these people face, but they really do not want to give them everything. They will deem them to have had a five per cent or seven per cent return on those holdings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very grudging and quite inappropriate. In our view, the only proper way for this matter to be addressed is for the Meridian Investment Trust to be treated as all other investments that had a continuing existence and were saved investments. The only distinction in this case is that these people had already suffered a very significant loss as a result of the failure of the trust. The government has ensured that they suffer a double jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no justification for that. It is certainly something that I do not think the government is now trying to justify, but it is trying to say, `Our ex gratia payment is enough.' I say to the government that the better way of dealing with this is to treat them as saved investments and to ensure that these people were not disadvantaged at any point in time and were not disadvantaged further by this gratuitous application of the extended deeming arrangements for the several months in which they have had capital growth. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the second veterans' affairs 1995-96 budget measures bill. It gives effect to the remaining government budget initiatives that need legislation. Many of the measures in this bill address the particular needs of our older veterans, most of whom are now in their 70s and served in World War II. In this year, while we have commemorated their achievements and sacrifices in that conflict, it is important that we continue to look at ways to improve our caring for their immediate and future needs. The initiatives in this bill, and other related measures that do not require legislation, demonstrate once again that my department is at the cutting edge of aged care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I address the specific items in this bill, I want to mention some of the government's 1995-96 budget initiatives that do not require legislation. The first is the extension of the free advisory and referral services of the very successful veterans' home maintenance helpline. This service will now be available to all veterans, war widows and war widowers. It provides a valuable support to those who own their own home by providing advice on a broad range of matters, from replacing a fuse to installing a new bathroom. Wherever possible, the helpline links the client to government subsidised services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second valuable supporting initiative is the development of a program for discharge planning. This program will ensure that appropriate care continues after an eligible veteran, war widow or war widower is discharged from hospital. The program recognises that attention to the special needs of patients in the post-acute phase of an illness is important to their successful rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who provide full-time care for our veterans play an invaluable role. They allow many veterans to continue to live in their own home or in the community when they would otherwise be unable to manage. The carer's task is often a difficult one. My department is continuing to look at ways to assist the carers. Recently I was pleased to launch a practical guide for carers of people with dementia. Other initiatives to provide practical assistance to carers are being developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the support for those providing care in the veteran community is through the provision of carer service pensions. This bill includes a number of measures that extend access to carer service pensions and it also puts into place a number of changes that reflect the needs and situations of many carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carer service pensions are now available only to those who are caring for veterans who receive a service pension. The bill extends eligibility for a carer service pension to those who are caring for certain veterans who do not receive an income support payment from either my department or the Department of Social Security. If the carer meets other existing eligibility criteria, a carer service pension will become payable to a person providing care for a veteran whose family income is less than $61,020, with assets of less than $559,250. These limits will rise in line with increases in the family payment income and assets tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar extension of carer benefits will be made to war widows and war widowers who provide care for another person. These carers will be eligible for an income support supplement if the person under care does not receive a service pension from my department or a pension or benefit from the Department of Social Security but does meet the basic family payment income and assets tests.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill removes the current requirement that allows a carer service pension to be paid only where the carer lives in the same house as the person receiving care or adjacent to that house. As long as the person provides the necessary level of care, it will not matter where the carer lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important budget measure in this bill is the continuation of the carer service pension for 14 weeks after the veteran is admitted permanently to a nursing home or other institutionalised care. The carer service pension currently ceases as soon as the veteran permanently enters a nursing home. The continuation of the payment to the carer will allow that person time to adjust to changed responsibilities and to make arrangements for their future income and possibly a new place to live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill ensures that those receiving or providing community care are not financially disadvantaged by entering into that arrangement. If a person leaves their home to provide care for a veteran, the value of their home will be disregarded under the service pension assets test for two years. Similarly, if the veteran leaves his or her home to receive care in some other place in the community, the value of the veteran's home will not be included as an asset for two years. In addition, those leaving their home to provide or to receive care will be immediately eligible for rent assistance if they are paying rent for their new residence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the change in rent assistance I just mentioned, this bill contains a number of other rent assistance measures. From March 1996, the maximum rates of rent assistance for families with children will be increased by $5 a fortnight. This increase reflects the higher cost often associated with renting private accommodation that meets the needs of families with children. The government also recognises the extra costs incurred by a single pensioner raising a child and, in this bill, increases the rate of guardian allowance by $4 a fortnight. The bill increases rent thresholds by $5 a fortnight to coincide with the March 1996 CPI increase. This increase ensures that rent assistance continues to target pensioners who pay relatively higher rents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are currently a number of pensioners who retained eligibility for rent assistance, or for a beneficial rate of rent assistance, that they were receiving at the time of rent assistance reforms in 1989 and 1993. These people have continued to receive a higher rate of income support than others who are assessed under current provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes two specific provisions relating to these pensioners. First, it ensures that those income support pensioners eligible for one of these retained rent assistance payments who transfer back to my department from the Department of Social Security can continue to receive that payment. Second, the retained payments are to be gradually phased out. From March 1996, any CPI increase in the total service pension payments will be offset against those rent assistance payments until the total amount payable is equal to the total amount payable to others in the same circumstances. This change will achieve equity in income support payments without reducing the total amount paid to the pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the payment of a residential care allowance to certain pensioners in a nursing home or hostel. The allowance replaces any rent assistance now paid to these pensioners. It will be paid at the same rate and subject to the same threshold, indexation and all other provisions as are now applied to rent assistance. The bill also includes two measures to assist veterans and other income support beneficiaries under veterans' affairs legislation in the management of their living expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will allow certain specified classes of deductions to be made from service pensions at the request of the pensioner. This will allow payments, such as rent to government housing authorities, to be deducted and paid direct to the authority. This arrangement will provide a valuable service to veterans and other income support recipients, particularly our aged and infirm pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second measure will allow certain service pensioners access to an advance of their pension of up to $500 to assist them to meet unexpected living expenses. The government recognises that many service pensioners have limited cash reserves and can have difficulty obtaining access to lump sum amounts to help them meet costs associated with, say, emergency repairs and replacements. The lump sum advance of pension will have no interest or other charges. Repayments will be at a level the pensioner can afford, and can be spread out over six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget provided for an adjustment to be made to the bereavement payment to the partner of a person who was also receiving a war widow or war widower pension at the time of death. The adjustment removes the limitation on the amount of the war widow or war widower's income support pension from the calculation of the bereavement payment to the surviving partner. The bill gives effect to this adjustment within a major rewrite of the veterans' affairs legislation relating to bereavement payments. This rewrite includes some minor policy changes to remove superfluous provisions or to correct inconsistencies. The new provisions significantly simplify what had become very complex legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes a number of minor changes to other acts. The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 is to be changed as a consequence of the introduction of the residential care allowance and the rewrite of the bereavement payment provisions in this bill. That act will also include changes that follow on previous veterans' affairs legislation amendment acts. These changes include the introduction of income support supplement, and the repeal of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940. There are also minor changes to the Fringe Benefits Tax (Application to the Commonwealth) Act 1986 as a result of the repeal of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940. The Social Security Act 1991 is to be amended to incorporate a provision relating to rent assistance to social security pensioners or beneficiaries that is now included in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, but is being repealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I believe this bill provides sound and positive measures that respond to the changing needs of the veteran community. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to speak on behalf of the opposition in response to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1995-96 Budget Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1995. Before I do so&mdash;I am not sure I have had the opportunity to do so before&mdash;I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) on his life membership of the RSL, which I am sure was well deserved. Indeed, as we have celebrated Australia Remembers this year, it has been a very good year for the minister. I think he perhaps might regret having taken on the mantle of Minister Assisting the Treasurer for Superannuation. He has already found that that is rather more complex and fraught with danger than being Minister for Veterans' Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In safeguarding the interests of veterans and our older citizens, one has to realise how important their savings are to them. I think the suggestion that some pressure should be applied to superannuation funds to do other than act in the best interests of their policyholders and shareholders is one that would be of great concern&mdash;not only to people who are already retired and are living off their savings but perhaps also to those who are planning to do so in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pleasure in these veterans' affairs debates to actually have the minister in parliament. We very rarely see the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) in here&mdash;he is always represented by his parliamentary secretary. We have just dealt with complex social security legislation, but we never get a chance to actually deal directly with the minister on such legislation. In fact, we never even get a letter from the Minister for Social Security. In every representation I make on behalf of constituents to the minister, I get a letter back from his parliamentary secretary. So I do not even know whether he can sign his name. But, to the credit of this Minister for Veterans' Affairs, he comes into the parliament when his legislation is debated, takes part in the debate and makes a contribution to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not oppose this particular legislation. We understand it is the second and final bill covering the 1995-96 budget measures for veterans. I will not go through the provisions again as the minister spelt them out in detail, but we accept that the vast majority of the provisions in this legislation do benefit veterans. The legislation is intended to bring the Department of Veterans' Affairs' beneficiaries into line with those who receive their benefits from the Department of Social Security. That, generally, is a principle with which we also agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some savings in this legislation and they result from a small increase in the rent threshold. When this matter came up in the debate on the social security legislation, we expressed some concerns about that. I am not sure whether the minister alluded directly to that change in his remarks, but that particular change will disadvantage some people while it will advantage others. However, the net effect of that change, as represented by the savings which the government projects as a result of that change, clearly makes the point that some people in receipt of rent assistance will actually receive less assistance while others will receive more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle of bringing DVA beneficiaries into line with DSS beneficiaries raises an important fundamental issue about benefits for veterans. Whilst I would not argue that veterans should not get equal benefits with DSS beneficiaries where they are not getting those benefits, the point needs to be made time and again in debates on veterans' affairs in this place about the special treatment to which veterans are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over many years there has been a concern that veterans' entitlements have been diminished little by little&mdash;a trend I would like to see stop. I do not entirely blame this last 13 years of Labor government for that because I think it started before that, but it has certainly continued. Like today, very often it is only minor changes with which we are confronted. However, the net effect of them all over a long period of time has been a dramatic lessening of the benefits that our veterans get. Talking about benefits for veterans, these are `earned' benefits&mdash;things that they have given for, that they have sacrificed for, and therefore they are benefits that in many ways should be regarded as sacrosanct and not diminished. I had a constituent write to me just recently who made the point, very poignantly, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the war ended in 1945, a 100 per cent war pension was equivalent to the average wage paid to a clerk in the Commonwealth Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously a benchmark was intended at that time. But he goes on in some detail to illustrate that now, over many years&mdash;and he mentions both Labor and conservative governments&mdash;those particular entitlements are very much less than that benchmark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He asked me what I was going to do about it. I was not able to say that we on this side would be able to return the benefit, or any of those other benefits that they originally had. But I certainly did say to him that I could give him assurances that a coalition government will be committed to maintaining veterans' benefits and that I would continue to do my utmost in the parliament to ensure this happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making there is that whilst this legislation is intended to bring DVA beneficiaries into line with DSS beneficiaries&mdash;and, as I say, that is a principle which one cannot agree with&mdash;if you turn it around the other way, the important point I want to make, the point I make at every opportunity when I speak on veterans' affairs matters in parliament, and not only the government but all members of this parliament should keep making the point, is that veterans are special, that their entitlements are special and that they should not be diminished lightly or capriciously. Over the years we have sometimes seen this being chipped away, little changes here and there which, over a long period of time, have had the effect of diminishing benefits to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people, of course, have earned those entitlements through the service they have given to this country. That is what this particular year of Australia Remembers has been all about. We in this place do not pay credit lightly to a member on the other side, but certainly the Minister for Veterans' Affairs at the table today is largely responsible for the fact that it has been a very good year, that Australia Remembers has been a success and that it has highlighted in many respects the concerns of veterans. Hopefully it will have created a climate whereby veterans' affairs will continue to be regarded as very important, not only by the members of this parliament but by the people in the community at large, and particularly by younger people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, the emphasis of Australia Remembers has been on educating young people in Australia, and many young people I think have had the benefit, during the Australia Remembers year, of perhaps understanding more fully than they have ever understood before what actually went on in Australia in those dark years between 1939 and 1945. To the extent that the minister has overseen this particular year and largely been responsible for the success of it, he deserves congratulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the important point that needs to be made in the context of this legislation is that we in this place ought always be concerned to ensure that benefits for veterans are in no way diminished. In fact, in opposition it is easy to argue that they should be enhanced, but the important thing that we ought to accept as a starting point is that they should be no further diminished. By and large, this particular legislation advantages veterans to the extent that it brings them into line with Department of Social Security beneficiaries, and for that reason the opposition does not oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other matter in the broad context of veterans' affairs that I want to raise while the minister is here is the concern that still exists in New South Wales about the downgrading of care to veterans and war widows as a result of proposed changes to the domiciliary nursing service. Some time ago I raised this matter in a veterans' affairs debate, and the minister at the time kindly picked up the point and corresponded with me in some detail about it. I raise the matter again because, despite the assurances he gave me in the particular letter he wrote, I am not yet convinced that there is not still a real concern here. Certainly the nurses in the private sector in New South Wales are still telling me that they are concerned, and I share their concern about the potential impact that this may have on 7,000&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the issue that was raised yesterday by the minister assisting me on superannuation is an important one&mdash;that is, that foreign debt has to be seen against a growing pool of superannuation assets. Of course, we all know that superannuation assets are going to grow very strongly in the future. They will probably double in the next five years and grow to about a trillion dollars by 2010 and a couple of trillion by the year 2020.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that we have rapidly growing superannuation funds coming through the system which this government has put in place. That certainly will do wonders for improving our savings performance.

He made that point specifically in the speech and, as I have made clear many times over the course of this year, it is not government policy to give directions as to where superannuation assets should be invested. That is a matter for the funds themselves to decide in terms of what they see as an appropriate investment under the obligations that the trustees have to invest to the best benefit of the members. That is the overriding obligation on the trustees and we will not be directing them in a way that would interfere with that overriding right; we will not be directing them at all in terms of where to invest their funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that we cannot encourage them to invest in certain ways, and various statements have been made about that. They have been an indication of government concern to see investment in some areas, but not a direction by the government in a form which compels superannuation funds to invest in any particular way. Whether superannuation funds want to invest to take up particular debt instruments that might be available through a refinancing arrangement is a matter for them to decide. If they believe that is an appropriate form of investment, that is open to them. It would be one possible form of investment, but there is a multitude of possible forms of investment. If they want to invest that way, that is open to them.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3332" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. It raises an important issue. As members are aware, interest rates, particularly home mortgage interest rates, are something that the community generally takes a great interest in. Of course, since the end of last year there has been a downward drift in the average mortgage rate of interest paid, as shown by the fact that on the stock of loans the average rate at the end of December last year was 10.01 per cent and in September this year, the latest figures we have, it was 9.67 per cent. So we have seen this downward drift. People might say, `How can that be with the variable rate at 10 1/2 per cent?' That is because there are other rates, which are increasingly important in terms of the total volume of mortgages, which are not on the bank variable rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect, fixed rate loans are of growing importance. They account for about one-quarter of outstanding mortgages, and the rate of a three-year fixed mortgage fell from 10.3 per cent in December of last year to 9.6 per cent in September, reflecting falling interest rates in the bond market. So we have had a considerable decline in the rates of fixed rate loans. The loans need not be fixed for just three years; they can be for two years, three years or five years. But all of them have been coming down based on that falling interest rate in the bond market. At present, home buyers on a three-year fixed rate mortgage can get a loan at 9 1/4 per cent, so considerably less than the 9.6 per cent in September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major influence on this decline in interest rates has been the impact of new entrants to the home lending market. These include mortgage originators such as Aussie Home Loans, which I am sure most members are familiar with, as well as new lenders backed by superannuation funds, life insurance companies and even the RACV in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of strong regional banks and the conversion of some building societies into banks have also added to the level of competition. The mortgage originators are offering variable rate mortgages at on average around 1 1/4 percentage points below those of the major banks, so they are on average around 9 1/4 per cent instead of 10 1/2 per cent, and some individual lenders are offering loans at rates below nine per cent. The superannuation members home loan scheme established by the National Mutual company with a number of industry funds is lending money for home loans at 8.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These new lenders are posing a major threat to the market position of the major banks. The first reaction of the banks has been to try to remain competitive in the new home loan market while protecting the margins on their existing stock of loans. You have the so-called honeymoon rates, which apply to about 20 per cent of the outstanding mortgages&mdash;essentially the first year of a loan. Those rates are around 2 1/2 per cent less than the 10 1/2 per cent variable mortgage rate. At present they are around 7.9 per cent. Just a couple of days ago, Advance Bank announced that it would reduce its honeymoon rate to 7 3/4 per cent. Through this way, through the honeymoon rate, we can see a considerable reduction in mortgage interest rates for those new home buyers coming in in their first year. It is possible for people&mdash;perhaps through threatening to go off to a mortgage originator&mdash;to have the bank continue that loan or some other discounted loan to keep them in their books. I am sure members are not unfamiliar with circumstances in which that has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reports that the major banks are launching new mortgage companies offering no-frills, budget-priced home loans. Once again, this is an attempt to compete directly with the mortgage originators in the new home loan market, while protecting the margins on their loans to existing customers. This policy has been one of trying to compete with the mortgage originators in respect of the new home buyers, whilst protecting the rates that they are charging on the existing stock of mortgages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That becomes an increasingly difficult tactic to pursue. We finally saw a breakthrough in that yesterday with the announcement by St George Bank that they are going to cut their variable mortgage rate by 0.5 per cent for customers who have had mortgages for over five years, taking that rate to under 10 per cent. That, of course, is a very significant move. I think that is the beginning of a number of cuts that we will see in variable mortgage rates. Other banks will be forced by competition to make similar cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have Mr Haydn Park of the National Australia Bank saying that his bank `could not rule out similar loyalty rate cuts'. We have Westpac saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . rewarding customer loyalty is important and this [cutting rates] is one of many good ways to do it. We are also looking at ways to do so.</PARA>
<PARA>We have seen a couple of banks going on the record today to say that they are looking closely at cuts in their rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have therefore is a situation where competition in the banking industry, which is itself much more competitive than it ever was before this government came into office, plus the new players in the game&mdash;the mortgage originators and other companies like superannuation companies and life insurance companies that are getting into the mortgage business&mdash;are putting enormous pressure on the banking industry to reduce its overall home loans. We have seen that in respect of the honeymoon rates in particular but now we are starting to see it in respect of the stock of loans. We can clearly expect that there will be further cuts in variable mortgage rates as this competitive factor continues to bite.</PARA>

There is no clearer principle of ministerial accountability than the one which states that any person who misleads this parliament is not fit for office. Therefore, if they will not resign, they should be dismissed by the Prime Minister. For that reason, it is absolutely essential that questions going to accountability, whether a person has misled this parliament and the public and whether a person has sought to deceive the public are proper questions to be put in question time and to be allowed by Mr Speaker. </PARA>

The fact is you have given us not one iota of explanation why a question that was valid yesterday should today be invalid and ruled out of order. Regardless of the further points I am about to make, this ruling ought to be dissented from on that very simple point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People will ask themselves, `What has happened between yesterday and today that would make you have an entirely different attitude?' Surely we won't be able to draw the conclusion that it suits the government's political convenience to try to shut this down. We would be very disappointed if there was any suggestion whatsoever that this was just a low tactic from the government because this minister looks very fragile. Yesterday, when this minister was asked some very basic questions she was unable to answer them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal with the second objection, which now presumably forms the basis of your claim that this question is out of order. What you have said presumably relies on standing order 142, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which the Minister is officially connected, to proceedings pending in the House, or to any matter of administration for which the Minister is responsible.</PARA>
<PARA>I have here a legal opinion which you thought suited your convenience. It is a legal opinion prepared on this very point. It has actually been tabled in this chamber. It is dated 22 August 1995 and it is from none other than the Solicitor-General, Gavan Griffith. Let me refer you to the fourth paragraph of this legal opinion. I will read the whole thing so that the point is not lost on anybody. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To avoid this difficulty, and in order to enable payment to be made . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Let me pause there. This is the payment to be made out of taxpayers' funds for the minister's legal expenses&mdash;the expenses specifically relating to her challenge to the jurisdiction of the Marks royal commission. The advice goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To avoid this difficulty, and in order to enable payment to be made out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance for legal expenses as they are incurred (with that payment subsequently confirmed by formal appropriation), reliance may reasonably be had on the alternative source of legal authority in paragraph 4(4)(b) for the payment as a benefit `afforded by the Government to a Minister for the purpose of carrying out functions as a Minister'.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the public acknowledgment by those initiating and supporting the Marks Commission, as well as those opposing it, that the matters being inquired of are directed to the issue of Dr Lawrence's continuing fitness for public office as a Commonwealth minister, these matters are open to be regarded by Cabinet as directly relevant to her continuing to carry out her functions as a minister.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the government's legal advice. This is part of their defence of the appropriation of public funds for the minister's legal expenses. In the light of that legal opinion, how can you then claim, as you do, Mr Speaker, in support of your ruling, that this matter is beyond those public affairs with which the minister is officially connected? The whole basis of the argument in support of the paying of her legal fees is in fact that those affairs are directly related to her functions as a minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, Mr Speaker, this is a complete and absolute repudiation of the basis of your ruling. You do not have a leg to stand on. Quite frankly, if you wanted to do the right thing, you would now ask me to take my seat and you would admit that you are wrong. Unless this was a High Court judgment, there is no more conclusive repudiation of your claim. Given that fact, we are therefore entitled to ask: on what basis could this ruling possibly be made?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, once your explanation for the ruling is made and rejected, I am afraid we are going to have to hunt around and see what other reasons there might be, given that that one is entirely without foundation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition tactics committee, Mr Speaker, has made a silly mistake in the question that they put before you. In being careful in the past in the way in which they have asked questions about this when they have actually attempted to relate it to issues of fitness for office, or attempted to relate it to the opinions of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) on whether or not she believes that a certain standard of behaviour is required of ministers in a contemporary context, they have at least kept a fig leaf of connection with standing order 142&mdash;and that is why your generous interpretations of standing order 142 in the past on this matter have been totally applicable and properly upheld. Let us remind ourselves of what standing order 142 says. It says this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which he is officially connected, to proceedings pending in the House, or to any other matter of administration for which he is responsible.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, it is a standing order which has generally been adhered to over the years very strictly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These standing orders were not written by this government, nor might I say&mdash;because they were canvassed in the course of debate in a manner critical of you&mdash;were the standing orders relating to relevance in answers written by this government. These standing orders were last revised in detail both as to the relevance area and generally on the way in which the questions under standing orders have related by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who sits over there doing those revisions of those standing orders, and we have not altered them. We have implemented them and Speakers, including yourself, have implemented them with a slightly higher degree of generosity than has been the case in our experience of Liberal Party Speakers in opposition&mdash;and I still have been here long enough to be able to remember them&mdash;but, nevertheless, fairly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you actually go to the very questions that were asked yesterday that you permitted under standing orders and the question asked specifically here today, you get both the answer as to why you ruled this one out and not them and you also get the answer as to why that particular set of opinions which goes to fitness to office, which of course does legitimise questions to the Minister for Human Services and Health&mdash;you get an argument around the royal commission&mdash;that rules some questions in order if you sustain your argument within it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Wooldridge's question yesterday was referred to by the opposition spokesman on parliamentary matters, the manager of opposition business. I will go to his arguments because at least he made a fig leaf attempt at addressing the standing orders in this regard as opposed to the meretricious player that kicked off the debate, who made absolutely no attempt whatsoever and thought he could get up with his usual 20 minutes of calumny and not be interrupted during the course of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, to go to the questions asked yesterday, the conclusion of question No. 1 from the honourable member for Chisholm was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is it your position that lying when holding high public office does not matter?</PARA>
<PARA>That went to a question, that was obviously immediately relevant, as to the conduct of affairs in the portfolio of the honourable member. Then it goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as the Prime Minister considers lying no disqualification for office in his government, what reason is there to think that any other minister in the government is more honest than you are?</PARA>
<PARA>I must say that that was skating on pretty thin ice, but at least it had some element of relevance. Then the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) went on to request of her that she put her interests over those of her Labor colleagues behind her. In descending order, that last one was very close to the edge, but at least they went to questions of contemporary administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what was this question? This question said, `Can you explain the motives of a set of members, X, Y, Z'&mdash;full stop, end of story&mdash;not `Does that relate to your fitness to hold public office; does that relate to whether or not you believe ministers ought to be truthful before parliament; does that relate to whether or not there is some other aspect of the activity of the royal commission that challenges whether or not you ought to be in office?' It was simply this: `What is your opinion of X, Y, Z'&mdash;full stop, end of story. There was no remote effort to make a connection between that and the issues that are matters of debate here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know it is extremely difficult for people who watch question time in the parliament or who watch parliamentary proceedings generally to understand or contemplate the standing orders under which debate takes place in this place or under which questions are asked in this place. They are in fact the product, over time, of a series of intricately devised standing orders that require certain forms at certain times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I can recollect, when I happened to be a backbencher confronted with the issues of whether or not questions were relevant, that I would get up and ask a question, and Billy Snedden, the Speaker of the day, would simply say, `Out of order'&mdash;no explanation. Criticism went to you, Mr Speaker, for example, that you had failed to give an appropriate explanation for your ruling. I must inform the honourable member, and I thought he would have known this, that you are not obliged to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recollect, at the time I was ruled out of order on a number of occasions by Speaker Snedden, I did not stand up in parliament and grizzle my head off about whether or not Billy Snedden was a fair Speaker. I went to the whip and said, `Why does this outrageous old buzzard rule me out of order?' The response of the whip as to why that outrageous old buzzard had ruled me out of order was that I was. There was a simple, competent performance by the whip and the tactics committee to tell me, `Look, old son, you've got it wrong; you were probably trying to ask a question about something that you were entitled to ask a question about, but you just did it the wrong way and that is all there was to it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least we as an opposition used to sit down and cop it when we were wrong. We didn't get up smarting and puking as the opposition has on this particular matter, saying `Somebody has taken our bat and ball away; let's give the umpire a bit of a whack behind the ear; don't let ourselves go through a bit of self-criticism on this and say, "Hang on, we got away with those three questions yesterday; why didn't we get away with the one today? This has been a Speaker who has been prepared to treat us very generously on this as the months have gone by as far as these discussions are concerned; is it just possible that, in the circumstances where we have been entitled to ask 30-odd questions on this matter and we finally find ourselves not entitled to ask one&mdash;the one question being `What is your opinion of the views of X, Y and Z'&mdash;full stop, end of story, no relationship to anything&mdash;it just might be that for once the question might be out of order?"'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now you have got to talk to your whips again and get an understanding of relevance here. Take a look at the questions you asked yesterday, which included words like, `Is it your position that lying when holding high public office does not matter?', which goes very close to a question of opinion. You could perhaps well argue that you are entitled to know the views of ministers of the Crown as to what they view as acceptable standards of conduct in regard to their holding of office.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Your others are teachable, Alexander, but you are not. That we do know on this subject, so I cannot respond to your interjection.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another thing that you ought to comprehend. Speakers do not simply act off their own bat as far as these issues are concerned. A prudent Speaker will consult the clerk regularly on the subject of what is or is not in order, particularly when handling sensitive matters. You are on a fine line as to whether you are breaching standing order 142. You may assume&mdash;I say this without knowing&mdash;that because there have been these matters which skate along the edges of standing order 142, the Speaker has been diligent in consulting the clerk and those who have the collective memory of this place as to what goes over the line and what does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you have had 30 questions ruled as though they do not go over the line and then one is ruled the other way, the possibility might be that in his head the Speaker holds a very detailed view about what is and is not appropriate in standing orders on this and has thought that through very carefully. If you take it a point beyond that and actually go to the question itself, the answer will strike you like a silver bullet as to why that would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the heads of oak of those opposite will be penetrated by that silver bullet. They will find that a vague question that has been put down in this regard would be out of order and out of order for two reasons. It is, purely and simply, an opinion. `What is the motivation of X, Y and Z before that royal commission?' It just might be possible that the Speaker might get it into his head that that is purely and simply a request for an opinion, which is not permitted outside the person's portfolio. You might just get it into your head that this question was not portfolio related and not standards related or anything else. The dawning of wisdom on this matter might just get through to you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you look at the rest of the question for some relationship between any answer on that and, specifically, any matter related to holding high public office, which was the question of yesterday but not in question today, it might just strike you that perhaps the old tactics committee&mdash;all the folk that we hugely pay here, the brains trust of our front bench, the collective genius of the Liberal Party&mdash;has come to a point where it forgot to add the coda. Perhaps it has got to the point where it might have had something wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an absolute waste of the time of this parliament. What would have been sensible for the opposition, when they heard that, would have been for them to have comprehended immediately why the question was out of order. Any person on our front bench could work out at least a dozen ways to get that question up that made it specific in a way that came within the framework of the rulings that you have made to this point. You would have actually gone back and said, `I am sorry, Tim has been made a patsy of again. The Liberal Party people who wrote his question for him a la Sinclair's suggestions about him have sent him over the hill to be shot to pieces yet again, which is becoming a depressing habit on the part of the Liberal Party as far as these matters are concerned.' It might just have grabbed them that perhaps they ought to have gone back and got a National Party bloke to have drafted it so that he was not humiliated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, as far as this question is concerned, you are absolutely correct in your ruling. These are smarting, playground tactics, wasting the time of this parliament. The question could have been got up in another way, instead of the spurious way in which it was raised, if they had wanted to do so. No harm would have been done and the parliament could have proceeded. But their idiocy, which they now attempt to cover by a 45-minute debate, deserves the dismissal it will get. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. Can the Assistant Treasurer inform the House of the benefits flowing to the Australian economy from the launch of the national competition policy? Is there any chance that the benefits of the competition policy will not be realised?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. The signing up by all governments to the national competition policy in April was a triumph for this federal government because only a federal Labor government, which has a national structure and a national vision, could have achieved such an outcome. The opposition, made up of state based parties all with their own agendas, could never ever have achieved the outcome that we achieved in April.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the significant achievement of the Prime Minister in Osaka at the weekend in lowering external trade barriers, it was important that we also lower internal trade barriers in Australia. The national competition policy achieves this, particularly in the areas of electricity, gas and transport. It has been estimated by the Industry Commission that the national competition policy has benefits to the Australian economy of around 5.5 per cent of GDP, or $23 billion. They are reforms that are really worth having.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second part of the question, Mr Speaker, there is a real chance that the benefits of the economic reform may not be realised. I refer, of course, to the election of a federal coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To implement economic reform you have to understand it, you have to understand the world in which the Australian economy operates, and you have to have the capacity to implement it. The Leader of the Opposition has already demonstrated that he does not understand it because in a press release some time ago, when dealing with the union-busting exercise on the Fremantle wharf, he said that it went to the heart of the Hilmer reforms. Of course, it had nothing to do with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that was not bad enough, this morning the Leader of the National Party proved that he did not have a clue about it either. He said, `The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission`s powers concerning wheat exports should be ringbarked'.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House censures the Minister for Human Services and Health for her failure to resign following the findings of the Marks Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>I have moved this censure motion when I have for one very simple reason: that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has been given ample opportunities today and yesterday to explain. She has been indicted in a way that no other minister in post Second World War Australian federal politics has. She is a minister whose reputation has been systematically dismantled by a royal commission and is a person whose political reputation and integrity has been destroyed, not by the actions of the Western Australian Liberal government but by the actions of her own former Labor colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that we bring on this motion when we do is that, during the past couple of days, the minister and the government have had ample opportunity to explain to the parliament and, through the parliament, to the Australian people why it is that Marks got it wrong; why it is that her former Labor colleagues got it wrong; and why, in defiance of all convention and all semblance of the basis of our Westminster system, this utterly discredited minister should choose to cling to office. It is in defiance of one of the most damning findings that any minister could have had brought against her. The real nub of this whole issue&mdash;and it is not the nub of the Marks royal commission&mdash;about her fitness to remain in office is summed up in a paragraph in the Marks royal commission. Commissioner Marks said in paragraph 4.1.5:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A remarkable feature of the evidence of the fourteen witnesses was that none had an interest in falsifying the essential thrust of what he or she said.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Commissioner Marks was talking about something that goes to the very substance of this whole debate: that none of the 14 people who gave evidence against Carmen Lawrence in the royal commission had a vested interest in falsifying their evidence. If anything, they had a vested interest in giving evidence that would support her, because they were former Labor colleagues. Minister, you had taken the same oath or affirmation; you had stood shoulder to shoulder in the same government. These were not Liberals who were bringing you down; these were not Liberals who were calling you a liar&mdash;an accusation that has been substantiated by the royal commissioner&mdash;these were Labor colleagues of your own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that Kim Beazley gets very nervous every time we read out the list. Let's see whether the puppet is still activated. Let's see whether Billy Bunter over there is still sensitive to what is being said. I will read out the names again. Let me make it clear that the context in which I use these names is very important in that it was the words, the evidence and the blowing of her cover by Keith Wilson that really led to the foundation of this royal commission. I have to say to you, Minister, that you have been found guilty of what can only be described as the Watergate syndrome. Everybody in Australia knows that you conspired to lodge that petition. You know it; your former Labor colleagues know it. If you had had the guts to stand up in the Western Australian parliament three years ago and admit that you had made a mistake, your reputation would not now be in tatters. </PARA>

Bob Hawke demanded the same of John Brown, although the latter did not deliberately mislead the public; he did it inadvertently. In other words, the whole basis of the defence that has been mounted of you is that in some way this has been a conspiracy against you by the Liberal Party.

None of those people conspired with Richard Court or John Halden. They have never met Keith Wilson. I do not think I have met any of them. I may have met Jim McGinty in passing.

He said on page 60 of his finding:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.2.9<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lawrence clearly fabricated the later discussion thesis as a device for nullifying Wilson's contention without accusing him of lying, which was potentially damaging politically. Wilson commanded a degree of respect. She gambled against the emergence of evidence which put paid to the suggestion that the same conversation occurred after the petition was tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.2.10<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lawrence even more clearly told an untruth to the Press Club at Canberra on 19 April 1995 when she said that she knew on Wednesday, 4 November that she would be exonerated in regard to the imprest account:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . . I clearly want to debunk the claim that I seized on this petition as a way to deflect attention from a police inquiry into my imprest account.</PARA>
<PARA>This is terrific stuff, a police inquiry into an imprest account of a Premier of a state. Terrific stuff! She continued:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that by the day before the tabling of the petition I was already aware that the inquiry was completed and that I would be exonerated and I checked that detail with the lawyer involved yesterday."</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Marks goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.2.11<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the day before the tabling of the petition Dr Lawrence could not have been `already aware' that she would be exonerated because the decision not to charge her was not made by the Police Commissioner until the day following the tabling.</PARA>
<PARA>No wonder you were not prepared to confirm that statement to the parliament. You knew when you were asked that question in the parliament that the statement you had made to the press club was wrong, as well you knew the statement you made to the Western Australian parliament was wrong. You knew that if you repeated that statement you confirmed your earlier untruth before that dispatch box, and not even a person who is so insensitive to standards in public life as the Prime Minister would have the barefacedness to defend you and stand beside you as a minister. </PARA>

Although it was entitled `the Royal Commission into the Use of Executive Power', one of the few findings at the opening was that there was no use, let alone abuse, of executive power. To act on its findings, as I have said, would be to condone that abuse of executive power, which was not examined or allowed to be questioned about in the royal commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the conduct of that commission was gravely flawed. I have already given some indication of that and I will outline that further. It lacked procedural fairness and the report itself was highly tendentious and virtually devoid of any rigorous analysis. For example, the evidence of the former Western Australian Attorney-General, which basically confirms mine, was dismissed as if he did not know what he was saying. He said very clearly that he does not recall at any cabinet meeting ever this matter being discussed. His evidence is dealt with in approximately half a paragraph. Similarly, other staff who disagreed with some of those members of my staff who said that there had been briefings either were dismissed as having motives or, in the case where they clearly no longer had motives, were simply ignored. The evidence of Ross Love floats off into the ether as if he had not spoken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no analysis. There was no attempt to say this on the one hand and that on the other hand. There was no attempt to account for discrepancies, as my counsel did in their submission. There is basically a desire to believe that either you are telling the truth or you are lying. As you would know, in many of these examples, what you will have, as I said at the outset, are differing recollections. I have not sought to construe the motives of those people who disagree with me as unpleasant in any way. They need not be. I have said on many occasions that of course I am capable of making mistakes. Where it has been drawn to my attention that I have made mistakes, I have apologised to parliament and corrected records and, in many cases, I have done so in public. That is the second point I would make. The third is that&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To accept that the royal commission had in any way been a legitimate exercise would be simply to add weight to the argument that Marks himself advanced that the use of commissions generally was receding. If we as a community accept this as a legitimate exercise, we accept that commissions can be used for these purposes. When, for instance, Labor is returned to government in Victoria, they will be able to go back and investigate the sorts of contracts that have been entered into by Mr Kennett involving Mr Walker and others. Will it be legitimate for them to go back to all the cabinet ministers at the time in a matter which is frankly suspect and investigate?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my colleagues has just mentioned Wanneroo Inc. At the same time as Mr Court has been obsessed by the question of whether my account of various events was accurate, he has not been prepared to have an open inquiry into matters where there have already been two people gaoled for corruption. So we have enormous double standards operating. There is no royal commission into matters of frank corruption when it comes to Liberal Party involvement, but there is a royal commission into matters of disagreement about events in the Labor Party. By the way, you might note that the commissioner made no reference to what was said or not said in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to set to rest a couple of myths while I have time to do so. The first myth is that royal commissions in some way have authority conferred upon them because they are royal commissions. That is not the case at all. They are a method of inquiry and judgment of them in the end will depend on how well and how properly they are conducted. I am sure members here will know that there are a great many inquiries and commissions whose findings have been thrown into the bottom drawer. I understand that was pretty much the treatment that Mr Fraser gave the meat substitution scandal inquiry when one of his ministers was named adversely. I do not think anything came of that, and they were more serious allegations. In that respect, this commission deserves the same fate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commissions are a tool of executive government and they can be misused. I draw attention to the fact that in this case it is very clear indeed that anything that involved the Premier or his staff was simply ruled out of order by the commissioner. There was no investigation, for instance, of a question that was put by my counsel about whether there had been a briefing of counsel staff, counsel assisting and others by the Premier's office, particularly his staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a very interesting little interchange. What happened was that, in the commission itself, this matter was about to be raised. Mr Court had been asked whether he wanted to continue giving evidence. He said, `Yes, I'm happy. I don't need a cup of tea; I don't need a break.' Then Mr Gyles started to ask him whether or not there had been any briefing by his political staff of the commission, whether they had given any information and who had talked to them, et cetera. Suddenly, Mr Court found it necessary to put up his hand like a school boy and ask to be allowed a break. When he comes back from the break, suddenly the whole matter is discharged and the commissioner refuses to deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That undermines the commission's independence right from the outset. The commissioner was not even prepared to have that question examined. Mr Court was asked in the parliament whether there had been any briefing by his team of people, like Elliott and so on, who had been putting this material together for three years. Don't worry about the Labor Party; this had been going on for three years, since we left government. The Premier was asked in the parliament whether any members of his staff held discussions with the commissioners, counsel assisting the commission or investigators associated with the commission on issues raised before the royal commission and, if so, when those discussions took place. This was the answer which the Premier provided to the parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of officers from the Ministry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>these are the public servants&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of the Premier and Cabinet, including members of the Premier's staff&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he did not name them&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have had discussions with officers of the royal commission. Such discussions ranged from housekeeping matters relating to the administrative arrangements for the royal commission, through to interviews conducted by investigators, responding to requests for information and appearing before the commission under subpoena.</PARA>
<PARA>I draw attention to the last line:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the number of people involved and the frequency of contact with officers of the commission both by telephone and in person, it is not possible to  identify all such discussions.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the way this whole thing has been set up. Today when he was asked the question in a doorstop, the Premier basically left his staff to say that these were administrative discussions. When asked to define what `administrative' was, suddenly they all flew away. From the outset, that is what this has been about. It is not an independent tribunal either in its terms of reference&mdash;it does not reach back to the Liberal Party&mdash;or in the matters that could be decided upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out too, in case members have not noticed, that this royal commission&mdash;this was the reason for our legal protest&mdash;was basically trying to deny the rights of a cabinet to integrity, to go back and dissolve that integrity. It was trying to deny the rights of parliament and in so doing was prepared to trample on a great many conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go through the evidence in detail, but time does not allow me to do that. In so doing, I would give credence to what I think has been a most appalling exercise&mdash;lacking in procedural fairness, refusing to call witnesses that would have given weight to my point of view, having no argument or discussion about the findings, ignoring the evidence of those people whose evidence was close to the view that I had put&mdash;and in all of this, doing so at the bidding of the Court government for the most malicious of political purposes, supported by the Leader of the Opposition, who was not able to remember exactly the nature of the conversations he had had with Mr Court. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House has just witnessed a very important speech by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and a sad and pathetic defence of her position. Not once did she mention in any way, shape or form her response to the evidence given by eight of her former ALP colleagues as part of this royal commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is timely at this stage to remind the House what Royal Commissioner Marks found with regard to the minister, who has just run out of the House. He found firstly that Lawrence was briefed by Zoltan Kovacs and Ed Russell after they had been briefed by a member of the upper house, Halden, about Brian Mahon Easton's allegations and petition. He found also that Lawrence was briefed by Halden himself late in the week before the tabling of the petition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Marks royal commission found that the discussion alleged by Keith Wilson and Pam Beggs to have occurred on 2 November 1992 did in fact take place. The Marks royal commission also found that Lawrence raised the matter later that day with her cabinet office CEO, Marcelle Anderson. In other words, the Marks royal commission found the evidence stacked up&mdash;that the evidence from eight of her colleagues and from her staffers stacked up&mdash;that it was correct and that the minister lied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, as we consider this very important censure motion I think it is time to reflect on the pattern of behaviour of the Minister for Human Services and Health. You do not have to go back so far. Try the interview between Paul Lyneham and Carmen Lawrence on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> on Thursday, 14 September, which the shadow minister for health correctly points out is one of the key turning points in this whole matter. I remind the House that the minister had been asked a week before whether she had been asked to resign and whether she had the support of her colleagues. Of course, it was only then, when Paul Lyneham asked her directly, that it emerged that she had to come clean:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So if I asked you, `Did Gary Gray suggest to you that you should stand aside from your portfolio until this matter is resolved?', you would say what?</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, she then had to give a correct answer&mdash;in that circumstance the complete denial of what she had said just a few days before. That is in the media. That is there for everyone to study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I think is of more relevance is what happened on another matter, the Notre Dame matter, which the minister has decided to bypass completely in these discussions and debates throughout 1995. This matter is one on which she was tested again. This time it was not a royal commission. This time it was a parliamentary committee of the Western Australian parliament. It was back in September 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did that committee find with regard to the statements, conduct and action of the then Premier in relation to Notre Dame? The parliamentary committee found that Carmen Lawrence, the then Premier, `lied and repeatedly misled the Western Australian parliament about the government's offer of a $30 million land package to Notre Dame and related financial guarantees given by the government to the university'. Remember: in 1989 Dr Lawrence was WA minister for education and subsequently was to become Premier. The Western Australian parliamentary committee found in respect of the Notre Dame matter that she had lied and misled the parliament. This conduct, sadly, fits a very grubby pattern of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister had been a Mick Young, she would have stepped aside twice and be gone. If the minister had been a J.J Brown, she would have gone&mdash;complete resignation&mdash;and departed the government. If the minister had even been Ros Kelly, or half a Ros Kelly, with or without whiteboard, she would have departed this House and resigned her commission and the parliament. But of course she hangs on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does she hang on? Because she knows no other. She knows no different pattern of conduct throughout all these years. And so it was back then with regard to the deliberations of the Western Australian parliamentary committee. It was an absolute finding and the absolute finding was that she had lied and she had misled the parliament. At the time there were editorials calling for her to step down and own up in very categorical terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is not enough, let us go to WA Inc., as it became known so famously, and some of the very crucial questions she was asked. I will give an extract:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July to November 1988 did you believe that the purpose and effect of the government involvement in PICL was fully and accurately explained to the public?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cannot recall.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did you attend a Cabinet meeting in about July 1988 at which Mr Parker and another minister discussed Rothwell's current financial position?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No recollection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1988, SGIC and GESB each supported Rothwells to the extent of $50 million. Please state when you first became aware of such support being proposed or having occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No direct knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA>The truth of the matter&mdash;simple facts&mdash;is that Lawrence voted with the government for the motion that the government support Rothwells with a $150 million guarantee. Lawrence voted for the motion put forward to support the government taking an equity investment in the Kwinana petrochemical project. She also voted against the motion to accept the McCusker report, in relation to which an amendment stipulated an urgent need at that time for an inquiry into WA Inc. She opposed opposition calls for a special investigation of Rothwells and she opposed motions for an independent commission of audit to examine government business dealings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is relevant to the Easton matter because the first time Richard Court, then member for Nedlands, raised the matters way back earlier on in the piece, around 16 July 1986, it had nothing to do with the Family Law Act. It had nothing to do with divorce proceedings. It related entirely to some borrowings, some activities related to WA Inc. Again this minister, when asked, and asked repeatedly, then and now&mdash;the famous defence she gave repeatedly in front of the royal commission on a number of occasions&mdash;said, `I have no recollection.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here at the dispatch box, the highest place to where she might answer in terms of the conduct of the Westminster system, in terms of the responsibility of a minister, she failed again today to provide those answers. She failed to even address the list which my colleagues the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) and others have put before the House during the proceedings yesterday and today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to build on what the Leader of the Opposition said&mdash;not with regard to the Reverend Keith Wilson, whose very honest admissions brought about the creation of the royal commission&mdash;and refer to none other than her deputy leader for a period of time, the member for Kalgoorlie, the Labor minister and then Deputy Premier, Ian Taylor. Ian Taylor, I think, is a fairly decent sort of guy. Ian Taylor is one who has gone about his portfolio business and has had to weigh his conscience with regard to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members might recall exactly what happened in relation to the sequence of events and the build-up to the appointment of the royal commission. Every time the Reverend Keith Wilson, Pam Beggs and others had something to say, Ian Taylor went bush. He got himself out of the media. He was torn by his conscience and by what he might respond to the media inquiries. He decided to take leave from the parliament for a period of time. He decided to step back because he had to weigh these matters very seriously. I suppose that was a fair response in the circumstances. He was deputy leader to the then Labor leader, Carmen Lawrence. He had to sit there and work through this matter to reach a conclusion as to what his correct response should be. I admire Ian Taylor in the context that he did weigh very carefully what his response should be. And it was the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, Ian Taylor went before that royal commission and, in spite of that great mateship we get preached about by the Labor Party time and time again, he said, `Forget the mateship. It is time the truth came out. This is exactly what happened.' He gave evidence which led to the conclusion that Carmen Lawrence had lied with regard to these matters, so found by the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, with no motivation whatsoever, when fronting the royal commission, after a careful period of deliberation, he decided to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. He decided to give the evidence in that context, in very clear-cut terms, and remind Carmen Lawrence and the commission of a number of meetings and briefings which took place at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you condemn Ian Taylor? What motive do you ascribe to Ian Taylor? It is about time we heard the real views of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) with regard to these eight who have given evidence. It is about time we heard whether he accepts that they acted in good faith. It may even help if the Deputy Prime Minister explains to the House what he thinks their motive might have been to give that evidence. Because they were not on our side, they were with a conscience and they were determined that the truth came out. Even if that was going to be acutely embarrassing to their former leader, they knew they had an obligation, on oath, to tell the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, I salute not only Ian Taylor but all the others who have given evidence, especially the Reverend Keith Wilson and Pam Beggs who, as the former Minister for Transport, was so outraged that she also categorically denied Carmen Lawrence's version of events with regard to the tabling of that infamous Easton petition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we had Keith Wilson. We had the former deputy leader, Ian Taylor. We had Pam Beggs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these people had any temptation at all to go the other way, they might have been so tempted because their links were with the Labor Party first and foremost. It was an acid test that, when the crunch came, when the point of evidence came before the royal commission, that group of ministers, that group of key staffers, resolved in very categorical terms that Carmen Lawrence's evidence had to be turned over, that Carmen Lawrence's stated events, reported events, summation of events, as was the case with Notre Dame, as was the case with the Easton petition, was not correct and had been fabricated, that she lied and had a totally incorrect recollection of events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> is interesting.

She no longer enjoys the right to hold the office of a federal minister of the Crown.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, you cannot deal with this issue without going to the causes which set it up, the way in which the government devised it, the procedures which it undertook, the deeply unfair, deceitful way in which witnesses were organised before it and, at the end of the day, a set of judgments which at the beginning of the process, or at least midway through the process, the royal commissioner simply said he could not come to with any sense of certainty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Royal commissions are very interesting bodies. They are assumed to have a saintly status, a judicial status. They have none of that, of course. They have a place in our society, but it is a place that has to be regarded with very great caution. I quote an eminent authority on this subject who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find it remarkable that the public accept the conduct of Royal Commissions as a means of obtaining evidence, bearing in mind that our forebears revolted against the Star Chamber, which was a standing Royal Commission of its day. Press and politicians alike seem quite anxious to call for Royal Commissions into all manner of activities, not pausing to consider that the powers of a Royal Commissioner are easily abused. Indeed the public spectacle of witnesses squirming under questioning by the Commissioner or by his assisting counsel provides dramatic copy for the daily press, to the delectation of many of its readers.</PARA>
<PARA>That was Garfield Barwick's view of royal commissions. It is not necessarily the last view that needs to be put on royal commissions; nevertheless, it is one that needs to be taken some notice of. Because of that particular character of royal commissions, the motivation which underpins their establishment and the fairness with which they are conducted are absolutely critical issues in making judgments about their findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be absolutely understood that people do not go before royal commissions with protection. They go before royal commissions in which hearsay evidence is admitted. They go before royal commissions that do not in fact operate on a proper adversarial basis with a capacity to answer charges that are broad. Charges are allowed to remain vague in the course of a royal commission's consideration. The materials that are handled by a royal commission are not necessarily ordered in some fashion that leads to a conclusion. They tend to be entirely anarchic and impressionistic. Those are the problems with royal commissions. So when you are going to assume some sort of sanctity in the findings of a particular royal commission they are not to be dismissed out of hand; nevertheless, they are to be viewed with caution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As much as those findings are to be regarded, therefore, in those sorts of circumstances, so must the motivations that go to the underpinning of it; the selection of the people who appear before it and the order in which they appear. The processes by which people who appear before it are entitled to fairness in their treatment before that royal commission. The terms of reference of a royal commission, above all of course, are to be looked at as to whether or not they do permit a consideration of all the matters that may be relevant to the case, and at the end of the day the motivations of the government that established them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that all royal commissions ought to be regarded with calumny and all the rest of it. But when you have a royal commission with the basis of this royal commission you are absolutely entitled to ask questions about that. This royal commission emanated from a couple of years of hate work that proceeded on a broad front against Carmen Lawrence by the denizens of the Court government&mdash;one of the most deceitful governments that has ever been in existence in Western Australia that attempts to pass judgment on its opponents when it harbours within its ranks a promotion of an individual to a ministerial status who used inside information on the introduction, for example, of the workers compensation act to phone his legal practice prior to it becoming public to ensure a ludicrous situation emerged where, on the day the whole process of workers compensation changed, there were 14 applications for compensation arrangements, 12 from one legal firm&mdash;his!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`What do we do with this sort of individual?' Says Mr Court, `We stick him in the cabinet'. If you have a tricky little fellow like this around the place, why not let him rock on in the broader field?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then of course we have the performance of Richard Court regarding his own peccadillos. Carmen Lawrence named the two members of the Liberal Party for their behaviour in the Wanneroo Inc. affair. This is a man we are supposed to regard as a person who takes royal commissions seriously, who views these things in a dispassionate and fair-minded way and who sets them up because he is seriously disturbed about public conduct and public morality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> have to say about him when it comes to whether or not he is prepared to set up a royal commission into something that really matters, that shrieks out for a royal commission and for some attention from a person of some standing in the community?

The difference in his situation, of course, is that he does not actually have an upper house majority against him forcing him to go through the process of some form of honourable inquiry into those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same office that when they decided to do this piece of log rolling did two things. Firstly, they put in place a very restrictive term of reference. Is it Mr Keating who says that it is a very restrictive term of reference? Is it me who says it is a very restrictive term of reference? Is it Dr Lawrence who says it is a very restrictive term of reference? Is it even the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> which says it is a very restrictive term of reference? No, it is Commissioner Marks who says it is a very restrictive term of reference. It is a man who finds very conclusive opinions on very unbalanced evidence and comes to the conclusion, midway through the inquiry, firstly, that his terms of reference are inadequate to the investigation and, secondly, that any finding he makes will invariably be interpreted by the public as politically tainted. We have been invited to address Commissioner Marks's opinions. We will. We accept his view. Any finding he arrives at is likely to be politically tainted, and we so judge it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as we are concerned, Commissioner Marks's views and findings, because of the way in which the commission was established, because of the way in which his staff were briefed, because of the way in which he called witnesses, because of his inadequacies in dealing with the fact that he needed more open terms of reference to deal with the people who first raised the Easton matter in parliament&mdash;the Family Court matters were first raised in parliament by Richard Court and the Liberals&mdash;because none of that could be capable of being examined in this context, are automatically flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This piece of persecution of Dr Lawrence by Richard Court is not a stand-alone item. We have had another one from the Western Australian government. It had always been frightened that it had only the one punch going, but the one punch might not hang in there, so let us get a second one going. It had running in its office&mdash;not through the police&mdash;an inquiry into the possibility that Carmen Lawrence's administration of the Aboriginal affairs portfolio might have been deficient in the area of an Aboriginal education project that went ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just by accident, this inquiry actually turned up on the computer of somebody else. In most places where government documents go missing and turn up in a way that lends itself to a bit of gathering of evidence, a police inquiry follows&mdash;a police inquiry into the perpetrators, the perpetrators being, at least as far as we know, members of Mr Court's staff but possibly higher than that. We know that there was a police investigation proceeding, but had this matter been ordered and requested by the Western Australian government to look into? Oh, heck no! Why, that would be public accountability. That would be retaining a responsible relationship with the electorate. These would be the sorts of things that an honourable, decent government would do. Perish the thought that we would!<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perish the thought that we, who drag in for a couple of days before a royal commission begins with our political offices&mdash;not dealing with administrative matters&mdash;would sit them down and make sure that they have absolutely in their minds the outcome that we wish to see from this royal commission. No, no! That would be behaviour inconsistent with people who behave like that. So naturally enough we do not do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we are a bit embarrassed by it&mdash;we are capable of embarrassment. So what do we do? We suddenly send all of it off to the DPP's office. We just sneak it out to the gallery and say, `You know, we have an inquiry that we have sent to the DPP's office.' `Oh,' says this opposition in Western Australia, `could we perhaps have the DPP's opinion?' `Oh, heck! What a mistake. We made a bit of a blue here. The DPP did say something about him perhaps not having a look at it, but we cannot give you that information.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extracted like teeth from a hen, finally the fact comes out that the DPP's office said that this is a joke, that this is just your little smearing effort, your little slander effort. It would have been nice if he had also said that it was of a piece with your royal commission. Of course, he did not say that; he is a proper man. He just stuck with what was before him. He said, `You can forget that for starters.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we have here is a set of processes put in place for entirely political reasons and then a set of conclusions. They are not a balanced set of conclusions&mdash;which is what I think you would be entitled to have on the basis of evidence before you&mdash;but an absolute rot-ridden set of judgments. Having cast out on the terms of reference and having cast out on the political processes associated with it, Commissioner Marks then felt it incumbent upon himself to come to some very firm conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was his conclusion? It is interesting that you keep citing the cabinet ministers. Not one cabinet minister went into that place and said that a petition had been presented to them. Not one cabinet minister went into that place and said that there was discussion of the matters that were the subject of the petition&mdash;not one of them. They did argue and were at variance with the memories of Dr Lawrence. The issues of the Easton petition were blasted about the parliament and the press and to everybody else who felt like taking an interest in it for the previous four years. They alleged that those issues were raised there. But a petition? No. None of them came to the conclusion that a petition had been discussed in the cabinet proceedings, spilled out by Commissioner Marks against all precedent in terms of cabinet inquiries&mdash;not one. The judgment was made on the petition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only person whose evidence was ignored was the bloke who wrote the petition. The only bloke whose evidence was ignored was the bloke who advised that they should do it. The only bloke whose evidence was ignored was the bloke who the day before it was produced for the first time placed it into the hands of a member of parliament, Mr Halden. That is entirely consistent with the argument that Dr Lawrence has put forward, that she could not have received it before that date. Then a judgment was made by a man obviously ignorant of parliamentary procedure that somehow there was a choice for Dr Lawrence as to whether or not it ought to be presented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid that the judgment was too severe on the evidence presented. The judgment was erroneous on the question of the circumstances surrounding the tabling of the petition. The underpinnings of this royal commission were an absolute disgrace&mdash;an absolute disgrace from a disgraceful government. Because it was a disgraceful government putting up a disgraceful set of propositions, you got a disgraceful outcome. It ought not to take the time of this parliament for one second more.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I intend to sum up in a few minutes. I thank the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) for his contribution to the debate. I have noticed that, every time he speaks in this House on veterans' issues, he is very sincere in what he says&mdash;he is a veteran himself&mdash;and I have said that on a number of occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, he continually does say that, over the years, there has been a diminution of veterans' entitlements. I just simply want to put on the record that that is not the case. It may be the way he looks at it. But, in recent years alone, there has been enormous improvements in the lot of our veterans, perhaps not in so far as making big increases in pension payments but certainly in terms of aged care services, extension of benefits and such initiatives as veterans' health week and allowing them to see osteopaths and chiropractors&mdash;there are just too many improvements to mention. I want to reject out of hand what the honourable member for McPherson continually says in this place; namely, that there has been a diminution. In fact, it has been the other way around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also noted with interest the comments by the member on the subject of domiciliary nursing care in New South Wales. I know that just about all members of this House and also of the New South Wales state house have been written to by the Domiciliary Nurses Association. Naturally, they are very concerned. Up until now, some 93 per cent of all domiciliary nursing in New South Wales has been carried out by the private sector, whereas in places like Western Australia it has all been done by the public sector. The public sector is just as good&mdash;and, I understand, in some cases better&mdash;than the private sector in delivering these services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for McPherson said, I did follow up the concerns expressed in this place recently and have been able to give him my assurances that veterans and war widows will continue to receive domiciliary nursing care which meets their clinical needs. The member asked how many showers per week a veteran receiving community nursing would get. I think he was implying that they will not be getting as many and therefore will not be receiving the same care as when they were nursed by private nursing services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have looked into this matter for him and I can assure him unequivocally that a veteran who is being nursed by community nurses and who requires assistance with showering will be showered as often as is necessary. This can be every day but I understand that, on average, it is around three times per week. I would also like to assure the member for McPherson that, if after assessment by the local community health centre a veteran or war widow is assessed as not clinically needing a registered nurse to provide services such as showering, a follow-up assessment is made to ensure that home care is provided as required, which can include assistance with showering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In summary, I would just like to confirm that there really is no need for the honourable member to be concerned on this matter. I receive very few complaints, if any, with respect to community nursing around Australia. I have no reason to doubt that that will be the case, as new veterans come on line and receive care from community nurses in New South Wales. It is my responsibility as the minister for the government in this area to ensure that I get the best value per dollar in the area of veterans' services in so far as it relates to domiciliary nursing and I will continue to do that. </PARA>

<PARA>The Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, which is now before the House, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Most of the amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals in this House. I will briefly outline the changes of substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 1 is operative from 17 March 1995 and contains an amendment to item 31 in part II of schedule 4 of the principal act. The concessional item allows the duty free importation of aircraft parts, materials and test equipment for use in the manufacture, repair or maintenance of aircraft with the exception of goods used for the servicing of aircraft. Following the government's acceptance in 1991 of recommendations contained in Industry Commission report No. 9 on the commercial tariff concession and by-law systems, the terms of item 31 in schedule 4 were revised. By a broad application of the current conditions, it has been possible to import, duty free, most goods used in aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has now decided to restrict the coverage of this item by excluding textiles and goods made of textiles for use on aircraft. This initiative will remove the competitive advantage previously accorded imported goods over locally sourced goods by the use of item 31. It will also encourage the use of Australian raw textile materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 2 of the bill is operative from 1 April 1995. Customs tariff rates of duty have been subjected to a phasing regime since July 1988. Blood packs and blood pack systems used for collecting, processing, storing and administering blood and blood components have traditionally been classified by the Australian Customs Service as infusion and transfusion sets for blood and other fluids. They were subject to 10 per cent duty prior to 1 July 1995, phasing to five per cent in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This classification was successfully challenged in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal with the result that the AAT set aside the customs classification, considering the goods to be properly classified to a duty free item. The immediate removal of the 10 per cent assistance would have had a detrimental effect on local industry and is not consistent with the intent of the government's tariff phase down program. This government is aware of the consequences to industry of sudden and large reductions in the level of protection. This amendment reinstates the intended level of assistance for the subject goods by specifically designating blood packs and blood pack systems used for collecting, processing, storing and administering blood and blood components in the tariff classification that Customs originally considered appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3, which is operative from 10 May 1995, implements the 1995-1996 federal budget announcement of an increase of 10 per cent in the customs rate of duty for manufactured tobacco and tobacco products. The previously legislated increase of five per cent for these goods planned for August 1995 will now not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 4 is operative from 1 July 1995 and contains a number of amendments. The first inserts an additional note in chapter 27 to define `fuel oil'. In recent years, oil refineries have been producing fuel oils of lower density which are capable of being used in diesel engines. The effect of this note will be to exclude light fuel oils from the new definition of fuel oil, and in future those light fuel oils will attract the diesel fuel rate of duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the rates of customs duty on aviation gasoline are increased by 0.883 cents per litre on aviation kerosene and by 1.847 cents per litre on aviation gasoline. These increases were announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in the 1995-1996 federal budget. The additional revenue will provide funding for aviation safety regulation and be part of the industry's contribution to the recovery of airway services costs attributable to aviation gasoline powered aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another change inserts in chapter 73 an additional note to confirm the tariff classification of razor wire. The new additional note implements a decision of the World Customs Organisation that this wire be classified in tariff heading 7313. Other changes are of an administrative nature and have no duty implications. Summaries of the amendments contained in this bill have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 April 1994, beer produced from micro-breweries and U-brews was made excisable under the Tariff Act.

While raising additional revenue, this measure also supports government health policy that is aimed at discouraging smoking. As a consequence of this 10 per cent increase, it is also proposed to remove manufactured tobacco and tobacco products from the 5 per cent discretionary increase in excise duty which was due to take effect on 1 August 1995.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On budget night, the Treasurer also announced measures that were intended to close the revenue loophole allowing light fuel oil to be used as a substitute for diesel, especially in the transport area. Light fuel oil is excisable at the concessional rate of duty applying to fuel oil and diesel is excisable at a considerably higher rate of duty. It is proposed to amend the physical characteristics of fuel oil, as set out in subsection 3(4) of the Tariff Act, in order to exclude light fuel oil with effect from 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this proposed amendment is that light fuel oil will no longer comply with the physical characteristics of fuel oil. As a result, light fuel oil will become excisable at the higher rate of duty applying the diesel fuel, thus removing the commercial incentive to continue to use light fuel oil as a transport fuel substitute for diesel. Clause 5 and item 1 of schedule 3 propose to amend the Tariff Act to implement this amendment.

It is proposed to increase the rate of excise duty on avgas by 1.847 cents per litre. Of this increase, 0.883 cents will contribute to funding air safety regulation, undertaken by the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority, that benefits the travelling public and, in part, aviation industry participants. The remaining increase of 0.964 cents per litre on avgas will recover part of the airways costs that are attributable to avgas powered aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also proposed to increase the excise duty on avtur by 0.883 cents per litre. As with avgas, this increase will contribute to funding air safety regulation that benefits the travelling public and, in part, aviation industry participants.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also proposes to remove an unintended consequence of the Tariff Act with respect to condensate that is separately produced from stabilised oil. With the first crude oil development soon to commence production from the North West Shelf project area&mdash;which is now the only offshore area subject to the excise regime&mdash;small quantities of stabilised oil will be mixed with the condensate stream. It is not technically possible to remove all the stabilised oil from the natural gas/condensate stream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under subsection 5B(3) of the Tariff Act, where this mixture of condensate and stabilised oil is entered for home consumption, all the condensate will be deemed to be stabilised oil and excisable at the rate of excise under sub-item 17A. This is clearly not the intention of the policy first introduced in 1977 which was designed to encourage condensate production by giving condensate concessional excise treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, therefore, proposed to create an exception to the operation of subsection 5B(3) in respect of condensate that is separately produced from stabilised oil. As a corollary to this, it is also proposed to make condensate that is separately produced, or separately marketed, from stabilised oil excise exempt. However, condensate that is for use as a fuel will continue to be excisable under other provisions of the Tariff Act as will condensate that is produced with, and entered as a mixture with, stabilised oil.

Topped crude which has the same characteristics as fuel oil as defined under subsection 3(4) of the Tariff Act will also continue to be excisable at the concessional rate applying to fuel oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is intended to remove a potential diesel fuel substitution problem with topped crude that exists due to the excise rate differentials between topped crude and diesel. This substitution problem is similar to the light fuel oil substitution, which has also been addressed by this bill, as it is possible for some topped crudes to be used as transport fuel substitutes for diesel fuel. Therefore, by increasing the excise duty payable on topped crude not having the characteristics of fuel oil to the same rate as diesel fuel, the commercial incentive to use topped crude as a substitute for diesel, particularly in the transport area, is removed. </PARA>

The opposition supports this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 2 of the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill applies to blood packs and blood pack systems. These items were previously classified by the Australian Customs Service so they were subject to duty of 10 per cent, but a decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has reclassified the items with the effect of removing the tariff assistance. This amendment restores the rate of duty to its previous level so as to avoid the problems of a sudden loss of tariff protection for this industry. The opposition supports this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3 of the bill gives effect to the government's budget decision to increase the excise and customs duty on manufactured tobacco and tobacco products by 10 per cent. This is generally consistent with the coalition's policy to discourage smoking and is supported by the coalition parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to schedule 4, the first measure increases the excise on light fuel oil and forms part of the 1995 budget. Prior to 1 July 1995, the excise payable on all fuel oils was 6.7c per litre and the diesel excise was 32.5c per litre. This difference in excise of some 26c per litre encouraged some users of diesel fuel to switch to light fuel oils to avoid the higher excise. Given sufficient time, there was the possibility of a large number of diesel users changing to light fuel oil at a potential cost to government revenue of some $140 million for the 1995-96 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the excise on light fuel oil was increased to the same level as diesel fuel on 1 July 1995 following the tabling of excise and customs tariff proposals on 29 June this year in the parliament. At the same time, eligibility for the diesel fuel rebate scheme was extended to consumers of light fuel oil. In fact, I suspect that few of those subjected to the increase in excise on light fuel oil would be able to then claim the diesel fuel rebate, as they would generally have switched from diesel to light fuel oil because they were ineligible for the diesel rebate in the first place. It is worth noting that on 1 August 1995 automatic indexation of petroleum excises further increased the excise on diesel and light fuel oil to 33.5c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government amendments to the original bill also increase the excise on topped crude oils used other than as refinery feedstock from 6.9c per litre to the same excise level as diesel and light fuel oil of 33.5c per litre. These topped crudes have been used as substitutes for diesel and fuel oil, raising the possibility of consumers avoiding excise by switching from diesel or light fuel oil to topped crudes. Again the government identifies a potential financial saving of up to $140 million per year based on the potential for large-scale switching from diesel and light fuel oil to topped crude oil to avoid excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this estimate is based on the simplistic assumption that all users of diesel and light fuel oil could switch to the use of topped crude oil. That is a very shaky assumption to make but, in any event, the financial cost to government revenue would have proved substantial. In consequence, the National and Liberal parties are not prepared to have excise revenue eroded by this loophole, particularly given the difficult state of the Commonwealth's budgetary position at this stage, with its much vaunted budget surplus disappearing a few months after its proclamation, and therefore we will not oppose the increase of excise on light fuel oil and topped crude oils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before moving on, I would like to seek an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), who is at the table, that where there are unintended consequences of this increase in excise on topped crude oil, the government will act to remove these consequences. It is my understanding that at least one case has been drawn to the attention of the government, and I would be happy to provide further details if required. I give an assurance to the House that I will be pursuing the matter that has been brought to my attention with the government at a later date depending on the outcome of discussions the particular company has with the Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also covered in schedule 4 are increases in aviation fuel duties. As of 1 July this year, the duty on aviation gasoline, or avgas, was increased by 1.847c per litre and the duty on aviation turbine fuel, or avtur, increased by 0.883c per litre. These duties and excises were further increased by three per cent on 1 August as a result of the automatic CPI indexation of petroleum product excises. Currently the duty on avgas is 19.65c per litre with a component paid to Airservices Australia for air traffic services of 17.2c per litre. The remaining component of 2.45c per litre is paid to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to fund air safety regulation. The increase in the airways services component of the avgas duty follows a recommendation earlier this year by the then Civil Aviation Authority for a 3.4c per litre increase, which was rejected by the industry and the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now indicate that the proposal to increase the airways services component of the avgas duty by 0.964c per litre, raising $1.1 million per year in revenue, will be opposed by the coalition parties in the Senate. It is inequitable to use fuel duties to recover the cost of providing airways services to general aviation. Specifically, many general aviation operators and private pilots only use the system rarely but still have to pay thousands of dollars a year in duty. This is particularly true for agricultural operators, who may never use these services at all, but pay a staggering $7,800 per year on average for the privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 4 also contains an amendment to clarify the customs tariff classification of various types of wire. As Australia is a signatory to the harmonised system, a recent ruling by the World Customs Organisation on these types of wire is binding and is being implemented through this amendment. Also dealt with in schedule 4 are routine amendments to clarify the tariff classification of parts of tractors for dumpers of Canadian origin, and blood packs and blood pack systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final schedule, No. 5, in the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill removes an error in cross-referencing between the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Naturally, the opposition supports this amendment. The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 makes corresponding amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 for the measures I have already discussed concerning tobacco, fuel oil, topped crude oil, avgas and avtur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, a further item excludes from indexation the excise duty on beer produced from home brewing kits. When beer produced from these kits was made excisable from 1 April 1994, it was not intended that the rate of duty be subject to indexation. This amendment removes this anomaly and appropriately is retrospective to 1 April 1994. It is good news for home brewers; and we support the amendment. A further routine amendment will exempt condensate from the application of the Tariff Act where it is separately produced, or separately marketed from stabilised crude petroleum oil. This routine measure has the support of the petroleum industry and the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, when the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill reaches the Senate, the coalition will seek to amend the bill to formally remove the increase in the airways services component, 0.964c per litre, of the avgas duty. Additionally, I seek assurances from the parliamentary secretary that any unintended consequences of increasing the excise on topped crude oil will be considered favourably. </PARA>

There are two aircraft fuels, as the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) pointed out, to be targeted by this proposed increase&mdash;aviation gasoline, known as avgas, and aviation turbine fuel. For the benefit of the House and those who are unfamiliar with the terms, let me say that avgas is used in piston engine propeller aircraft and turbine fuel is used in jet aircraft and turbine engine propeller aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 July this year, the government increased the duty on avgas by 1.847c per litre and increased the duty on aviation turbine fuel by 0.883c per litre. It is the increase in avgas prices that the coalition takes most exception to. This is because a large percentage of this increase in avgas duties will be paid for by aircraft operators who will not enjoy the benefits of it. This makes the increase grossly unfair and highly inequitable. It will hit small aircraft operators in our rural and remote communities with yet another series of costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As so often occurs to people in the bush, they will not enjoy the full benefits of the money they pay. As of August this year, over 19.5c from every litre of avgas goes on excise duties. Of this amount, approximately 2.5c or 13 per cent goes to help fund air safety regulation, while 17c or 87 per cent goes to Air Services Australia to pay for air traffic services used by avgas powered and other aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase which came into effect on 1 July this year was 1.847c per litre. This is broken up into two categories. The 0.883c per litre will contribute to the safety regulations component. The second component is the 0.964c per litre which will go to airways services. The coalition does not oppose the increase in the safety regulation component. It is the opinion of the coalition that the safety of Australian airline services needs to be improved and the increase in excise duty will contribute to this end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the increase in the second component of the excise duty&mdash;that which goes to airways services&mdash;that I and the federal opposition most strongly object to. The major reason we do so is that it is fundamentally inequitable. An excise duty on fuel is being used to provide airways services for general aviation use, regardless of how often an aircraft operator uses the airways services. This is unfair because of the fact that only on rare occasions do many of the general aviation operators&mdash;particularly those in rural Australia&mdash;use the airways services, but they still have to pay thousands of dollars every year in excise duty for a service they never use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, agricultural operators are now paying the equivalent of $7,800 per plane per year for services they do not use. Farmers who use planes for farming and agricultural related purposes, but who would hardly ever use airways services, are having to pay the same amount as city operators who fly the exact same aircraft but who use airways services all the time. Is it any wonder that the people of rural and regional Australia have given up on this government?</PARA>

It is not only the people on the farms out there in rural Australia, but also the people in small business in rural Australia who are tired of this government's biased approach to the people who choose to make their life, bring up their families, and run their businesses out there in rural Australia. Making the situation worse, this increase in excise duty comes at a time when rural Australia is just starting to emerge from the worst drought in living memory. Many farmers have not had a decent income in five years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) will at least try to understand that many of these communities that are so dependent on the agricultural sector are feeling the effects of the lack of income and the impact of the drought on our country towns and provincial cities. I imagine that even towns like the one that the parliamentary secretary makes his home in&mdash;Townsville&mdash;would be feeling the effect of the prolonged drought in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this prolonged drought, farm debt has escalated. In 1983, when the federal Labor Party took control of government, rural debt was $7 billion. Today it is $17 billion and growing daily. Average farm debt is in excess of $145,000. Our rural producers are desperate to get a decent income again. Many of them will not survive the effects of debt and drought. This increase in excise duty is going to impact on our rural communities, on the small business sector, on our provincial cities and on the nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lately we have heard the Treasurer (Mr Willis) blaming the poor current account results on the drought. Because the current account deficit is not coming down as rapidly as the government would like, the government is blaming the drought. That is clear evidence that the drought is an issue not only for regional and rural Australia but nationally. It is affecting our national economy. Yet this increase in excise duty is going to add to the cost of production and make it harder for farmers to earn a level of income which would ease their financial situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private aeroplanes are an increasingly important tool in production in the farming sector. They are being used widely for fertilising, mustering and water management. They are an important method of controlling and spotting bushfires. They are also an effective way of controlling pests such as locusts and mice. Only recently, planes in my electorate that would never use these airways services were baiting a mice plague that was devastating the limited crops being grown in that area. These planes are not used for pleasure or carrying passengers; they are used for carrying herbicides, pesticides and, in this case, baits to combat the mice plague. Yet these aeroplanes have to pay this increase in fuel tax even though they will not use the airways services. </PARA>

But they are not reducing the debt on those assets when they sell them. They are using those funds to pay the bills. But what are they doing now? They want to hit the productive sector that will drag this economy out of the depths of debt that it is in. This government keeps lumping these taxes on the productive sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on light fuel oil, as the member for Gippsland did, because it is an important point. After 1 July this year, the excise rate on light fuel oil was increased to 32.5c a litre in order to bring it up to the same rate as diesel fuel. This was done because some business sectors use light fuel oil as a substitute for diesel fuel in order to get around the excise cost on diesel. This increase will have a serious impact on two industry sectors in particular: one is the marine tourism operator and the other is the rail freight sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in excise will have an impact on the marine tourism industry by making tourist services more expensive and reducing their capacity to be competitive. The reason the marine tourist operators first moved to light fuel oil was that they were excluded from the diesel fuel rebate scheme. This exclusion in itself is difficult to justify because tourism is a viable and expanding international industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of the admission to the rebate scheme, the use of light fuel oils allowed them to compete in the expanding world of international tourism. The increase in excise charges will remove that capacity to be competitive. It is only going to add another cost to tourism operators. At the end of the day, they will have to put up their charges. Who will pay? The consumer will have to pay. They will say that it is getting too expensive to see our Great Barrier Reef in North Queensland. People who come to Australia will tell their friends that things are more expensive if you go to Australia than if you go to another country. That is the bottom line with this. This is just another way of hitting a growing and valuable industry in this country which is contributing to the nation's wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on rail services, because rail is an important component of our transport industries in this country. Rail freight costs are bound to increase as a direct result of the increase in the cost of fuel. This tax increase will fall almost entirely on the rural export industries, further reducing their productive capacity and competitiveness. Once again, we see the effects of a high taxing government on the productive sector of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rail freight in this country has been a very important element in ensuring that large volumes of produce can be moved safely and quickly over long distances at competitive rates. The increase in the excise will impact on the cost of freight in this country. It will be just another tax on the productive sector. It is another tax grab from Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another element I would like to touch on is rural electricity generation. The increase in the excise duty on light fuel will have negative consequences for many rural communities that generate their own electricity. Many electricity generators in rural regions across Australia run on light fuel oil. Unlike the exemption available to coal-fired electricity stations, no exemption on light fuel oil will be available to those electricity generators. Subsequently, any increase in production costs will only be passed on to rural people and rural businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just another example of how the increases contained in this legislation will hit rural and regional communities. People in rural Australia wonder what they have done to deserve this. They have done nothing to deserve this. They are part of a productive sector of our economy. They choose to make their lives in rural and regional Australia. They are bringing up families in rural and regional Australia. What we see in this bill is a tax grab involving rural communities, which are our productive sectors. It will only add to their costs. There will be no benefits as a result of this. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to speak briefly on the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2). I will raise a couple of points that have been referred to by the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). Let us be perfectly honest, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) is another attempt to fix the holes in the government's budget strategy relating to diesel fuel excise. The latest changes seek to change the definition of fuel oils so that light fuel oils attract the same rate of excise as diesel fuel oil and to increase the rate of excise duty on certain topped crude oil.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at some of the matters that speakers such as the member for Maranoa and others have raised in this debate. With the changes that are being proposed to light fuel oil and the definition of fuel oils in the Excise Tariff Act, we are going to see yet another destabilisation, yet another alteration, to the excise regime for small businesses. This evening I want to examine how businesses are affected by such a change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also included in this particular bill is an amendment proposed by schedule 2 which increases the rate of excise on manufactured tobacco and tobacco products by approximately 10 per cent. That increase gives effect to the government's 1995-96 budget announcement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rate of excise (and corresponding customs duty) on manufactured tobacco and tobacco products will be increased by $7.18 per kilogram (10 per cent) from midnight on 9 May 1995. This increase brings forward and replaces the previously announced 5 per cent discretionary increase in tobacco excise scheduled for August 1995. As well as raising additional revenue, this measure supports health policy aimed at discouraging smoking.</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed increase in excise on manufactured tobacco and tobacco products is estimated to result in an increase in revenue of $70 million in 1995-96 and $66 million in 1996-97. That is a matter that those of us who are concerned about the effects of smoking as a community health issue would have to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the most contentious aspect of the bill concerns the taxation of light fuel oils. We have been told that the amendment proposed by item 1 of schedule 3 of the bill changes the definition of fuel oil in the Excise Tariff Act 1921. As noted in the explanatory memorandum, the new definition is intended to exclude light fuel oils. The exclusion of light fuel oils from the definition will result in light fuel oils attracting the higher diesel fuel rate of excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have heard already this matter is of concern to operators of equipment that is easily convertible for operation on light fuel oils, and the member for Maranoa has mentioned one of the areas particularly affected: tourism operators in areas such as the Great Barrier Reef. I understand from the material that has been circulated that this proposed exclusion of light fuel oils from the definition of fuel oil is estimated to result in an increase in revenue of $100 million in 1995-96 and $100 million in 1996-97. Again, this measure was announced in the 1995-96 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prospect of the disallowance of the measure contained in item 1 of schedule 3 relating to light fuel oil, which applies from 1 July 1995, raises questions regarding the position of a refund of the excise paid since the measure had force under excise tariff proposal No. 3 of 1995. An excerpt from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is arguable, if a disallowance by Parliament results in the measure being void, and therefore not operative at all, or voidable, which means that it will not operate from the time of disallowance, will depend on whether this issue is dealt with in the measure to disallow the proposed increase in duty.</PARA>
<PARA>That leads me to the main point of my speech this evening: the awful confusion that is reigning on the definition of fuel. The matters also relate to the changes being proposed or mooted in the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill, which is also designed to fix the problems that have been created by this confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For one of my constituents, a constituent who operates a granite quarry near York in Western Australia's wheat belt, this is a very serious problem. His particular quarry has been a small affair which has been run until now by his son. The business was purchased in 1974, and because of access to the diesel fuel rebate it provided a very meagre profit for the owners, the Wales family. For small businesses, profit is the be-all and end-all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the situation here where, because of increasing competition from overseas products, businesses are finding it more and more difficult to make a profit and keep their staff employed. That quarry business has found itself in a position where very shortly it may well have to cease operation unless it is able to compete more favourably against overseas competition. Sales of granite, for instance, have halved over the past five years with imports of granite from overseas&mdash;such as Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong&mdash;decimating the local market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular small business has been getting smaller through no fault of the owners or operators. Three years ago the operation employed three men full time as well as Mr Wales's son. But, as we have been told by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), this is the best it will get for small businesses. Now, as a result of the confusion that is being created by these changes, we find ourselves in a situation where this particular small business will lose its rebate for diesel fuel, which will put it in a very precarious position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation may be compared with the situation which arose with the imposition of sales tax on in situ pools, which was introduced by amendments to the sales tax legislation in 1992. The sales tax was ruled by the High Court to be invalid as a breach of section 55 of the constitution, as the act that imposed the tax dealt with more than the imposition of taxation. Consequently, the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Act 1992 was passed with the aim of ensuring that the sales tax that had been paid on such pools was refunded only to those who could show that they had actually paid the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Maranoa also indicated that items 2 and 3 of schedule 3 increase the rate of excise payable on aviation gasoline and kerosene. The rate of excise duty payable on aviation gasoline will increase by 1.847c per litre to 19.08c per litre and for aviation kerosene by 0.883c per litre to 2.38c per litre. The government's rationale for these increases is to contribute to assisting funding for air safety regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet again, that is another impost on small business, and it is one that many will find themselves in a position of not being able to afford. We have only to look at the now increasingly cumbersome range of taxes impacting on small businesses to understand why when the Prime Minister repeats his now notorious phrase, `This is as good as it's going to get,' many small business operators in the nation start to pull out their remaining hair and look at some other means of making a living. The fact of the matter is that we have an increasing tax burden on small businesses as a result not only of the direct imposition of increases in tax rates but also of the increasing complexity and difficulty in being able to deal with the taxation regime from which the increased rate will be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where the whole of this fuel excise is like an uncontrolled monster devouring all in its path. The question that many small business people are asking themselves is, `Where next? What will we be faced with next? How will we be able to be taxed, or are our pips going to squeak before any more can be extracted from us?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the quarry operation that I referred to earlier. Here we have a situation where a small family business is now basically being crushed by the totality of the taxation regime under this government, ranging from the treatment of fuel excise all the way through to the other add-on costs that make it almost impossible for it to be able to compete with overseas businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, in recent times we have seen the types of problems that Australian industries are facing in the context of increased participation in competition with overseas operators who are exporting to Australia. Because of the Australian business tax regime, more and more of our local operators&mdash;particularly in niche markets such as the constituents are in in my electorate&mdash;are finding it increasingly difficult to compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what will happen in the case of the closure of that particular quarry business? Yet another Australian will be thrown on to the scrap heap, and we will find ourselves yet again with one less business and one less employer. If we are to solve the unemployment crisis in our nation, we must recognise that small business is the key. As we well know, small business is the largest employer in the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These particular tariff bills, as has been raised by previous speakers, serve to increase the complexity of the taxation arrangements. I have mentioned the extract from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> which in itself is supposed to be a simplification of the way in which the bills will work. It is extremely complicated and difficult to understand. These sorts of costs, these extra imposts on small businesses throughout the country, add to the unprofitability or lack of competitiveness, and mean in the end that people will choose to cease operating and will find something else to do or some other way to use their valuable capital, rather than put their fellow Australians into work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier I indicated I would make some brief comments on my concern that, in relation to the definition of fuel oils as a result of that budget strategy, we find ourselves in another situation where more and more complex taxation legislation is heaped upon small business operators who are increasingly less able to deal with this taxation regime. As we know, in the case of the income tax regime, there are several thousand pages of taxes. In the case of sales tax, it is more and more complicated and difficult to understand. Increasingly, the application of sales tax is corrupted by political decisions, and I intend to deal with other aspects of that in some of the bills that will be before us in this session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the final analysis, a business tax regime that does nothing to ensure that the small business sector will be able to play its part in employing more Australians cannot play its part in being, I suppose, the prime mover in getting unemployed Australians back into the work force. It is unfortunate it has come to this, it is unfortunate that we find ourselves in this position, but again we find that complexity is the name of the game. At the end of the day the bureaucracy and the complexity of the taxation legislation come down to crush small businesses which are at this particular point finding it difficult to operate and to compete, even without extra taxation imposts. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments are operative on and from 11 October 1995. They are similar to provisions contained in the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995, which is being debated cognately with the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill. Schedule 4 of this bill contains an amendment to chapter 27 to define the physical characteristics of fuel oil. The result of that change means the fuel excluded from the definition will attract the higher diesel fuel rate of duty. The amendment is designed to eliminate the widespread use of light fuel oil as a substitute for diesel fuel by high volume diesel fuel consumers. That change is operative from 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the government's action, the production of light fuel oil since July has dropped dramatically. It has now come to the notice of the Australian Customs Service that production of topped crude petroleum oil has increased significantly since 1 July this year. Further, topped crude petroleum oil is being used as a substitute for diesel fuel. Again, there exists the potential for a multimillion dollar loss in government revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes contained in these amendments have the same effect as those taken earlier in the year. In other words, the physical characteristics of fuel oil produced from topped crude petroleum oils are defined in additional note 1 to chapter 27 and a tariff split has been created for this category of fuel oil. Goods not meeting those specifications have a separate subheading and will attract the higher diesel fuel rate of duty. A summary of the amendments contained in this bill has been prepared and has been circulated for the information of honourable members. I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum and I commend the amendments to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>As with the amendment moved to the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, the amendment before the House now rejects inequitable use of fuel duty to fund the cost of providing airway services to general aviation. We have had an extraordinary concession from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay)&mdash;it has taken me quite by surprise&mdash;that the government is looking afresh at this issue of imposing fuel duty to provide airway services to general aviation.

<PARA>The bill is aimed at increasing the flexibility of the operations of the Industry Commission, which is the government's major advisory body on industry matters, broadly defined. The government values the major contribution of the Industry Commission as a catalyst for micro-economic reform in Australia. Its strengths are its independence, established expertise, public inquiry process, and economy-wide approach to examining issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments contained in the bill are of a purely procedural nature and involve three basic changes: allowing commissioners to be appointed on a part-time basis, including permanent part-time employment, in addition to the current full-time basis; a consequential increase in the number of commissioners, other than the chairperson, from eight to 11; and allowing the progression of the commission's public hearings in emergency situations, where one or more commissioners may be unable to attend due to circumstances beyond their control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first basic change follows from the current provision in the Industry Commission Act 1989 which allows commissioners to be appointed only on a full-time basis. The government has found that this provision limits its ability to attract a more diverse range of suitably qualified people. This change will allow the government to recruit those who hold other positions and are unwilling to become full-time commissioners. Consequently, the bill has been drafted to allow the appointment of commissioners on either a full-time or part-time basis, with equal powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second basic change, of increasing the maximum number of commissioners, necessarily follows the first. The commission will need to maintain the same level of resources at the commissioner level, thus requiring more commissioners in total if there are to be part-time appointees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third basic change is intended to provide additional flexibility to the commission in the conduct of its public hearings. Where one or more commissioners on an inquiry are unable to attend a scheduled public hearing due to unforeseen circumstances such as accident, illness or injury, the remaining commissioner will be able to preside at the public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining amendments are drafting changes consequential on the above proposed amendments. The proposed amendments do not have any financial implications. However, should the number and mix of full-time and part-time commissioners increase beyond the present funding levels, an increase in funding will be sought through the normal budgetary processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will allow the commission greater flexibility in its operations and increase its chances of attracting a more diverse range of suitably qualified people to the commission. I commend the bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because the Industry Commission Amendment Bill 1995 is largely a machinery provision which provides for greater flexibility in the operation of the Industry Commission, as the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has indicated in his second reading speech, it is eminently sensible and accordingly will not be opposed by the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to recap briefly, the amendment to allow the appointment of commissioners other than the chairperson on a part-time basis, in addition to the current full-time basis, is one which is aimed at increasing the commission's chances of attracting a more diverse range of suitably qualified people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major amendment&mdash;allowing a single commissioner to act on behalf of all other commissioners on an inquiry in the absence of other commissioners but limited to public hearings and only in emergency situations&mdash;will also allow for the commission to operate in that, due to unforeseen circumstances such as accident, illness or injury, preventing one or other commissioners on the inquiry from participating in a public hearing, the remaining commissioner will be able to reside at the public hearing or part of the public hearing. It also adds some flexibility to the operation of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final amendment of substance that requires full-time commissioners to obtain the consent of the minister to engage in paid employment outside the duties of his office and restrict part-time commissioners from engaging in paid employment that in the minister's opinion conflicts with the proper performance of the commissioner's duties also adds flexibility to the operation of the Industry Commission.

One of the stories in it, which is very relevant to this year of Australia Remembers, shows that a lot of people went away to war and, when it finished, they were overseas and they were never really welcomed home. A member of the committee that I chaired initially and then handed over to chairman Len Streets said to me that he never got a welcome home.

It is not something that was written by a historian that put only their views. This was written by the people involved. One of them, Alan Hopkins, wrote to me. He was a pilot who dropped food over the Netherlands in Operation Manna. He wrote to me to see whether he could get some funding to go back to the Netherlands or get a plane from the Australian government to take part in the celebrations in Holland. So I wrote to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), but that could not be arranged. He also wrote to the Dutch Embassy here in Australia and he received a letter back from the Counsellor of the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Canberra. This letter brings home to you a lot of what Australian people did overseas:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the period of April-May, 1945, I found myself as a five-year-old boy on the receiving end of Operation Manna, living at that time with my parents in the suburb of The Hague, close to the Ypenburg airfield where the food droppings took place.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that there would be very few electorates, organisations and committees that put more into this 12 months than my committee in Ballarat. A lot of things have happened in the last six years in my time as the member for Ballarat, but none has given me more pride than this group of people. It comprised Liberal Party politicians, former state members and people from right across the board. The committee represented people from all political persuasions and from right across the community. It worked extremely well. It is a classic example of the fact that this Australia Remembers year has included people from all sides and from all communities who were anxious to ensure that Australia Remembers was a bipartisan event and a great success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to go through some of the very many events that were held in my electorate over this period. It is a large electorate. There are many communities and they all had a very active input. In no particular order, there was the Daylesford street parade and memorial service and the unveiling of a plaque at Marnoo. The Ballan Hospital presented a patient trolley with a plaque as part of the celebrations. There was a Ballarat VP Day wreath-laying memorial service at the Cenotaph and the presentation of a memorial sculpture to the city council. The sculpture was designed by Mr Peter Blizzard and it is a stunning reminder of the last 50 years. Generation after generation will be looking at that memorial sculpture. It has pride of place at Sturt Street. I know that the committee and the local community are extremely proud of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a plaque-unveiling and wreath-laying ceremony at Sebastopol and a wreath-laying ceremony at Clunes. The Ballarat committee organised a victory ball, which nearly 900 people attended. There was a victory parade and march in Ballarat from the RSL to the Town Hall, followed by an ecumenical service. There were celebrations at the Ballarat Grammar School. There was an 8/7 Battalion 137th birthday parade and a wreath-laying ceremony which commemorated the 80th anniversary of the VC awarded to William Dunstan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee organised, in conjunction with Legacy, two Legacy lunches for war widows. There were over 400 people at each of those lunches. They were a fantastic success. I heard the member for Dunkley talking about the booklet that his committee put out. I am sure many of us know the songs in it. If we did not grow up with them, we would certainly know them all very much off by heart after the last 12 months. I can see the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) nodding his head in agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Stawell sub-branch of the committee organised a VP concert, which was a fantastic night. It was held at the Stawell Secondary College. The young people there&mdash;indeed, two or three of the local performing groups&mdash;had a great input. The diggers day golf tournament was a great success in commemorating this 50th year. The Sebastopol RSL had a victory dinner, which I had the great pleasure to attend and speak at. It was a great night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without trying to single out any event during that time, there is no doubt that the Australia Remembers concert at Her Majesty's Theatre, at which there were 1,000 people, was a highlight. Five hundred people could not get tickets. A portion of that show was put on for the region's school children the next day, on the Monday. There was a capacity audience. The risk with these things is to try to pick out names, but it was made up basically of Ballarat or ex-Ballarat talent. There were people taking part in the concert who have performed in Melbourne, Sydney and New York. They are young men and women of whom we are extremely proud. They came back to Ballarat to do this concert, and I am sure that it will last a lifetime in the memory of every single person who was there. It was an absolutely fantastic afternoon. I cannot speak highly enough of it. </PARA>

If you speak to many of the women who were in the Women's Land Army and to women, now grandmothers, who in their early days were running a family farm while their men were overseas, you get some indication of the fact that it was a combined community effort 50 years ago. Of course, some paid the ultimate sacrifice and died on the battlefields outside this country, but others made their contributions at home.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the big problems facing all parliamentarians in state and federal politics is the issue of fuel pricing. There is a very great concern in the community, particularly in country and regional areas, about the high cost of fuel and the variations in fuel prices between regional and remote areas and city areas. Country residents are frequently required to pay from 7c to 14c a litre more than those in the city, despite regulation of maximum wholesale prices and transport costs. Fuel consumers in the city and country do not always have access to an effective, open, transparent and competitive market that stands the test of being fair to all consumers and free of discrimination. Fair and reasonable fuel prices for all consumers should be available, and something needs to be done to ensure that such a system is put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RACV and the Victorian Farmers Federation have done some excellent work on this and I would like to thank them for their contribution and their suggestions which I will briefly summarise. This may not be precisely what they said but it is the gist of it. They call for the establishment of an oil industry voluntary code of conduct involving the introduction of a form of terminal gate pricing designed to prevent unfair discrimination between the retailers of fuel in the country and those in the city. They wish to ensure that wholesale fuel prices are published daily so that everyone knows what they are, that oil companies are able to set the price for fuel at rates that recognise the commercial reality of price differences based on volume sales and terms of payment&mdash;there have to be some variations there&mdash;and that all wholesale purchasers have access to fuel at the published rate applicable to the volume of fuel and the terms of payment involved in the transaction. It is proposed by the RACV and the VFF that this would ensure that wholesale fuel would be offered at the prices at the various terminals to customers and, furthermore, that there would not be a difference based on the geographic area in which the customer operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something that I feel very strongly about is that oil terminals should be open to any potential customer with an appropriate authorised vehicle and qualified driver who is able to purchase and establish the credit that is needed in a commercial transaction to ensure normal commercial practices exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the RACV and the VFF, their members and many members of the public in Australia, particularly in country and regional areas, are crying out for the government to act to ensure that a new system of fuel sales is introduced into Australia and for this system to be monitored by the new Australian Competition and Consumer Commission so that, if evidence emerges of discrimination, uncompetitive practices or profiteering, this would give rise to immediate, prompt, appropriate action against those involved in such unfair and unacceptable practices. I believe that this suggestion by the RACV and the VFF should be examined by us all on a non-party political basis as it is worth while looking at. I believe the oil industry would find that this would also assist them in moving into the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the key point is that it is no longer acceptable to see fuel being sold in country areas only a few kilometres away from, say, the city of Melbourne at 7c to 14c a litre higher than the price in the city of Melbourne. Of course, we all understand that occasionally moves are made to gain market share and some marketing techniques are used that involve discounting. But, when the fluctuations in price are so large and occur so consistently, I believe that is prima facie evidence of a market force taking place which is not competitive, is certainly not transparent and which does discriminate. I am sure it is not in the commercial interests of anyone investing in the oil industry in Australia to be associated with practices that are becoming more and more abhorrent to the consumer. A good relationship between the consumer and the companies involved is the essence of the success of any future commercial enterprise. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Anyone with any business knowledge would say that this is foolhardiness in the extreme&mdash;and that is exactly what it is&mdash;by these councillors and council officers whom I must point out gave the advice to the councillors on what they should do with this land. Anyway, it was mortgaged to the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been trying to stop the sale of one of these packages of land called Central Car Park or Lawrey's paddock. I have had negotiations with the Commonwealth Bank and with the actual council. But it seems as though all my negotiations have gone straight out of the window and that they will sell this paddock. Lawrey's paddock was actually sold to the Frankston council back in 1945. I will read something from the local paper at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Councillor Fowler said there was a lot of commonsense in Councillor Reardon's suggestion but, unfortunately, the council was tied by the conditions under which the land was purchased.</PARA>

Now they want to sell this land, which was bought by the Frankston council at the time as a park for the people of Frankston. Another article from back in 1945 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only major achievement by the council he was able to recall was the acquiring of Lawrey's land for a park.</PARA>
<PARA>Why am I giving you the history of what happened back in 1945? Because we cannot find the contract of sale. I have been through all the council records. You would think that, with a large parcel of land, they would have the contract of sale, but it is not there. Where is it? No-one knows. We have been to the chief executive officer, but no-one can find it. I have been to have a look for it but I cannot find it anywhere in the records in relation to Lawrey's paddock. However, I have a letter here from the solicitor to Frankston council at the time, a Robert C. Taylor, which is dated 26 July 1945. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Re: the purchase from the estate of S. Lawrey.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 19th condition of the contract of sale dated 10 February 1945 provides that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>And it goes on about the cost. What are the other 18 conditions? Why can't I find this contract of sale? The reason why I cannot find it is that I believe someone has plucked it out of those records which have been held in the council and that it has been destroyed. I am searching for it and I will make certain that I have a campaign to save that land for the people of Frankston. These commissioners are there as caretakers. They are not to sell the assets which were given to the people of Frankston to be a green space, an open space. I will fight as much as I can. </PARA>

Mr Speaker, day by day it is becoming clearer that the House of Windsor fails this basic test. It is bad enough that Australia's head of state is not one of us. Australia's head of state is the monarch of another country. But, worse still, on all the objective evidence the institutions of the British monarchy are held out for public ridicule and public embarrassment. It is bad enough that Australia has borrowed the monarchy of another nation; worse still that the House of Windsor has shown itself to be an embarrassment in its own nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around the world people have come to the realisation that Prince Charles and his consorts&mdash;whichever one he finally settles on&mdash;are not fit to rule in Britain. What then must the international community think of Australia? What must they think of Australia&mdash;a nation of 17 million people&mdash;set to prefer Prince Charles as its head of state to each and every one of our own citizens? What must they think of Australians, given that Prince Charles, under our present constitutional arrangements, is deemed to be more suitable as our head of state than any of us?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the monarchy cannot command respect in Britain how can anyone think it is suitable for Australia? Why should we persevere with an institution which has destroyed itself through the personal manipulation, indulgence, intrigue and humiliation of the current generation of royals? Respect for Australia and our institutions demands a change to our constitution. We lose respect around the world and respect for each other when we take the monarchy of another nation as our head of state. We lose even more respect when we continue with an institution which has failed so comprehensively in its own country. Each of the members of the House of Windsor is a British citizen. Their standards of behaviour and public presentation over the past decade have shown them to be totally inappropriate to head Australia's constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not long ago the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott)&mdash;more British than the Brits, more royal than the royals, the youngest of the young fogies&mdash;described Prince Charles as `a man of international star quality'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that even the tories through the ages have acknowledged. The Liberal and National parties in this place have always supported a sense of social hierarchy and social order with the monarchy at the top.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How wrong they have been! How comprehensively wrong they have been! The system of hereditary monarchy is completely contrary to the belief that all people were born equal in status, dignity and opportunity. The rules of succession governing the British monarchy discriminate on the basis of religion, gender and birth. For the current generation of royals they also discriminate on the basis of capacity and suitability. There is one fundamental truth in this debate, that is, you cannot breed integrity and you cannot breed respect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, a quite outstandingly professional report on the administration of the ACT leasehold system was tabled in the ACT Legislative Assembly. I would like to draw the attention of this House to that report because we did a report on this subject some years ago and this is a particularly fine example of what a professional public inquiry can achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry examined many aspects of the leasehold system including, first of all, whether it should continue. The inquiry concluded that it should continue for very good reasons. The leasehold system avoids land speculation, it allows unearned increments to be retained by the government to defray the costs of the ACT, and it ensures orderly planning by lease purpose clauses. The committee also found that the leasehold system was very unlikely to frighten any investor off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret to say that the inquiry identified major problems in the administration of the leasehold system and the planning system in the ACT. It is chapter 17 which looks into the present administration. The committee makes a whole series of criticisms. For example, it says that it is not difficult to identify sources of community frustration with the process of development when reasonable requests are refused. We see a whole series of examples of situations where, under freedom of information legislation, people have applied for access to information about why decisions have been made and have been refused on quite unreasonable grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lack of disclosure of the interests of officers administering the system. The committee identifies problems of people who have had senior positions in the administration of land who have gone over and worked for the development sector. That obviously creates a conflict of interest. There are problems with compliance. There is a whole series of cases where lease purpose clauses have not been enforced. There have been complaints about that for years but still a lack of enforcement has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Failure to take steps to force the lessee to comply with the lease purpose clause has meant that for 15 years there was a blatant and continuing breach occurring. One could go on. A whole series of problems has been identified. The report goes on to make some practical, reasonable and intelligent proposals for dealing with this problem. For example, the report proposes setting up a separate statutory authority for the administration of land. It proposes that planning be set up as a separate statutory authority. It proposes that all the senior positions in those two areas be declared vacant and that they be advertised around Australia in an attempt to attract the best professional people into those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report had earlier expressed concern about the low level of training of people in those areas and the lack of experience in other parts of the Public Service and in the public sector. It is obviously very important to draw in people with a wide range of experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to conclude with a particular problem which concerns me greatly. I refer to an incident which occurred in relation to Gungahlin, an area where four suburbs have already been established. The previous ACT government clearly intended that a department would be located in that area in order to create employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the period just before the election the public servants arbitrarily and unilaterally decided that the Department of Environment, Land and Planning would be located in Dickson, close to the centre of Canberra. That defeated the proposal which would have had the effect of increasing employment opportunities in Gungahlin. That was done entirely contrary to the declared intention of the former government and before a new government could be elected. It was an absolutely improper action by the public servants. The committee stated that on the basis of that example alone it is possible to conclude that a major planning decision was made in direct contradiction to government policy and political direction at the highest level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was disgraceful. It is important that the people who were involved in that decision are made to explain it and, if necessary, be expected to resign.</PARA>

<PARA>Superannuation is the central pillar of the government's strategy to boost retirement incomes and raise national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of government reforms, most working Australians are now covered by superannuation. Regular contributions being made today will generate higher retirement incomes in the future. The growth of superannuation savings is encouraged by generous tax concessions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's decision to promote superannuation brings important responsibilities for the financial sector. Financial institutions and advisers must explain the benefits of long-term investment in a diversified portfolio. To encourage the industry to take a longer-term view on investments, the government now requires that funds report their average returns for the past five years, as well as individual figures for each of those years. Most importantly, fund managers must justify the government's decision to have superannuation managed in the private sector by investing responsibly and delivering strong fund performance over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's commitment to improving superannuation coverage and the adequacy of end benefits is matched by an equally strong commitment to enhancing the security of member entitlements. A sound regulatory framework of `checks and balances' is essential for maintaining public confidence in superannuation and ensuring the long-term success of the government's retirement incomes policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's prudential framework is embodied in the superannuation industry supervision, or SIS, legislation. The SIS regime makes it clear that trustees are legally responsible for running their funds in the best interests of fund members. A key duty of trustees under SIS is to implement an investment strategy which takes account of the fund's circumstances. The strategy must have regard to the trade-off between risk and return, the benefits of having a diversified investment portfolio, and the fund's capacity to meet its liquidity needs and future liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that the trustee's role is a central one and has made great efforts to educate trustees about their responsibilities. This program of education is continuing, and will continue in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many cases, trustees retain fund managers to invest superannuation money. The government considers that fund managers need to find ways to invest in a broader range of businesses, rather than concentrating their equity investments on blue-chip stocks. For example, fund managers should consider placing a portion of their investments in small, innovative businesses. This will potentially yield better returns for investors, as well as contributing to the economic wellbeing of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purposes of this bill are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.to expand and strengthen the jurisdiction of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.to ensure that fund auditors certify that funds comply with certain provisions of the SI(S) Act and regulations;  and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.to transfer various modification orders made by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner into the body of the SI(S) Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I would now like to expand on each of these elements of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Superannuation Complaints Tribunal</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Integral to the SIS regime is the requirement that members have access to both their fund's internal complaints handling arrangements and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The government set up the tribunal last year to provide fund members with low cost, informal and speedy dispute resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tribunal has made sound progress in its first year. In the 12 months ending June 1995, the tribunal received a total of 416 written complaints that were within its jurisdiction. Around a quarter of these were resolved, with the balance still in the statutorily-based inquiry and conciliation phases as at the end of the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the tribunal has been subject to some criticism relating to the statutory limits on its jurisdiction. These limits have caused a large number of complaints to be excluded by the tribunal on the grounds that they could not be handled under existing legislative constraints. Included amongst these were complaints about disability benefits involving the assessment of medical evidence and certain complaints about life office superannuation products. This bill aims to improve the effectiveness of the tribunal by clarifying and strengthening its jurisdiction over these kinds of complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Complaints about disability claims are set to be handled by the tribunal from 1 November 1995, when the regulation excluding the consideration of `medical evidence' expires. This bill will enhance the effectiveness of the tribunal handling medical evidence complaints in two important ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it will protect the members of funds that arrange disability cover through an external insurer, by enabling the tribunal to make orders directly against the insurer. This means funds will not face the unfunded liabilities which could otherwise arise where a fund is ordered to pay a disability benefit that has been rejected by its external insurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the bill puts in place various time limits to prevent the tribunal's being swamped with intractable `old' disability complaints where the trail of medical evidence has gone cold: that is, where the illness or injury which led to a claim may have been obscured by subsequent complications or a new condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly, the tribunal will not be able to consider complaints about disability claims decided by fund trustees before 1 November 1994. Given that I announced the tribunal would deal with `medical evidence' complaints in October 1994, the amendments are essentially prospective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To further enhance the tribunal's efficiency in this area, the government will also support the development of `best practice' guidelines for disability claims handling by the superannuation industry. The peak industry associations are consulting closely with the tribunal and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to develop these guidelines, which will be published by way of a circular. Although compliance with these guidelines will be voluntary, it is expected that they will promote better decision making by funds and insurers, thereby minimising the volume of `medical evidence' complaints made to the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to life office superannuation, it was always the government's intention that the tribunal should have coverage over all superannuation products, including those offered by life offices. Unfortunately, the legislation did not give full or certain effect to this intention, and the tribunal has been unable to effectively deal with a common source of complaint, namely, allegations about life office agent misrepresentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill rectifies this problem by enabling the tribunal to deal with complaints about superannuation-related annuity products and life office agent misrepresentation. Where the sale of a life office superannuation policy was unfair or unreasonable, the bill enables the tribunal to order the cancellation, variation or repayment of the policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to cover life office superannuation are fully prospective, in that the tribunal's new jurisdiction will apply only to life products purchased after royal assent. People with complaints about life products purchased before that date can pursue their concerns through the life industry complaints scheme, as at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government recognises that life offices have a strong presence in the highly competitive retail superannuation market, and that allegations of life agent misrepresentation have been a source of particular concern. However, they are not the only public offer superannuation providers, and it is important that all market players be treated equally before the tribunal, to the extent that that is appropriate and practicable. To this end, further amendments will be made at the earliest opportunity in 1996, to ensure that, as far as possible, the new remedies for sale misconduct are extended to all public offer superannuation providers and intermediaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expanding the tribunal's jurisdiction through the amendments in this bill will add considerably to the tribunal's overall workload. In anticipation of this, the bill provides for the creation of a new full-time deputy chairperson position and two additional part-time member positions. Together with the recent upgrading of the tribunal's secretariat, these measures demonstrate the government's strong commitment to ensuring that the tribunal is able to fulfil its charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has carefully examined the High Court decision of Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, handed down in February this year, and is satisfied that the existing legislation and the proposed amendments will not involve the tribunal's exercising judicial power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments which I will move during the debate will remove age limits for the chairperson and deputy chairperson of the tribunal, in line with the government's recently announced general approach in this area. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Compliance audits</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second main element of the bill is amendments to enhance the prudential supervision of the superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends the SI(S) Act to require that fund trustees arrange for a qualified auditor to carry out yearly compliance audits. A fund's auditor will be required to certify that the fund complies with certain requirements of the SI(S) Act and regulations. The trustee is then required to pass on that report to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This external check builds on existing audit requirements in the SIS regime. Auditors are already required to sign off on a fund's financial statements. They are also subject to whistleblower provisions which force auditors to report  suspected breaches of the law to the ISC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tougher audit rules are supplemented by the ISC's own program of audits to check that funds comply with prudential rules and are run in the best interests of fund members. The ISC conducted nearly 800 fund audits around Australia in 1994-95. Taken together, these measures will help protect the interests of fund members. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Transfer of modification orders</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill transfers into the SI(S) Act various modification orders made by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner under part 29 of the act. Many of the modification orders that are being transferred are temporary orders expiring on 30 June 1996. Accordingly, unless they are transferred into the body of the SI(S) Act they will cease to have effect on that date, causing substantial disruption to industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The modification orders are generally made to deal with transitional or technical problems in the legislation which are having unintended effects on industry. They provide an avenue for the commissioner to appropriately respond to such problems in the interim period before parliamentary amendments to the legislation can be made. The modification orders being transferred relate to a number of varied matters, and their inclusion in the body of the SI(S) Act will improve the clarity and effectiveness of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transfer of these modification orders into the SI(S) Act reflects the government's belief that modification orders made by the commissioner should be incorporated into the body of the act at the earliest possible opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial impact</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is probably my final speech on the subject of superannuation in this parliament. It is a field that I entered back in about 1981 when the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, appointed me as the chairman of a task force to examine a number of important reports which had been tabled on superannuation reform. Unfortunately, the election in March 1983 interrupted the Fraser government's examination of my report. Mr Keating&mdash;now Prime Minister&mdash;came forward with his proposals in June of the same year. So, while it was claimed by the government that they were the founders of the major changes in superannuation policy, it is important to point out that some basic work was done prior to the change of government which of course they were able to benefit from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is not opposing the substance of these amendments. They are quite significant in their own right, and I support the view of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) that issues relating to the regulatory framework for superannuation are of primary importance. It is also, of course, quite relevant that the major issue of superannuation is clearly going to be a subject for continuing debate leading up to the next election. The fact that the government has appointed the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Con Sciacca, to be involved in this exercise demonstrates that it takes this matter as seriously as the opposition does. I would say to Mr Sciacca, who is not in the chamber, that I think he will find dealing with the esoterics of superannuation considerably more difficult than selling Australia Remembers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation&mdash;the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995&mdash;does contain four major areas of review: expanding the jurisdiction and improving the effectiveness of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal; transferring various modification orders made by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner into the body of the SI(S) Act; requiring audits of superannuation entities to cover compliance with certain provisions of the SI(S) Act and its regulations; and making other miscellaneous amendments to the SI(S) Act, the SRC Act and the SET Act, primarily aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of those acts and the system of prudential supervision of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in relation to the extension of the SCT jurisdiction expand the jurisdiction of the complaints tribunal. This is very important because it is important to consider the reality that medical evidence is of particular significance in many cases where people have complaints with their superannuation intermediaries or companies, and matters relating to decisions taken in that context will be covered by these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing tribunal opened in July 1994 to hear complaints about procedural fairness, with the intention that it would be exempted from hearing cases involving the interpretation of medical evidence. This was in line with the recommendation made by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation in October 1993. The concern was that the tribunal would be swamped by complaints involving conflicting medical evidence which could not be readily resolved, thereby bogging down the tribunal's progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1994, opposition senators voted to disallow the regulation exempting medical evidence cases on the basis that the regulation unfairly prevented people with disabilities from having access to a low cost dispute mechanism, and following a review by the Senate select committee which concluded that it was not convinced that there was not a role for the tribunal to play in the consideration of medical complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer announced that the SCT would be able to handle medical complaints from 1 May 1995, following consultations with interested parties concerning possible approaches. The coalition agreed to provide the government with this six-month period of grace. In April 1995 an agreement was reached to extend the period for a further six months, following uncertainty about the SCT powers in relation to disputes following the High Court's decision in Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Others. In the light of Brandy, the bill amends the act to remove a number of grounds on which a complaint could be made which could have been construed as judicial in character. The jurisdiction of the SCT is limited by the bill to deciding whether a decision is, or was, unfair or unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill enables the SCT to review complaints relating to the payment of disability benefits if the trustee's decision was made on or after 1 November 1994. There have been some suggestions that the date should be prospective. An extension of jurisdiction to cover life office products is also an important area of reform. Last October, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer indicated that legislation would be expedited to ensure that the SCT had jurisdiction to deal with complaints involving life office superannuation products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill inserts a new subsection 14A(1) which enables a person who has an interest in a life policy fund to complain to the SCT that the decision of the trustee to admit the person to the fund was unfair or unreasonable. This has the effect of allowing persons who have suffered misconduct&mdash;for example, misrepresentation at the hands of life office agents&mdash;to obtain redress. The issue came to a point a few years ago when unsatisfactory policies were being sold to Aborigines on Palm Island in Queensland and demonstrated the type of issues which can arise in this context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was always the government's intention that the SCT would have this power but doubts existed as to whether the tribunal was able to apply them in the context of drafting the legislation. However, there is no equivalent right to complain to the tribunal in the event of mis-selling or undue influence, et cetera, in association with the sale of a non-life insurance superannuation product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the parliamentary secretary is no doubt aware, brokers and financial planners are increasingly marketing superannuation products through master trusts. The question therefore does have to be asked: why was the extension of the tribunal's jurisdiction in this case limited to life offices? Has the government seen the amendments proposed by the Life, Investment and Superannuation Association of Australia, LISA, and, if so, what is the government planning to do with the amendments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am well aware of the fact that there is not total agreement between the financial industry or financial intermediaries and their representatives as to what the content of any further amendments ought to be. We have agreed to allow the passage of the legislation despite the fact that there are some areas yet to be covered. We believe it is essential that issues specifically relating to the marketing of superannuation products, through master trusts and elsewhere, should be closed off at the first available opportunity. This is at least a step in the right direction, but I place on record that we believe further work has to be done in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the question of jurisdiction extended to cover annuities. The bill also inserts a new subsection 15A(1) enabling a person who has an interest in an annuity policy to complain to the SCT that the conduct of the insurer or representative of the insurer during the sale process was unfair or unreasonable. For a long time annuities were not regarded as being part of the superannuation system but it is fair to say that that is no longer the general view. In a generic sense, annuities are certainly regarded within the industry and by consumers as part of superannuation. It is only consistent, therefore, that they should be treated in the same context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to other changes in this particular area, there have been some changes to the tribunal arrangements so that the workload will be adequately covered by an additional deputy chairperson. As the parliamentary secretary is well aware, I have already identified the fact, as he has recently done, that we would also like to move an amendment eliminating the reference to age. It is quite absurd that people should be prevented from serving as chairpersons, representatives or part-time or full-time members of the SCT, especially in a context of the fact that the opposition, through my own efforts in the lower House, and in the Senate, has now put forward no fewer than four bills to remove age discrimination. Those bills have passed through the Senate and they have had their first reading in the House of Representatives but they have gone no further, because the government has refused to act on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few weeks ago I was pleased to note that the cabinet finally decided that it was time to remove age discrimination from public sector employment. I intimated this to the parliamentary secretary's office and I am pleased to see that he has also drafted an amendment to achieve the same object. I suppose it is a case of who gets there first, but I want to place on record that it was my amendment, even if the representative of government gets up there first. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is very kind. In terms of the modification orders, part 29 of the SI(S) Act empowers the commissioner to grant exemptions from and to make modifications to certain provisions of the act and its regulations. This will enable the commissioner to quickly address problems as they arise and he may issue either a modification declaration or a temporary modification declaration. However, the latter will have no effect after 30 June 1996 and the subject matter of a temporary modification declaration order can only be retained after this date after it is legislated. It will be interesting to see how that applies in fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the question of temporary modification to declaration No. 14, which generated some concern when it was released. This declaration allows the commissioner to consider the case in favour of a person who has received a minor conviction some years previously&mdash;for example, smoking pot at university&mdash;and who would therefore be unable to become a superannuation trustee, and determine, given the minor nature of the offence and the fact that any reasonable observer would conclude that the conviction is not relevant to the likelihood of the person acting imprudently and dishonestly in the future, that the `disqualified person' provisions should be waived. We do not disagree with that. Presumably, in many cases, the punishment has fitted the crime and a person should not be held accountable indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a related matter, I have, at various stages, raised the question of whether trustees should be paid. I think this is an area that needs further examination. In some cases they do receive small emoluments but overall there seems to be a tendency not to remunerate trustees except in terms of costs incurred. The problem I see is simply that we are now reaching a situation where some of the larger funds&mdash;CBUS and others&mdash;will have a million or more contributors and they will be controlling well in excess of $1 billion worth of assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many respects the question of the training of trustees, and their overall fitness to conduct the operations, will be a matter of growing importance and significance. Therefore, I think there needs to be a serious examination of the trustee codes, with particular reference to the appointment of outsiders. At the moment, it is restricted so that the trustees must be people who have a direct association with the trust. There may well be a case in the future to consider the expansion of this concept. Just as we appoint experts as directors of companies, the same principle may well have to be applied when appointing trustees of super funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the question of compliance audits. The bill requires trustees to arrange for an auditor to give the trustee a report of the operations of the fund in the approved form. This must include a statement by the auditor that the fund complies with certain provisions of the SI(S) Act and regulations. The bill enables the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to disqualify any auditor who fails to adequately and properly perform any of their SI(S) functions. The amendments also empower the commissioner to refer a matter to an auditor's professional association for appropriate disciplinary action. This amendment gives the commissioner an option, other than or in addition to a disqualification, to deal with auditors who in the commissioner's opinion have failed to carry out their duties. Relevant professional associations are also provided with a mechanism whereby they can reprimand auditors. These amendments ensure that auditors are more likely to do their job properly but, again, that remains to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is terribly important to emphasise the fact that, to date, fortunately, there have not been any serious failures of superannuation funds. One would be taking an extraordinary risk if one was to assume that that situation will continue indefinitely. That is why the issues of fiduciary relationship and overall compliance are of fundamental importance. One of the issues, and the SI(S) Act establishes the framework to achieve this, is the need to ensure that the regulatory framework, which is essential for public confidence in superannuation, is applied as rigorously as possible while, at the same time, it does not create unnecessary difficulties for those who have to manage superannuation funds, with all the onerous responsibilities which they carry with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been considerable debate in recent times about trustees and fund managers. The Prime Minister has attacked fund managers, calling them `lemmings' and `donkeys' for failing to adopt a more adventurous approach to investment for superannuation funds. I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment relating to these attacks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those attacks by the Prime Minister lie rather strangely with statements he has made over many years with regard to the management of superannuation funds. His attack has ignored a number of fundamental truths. Superannuation fund trustees have a fiduciary duty to fund members. They are accountable for forming an investment strategy that has regard to all aspects of the particular fund. Trustees have the sole responsibility of representing member interests and, consequently, fund managers who fail to perform are&mdash;and should be&mdash;sacked. But it is essential to remember that trustees are required to invest solely for the purpose of providing a retirement benefit for fund members, and fund members only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation fund money is not a commodity or public asset, and there is neither a legal nor a moral right of control over superannuation assets by anyone other than fund members and their trustees. The `sole purpose' obligation of trustees under the SI(S) Act requires superannuation investments to be made only for the purpose of providing retirement benefits for fund members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any deflection therefore of superannuation investment from its primary purpose in order to achieve a social or any other worthwhile goal has the potential to negate the ability of superannuation to realise the retirement income policy objectives on which it is founded. Normal strategy is for trustees to give fund managers general directions. They invest in bonds, both domestic and overseas, in shares in Australian or overseas industries, resource stocks with a heavy emphasis on blue-chip stocks, cash for investment in the money market, and, more recently, in home mortgages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trustees normally give specific mandates for investment with heavy emphasis on protecting contributors. Fund managers endeavour to trade in Australian equities and to do better than the market. That is why there is a great emphasis on blue chips, which are also highly transferable and assist managers to keep management fees low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal players and intermediaries in SMEs are the direct private investors, the so-called `business angels', institutional investors and the specialist intermediaries in SME based investments, for example, venture/development capital funds. These formal funds are dealing with other people's money and are therefore subject to fiduciary responsibilities, due diligence requirements and, in the case of the major institutional investors, prudential supervision by the ISC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted the comment made by the parliamentary secretary about the fact that trustees and fund managers should be more adventurous; they should look for a spread of investments to small and intermediate investments. Again, it is fine to be able to stand up here in parliament and make those observations when you are not actually responsible for the outcome, when you do not actually have to face up to the trustees and explain why it was that your investments in SMEs or in investments other than blue chip did not return what you regard as an adequate level of benefit at that time. Unfortunately, the trustees do not see it necessarily in that light, even if they set the guidelines against which the investment policy should be based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These `angels' that I referred to are dealing essentially with their own money. As a consequence, `angels' tend to rely on their own judgment, and are willing to invest in the earlier stages of SME development and small investment opportunities. However, the venture/development capital funds are forced by their higher cost structures to seek investments in excess of at least $1 million to $2 million and have moved increasingly towards latter stage investments which carry lower risk and less uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In an article published in the April edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Superfunds</EMPHASIS>, it was suggested that the development capital industry is suffering from a lack of the type of information which gives trustees confidence in other investments. Development capital needs better long-term, consistent and independently researched data to reassure conservative trustees because development capital has some odd characteristics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, development capital can be imprecise in terms of valuations. There can be frequent slowness in delivering financial returns in the early stages of investment. Trustees need to be reassured that this is not unusual and is still consistent with their initial expectation of superior risk adjusted returns. Scepticism about investment development capital is often related to the absence of signposts such as short-term performance figures or benchmarks which trustees have become used to in their dealings with more traditional asset classes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the fundamental differences between investing in so-called blue-chip investments and investing in these more speculative areas is simply this. You can ring up, at a moment's notice, any reputable broker in Australia and they can give you a detailed analysis of all the major companies on the Australian Stock Exchange list. But, if you want to make investments in, as they say, more speculative areas, immediate information in most cases simply does not exist. One of the only sources you have is those companies or those brokers who were specifically involved in the launch of a new project, where there is often a tendency to gild lilies, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is quite clearly a fundamental difference in terms of the availability of accurate information upon which those financial judgments can be made which must be taken into account. Leaving aside the glib rhetoric from prime ministers or ministers here representing the government, it is not easy for a fund manager to make those decisions, because that is where the buck stops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, superannuation funds are also seeking investment opportunities in private investments, an asset class that includes infrastructure, development capital and direct investments in resources and other projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you an example of this. The largest investor company in Australia, as we know, is the AMP. It has committed $500 million to investment in infrastructure and has an additional $150 million from other funds. The AMP has also established a business development fund of $100 million to invest directly in unlisted small and medium enterprises. One can legitimately criticise $500 million or so in the overall total of the AMP's $36 billion of funds; it does seem to be rather low. Nevertheless, let us look at the breakdown of those funds. Under management the AMP has $12 billion invested in Australia equities, $3.2 billion in foreign equities, $6 billion in property, $7.3 billion in fixed interest, $1.8 billion in inflation index linked securities, $3.8 billion in cash and $1.7 billion in direct resource investments. This aggregate allocation reflects the individual asset allocation strategies applied in each of the separate funds managed by the AMP. In other words, a client can come in and explicitly say, `That is the range of investments I want,' and they can buy into a fund on that basis. Equally it follows that they have to accept the responsibility that the fund may or may not perform in accordance with expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Prime Minister, and others who wish to speak rather loosely in this area, would do well to read the report of the private infrastructure task force, which points to the emergence of specialist infrastructure investment funds offering a spread of project risks, to the development of the inflation indexed bond market and to the first public listing of an infrastructure project, which was the M2 motorway in Sydney. Clearly there are going to be far more infrastructure projects in the future, and with all of these projects, as we understand how they operate and how they can be funded and so forth, there will be new opportunities arising both for information about them and to help trustees make decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally in this particular context, a report from the National Investment Council entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financing growth</EMPHASIS>, released in August of this year, noted that, while SMEs generate around 40 per cent of Australia's private sector output and account for about half of private employment, there are significant impediments which limit the effective flow of funds to SMEs. Rather than a shortage of capital for infrastructure investment, there is a shortage of projects which meet the hurdle rates of return and risk characteristics for suitable investments. So fundamentally we come back to that issue: can you get a better return from putting your money in blue chips, which are transferable almost at a moment's notice, or is it worth taking these additional risks in a quest for infrastructure investments and for other suitable investments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report found that only about 10 per cent of SMEs aspire to significant growth and only about 30 per cent of those are willing to take external equity. Furthermore, most growth firms seeking equity are not looking for investment. They are not `investment ready'&mdash;that is, they fail to meet fundamental requirements to be attractive to external investors. For instance, they have not separated their business and personal affairs, they depend on one key individual or they have not established a sustainable market niche. Many SMEs are not aware of what is required to be investment ready. In a recent BRW article entitled `Where none but angels dare to tread'&mdash;a very appropriate title&mdash;a financier stated that the problem has little to do with money but lies with the inability of the typical owner-manager of an SME to communicate, that business plans are often ineffective and that much of what is in them cannot be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the point which also needs to be re-emphasised is that the evidence is quite clear that most small operators are seeking cheap borrowing capacity. They are not seeking equity. I repeat: they are not seeking equity. There needs to be a re-education at both ends of the spectrum, in terms of the SMEs so they understand that there are alternative forms of financing, including equity financing or partial equity financing, which should be looked at, as well as the issue of greater information in the hands of the trustees and the fund managers. Consequently, out of all of this, the National Investment Council recommended that SMEs must be assisted to become more investment ready. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study conducted by Catalyst Investment Managers Pty Ltd, an established development fund manager, which was undertaken to test the feasibility of a regionally focused investment fund that would assist the growth of some 3,500-plus small and medium sized manufacturers in the greater western suburbs of Sydney&mdash;and I am sure that the parliamentary secretary will be well aware of this&mdash;highlighted a substantial demand for capital. However&mdash;and this is a point I have just made&mdash;most of the respondents favoured non-institutional sources of capital. Only 23 per cent would consider raising equity from an institutional source. Consequently, the question has to be asked: could the government do any better?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three years ago the government launched the pooled development fund scheme as part of an economic package to pull the economy out of recession. Earnings from funds invested in a registered PDF would be taxed at a concessional rate, so we were told. To qualify, investment companies had to agree to invest the money they raised in small developing companies. But, sadly, it is fair to say that this scheme has not reached its expectations, nor would most people regard it as having been a success overall. The tax concession was too small and the constraints on the type of investments that PDFs could make in the scheme were clearly unattractive. Very few companies applied for PDF registration and, of those that did, many struggled to find funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the solutions. Rather than directing members' funds or fiddling with tax concessions and making yet more radical changes to the superannuation system, the quality and diversity of superannuation investments would improve if member choice was extended. Ian Chalmers, in a paper entitled `Yours, mine or ours?: Is there a case for directed superannuation investment?' stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beneficiary Investment Choice provides the option for individual fund members to select investment strategies most suited to their own circumstances, preferences and longer term retirement funding objectives. Within these constraints, the availability of BIC "social investment" options, provided they satisfy the fiduciary obligations of fund trustees, may facilitate an increased flow of investment capital to public benefit projects, without undermining the inalienable right of fund members to obtain the maximum economic return from the investment of their retirement saving.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, funds which do not offer BIC fail to fully accommodate the differing risk/return requirements of their members. This inevitably exposes those well short of retirement to an investment approach of unnecessary (and ultimately costly) conservatism, or alternatively, those closer to retirement to investments of inappropriate volatility.</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, while accountability and reporting standards have improved, many fund members are denied the right to shift their savings from a fund with which they are dissatisfied to an alternative superannuation fund of their choice. This absence of choice prevents fund members from moving to a fund which complies with the members' particular requirements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to contribute to the debate upon the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill before the House today. Superannuation is one of those issues which are very important to us all, and certainly to the broader Australian community. The bill has four main purposes, which have been well canvassed earlier by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott). Those purposes cover expanding the jurisdiction and improving the effectiveness of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal; transferring various modification orders made by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner into the body of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993; requiring audits of superannuation entities to cover compliance with certain provisions of the SI(S) Act and the regulations; and making other miscellaneous amendments to the SI(S) Act, the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 and the Superannuation Entities (Taxation) Act 1987, amendments which are primarily aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of those acts and the system of prudential supervision of the superannuation industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of these proposed amendments, which totals approximately $980,000, would see the creation of a deputy chairperson and two part-time members for the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, the introduction of a new case management system and further additional resources for the tribunal. These amendments will supplement the prudentially sound regulatory framework that this Labor government has put in place over the past 12 years as part of its development of a comprehensive national superannuation scheme. Since its election in 1983, the Labor government has radically transformed retirement savings in this country to a point where the comprehensive system now in place will, in the long term, increase retirement incomes and national savings. The work of this government is something of which Australians can be very proud, and I myself am certainly pleased to be part of that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to 1983, as I am sure you would be well aware, superannuation was the preserve of a minority of Australians. The vast majority of Australian workers did not have access to superannuation to supplement their retirement incomes. This government, in pursuit of a fair and equitable retirement income policy for all Australians, has to a large extent remedied this situation through a number of key policy initiatives. The 1985 Accord with the ACTU played a pivotal role in this process, through a universal three per cent employer-provided superannuation benefit in lieu of an equivalent productivity based general wage rise. That is one point that is often forgotten in the superannuation debate. It was the workers themselves who actually started off their contribution with that three per cent, by forgoing a wage rise. I think we need to continue to remind some of those opposite that that contribution was made by the workers of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The award based superannuation system, which emanated from the subsequent national wage case decision in 1986, saw access to superannuation extended from a base of 39 per cent in 1983 to one of 72 per cent of employees by July 1991. To supplement the development of award based superannuation, the government introduced in the 1991 budget the superannuation guarantee, to further extend the coverage of superannuation for employees and to ensure compliance amongst employers in meeting their superannuation obligations to employees. The combination of award based superannuation and the superannuation guarantee has increased coverage to over 90 per cent of the Australian work force as at October 1995. Indeed, by the year 2002, under the superannuation guarantee schedule of rates, workers will receive an employer superannuation support equivalent to nine per cent of their salary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable members opposite last sat on the Treasury bench, only 39 per cent of the work force was covered by superannuation. I think you would agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that is a damning indictment of the opposition's retirement income policy at that time. Clearly, it did not require the powers of a soothsayer to see the potential of superannuation in the future direction of retirement income and savings policy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the government's 1995-96 budget, further initiatives were put in place to build upon our comprehensive retirement income and national savings plan for the future. In this context, from 1997, variations to awards will see the introduction of employee contributions to superannuation paid out of future wage rises. Contributions amounting to three per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings will be phased in over three years. This phasing-in period will reduce undue pressure on wages and cost and should see no discernible reduction in disposable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To complement the three per cent phased employee superannuation contributions, the government will match, dollar for dollar, employee contributions with direct payments to workers' superannuation accounts, by paying the second round of the One Nation tax cuts in this form. The matching payments will be capped at three per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings, and a means test will gradually withdraw support to the salary in the range of up to $65,000 per annum. Consequently, by the year 2000, it is estimated that the government will be paying around $4.5 billion per year into the superannuation accounts of workers. By the year 2020, the government's superannuation plan will add $18 billion each year to the national savings. In this context, employees will be saving 15 per cent of their salary through superannuation contributions, which will result in higher retirement incomes in the long term and will certainly ensure that Australians are assured of a sound retirement&mdash;something that we all aim for in our later years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present time, the Australian superannuation industry has assets of approximately $190 billion. This savings pool is a basis for the future expansion of this nation's economy, which will be critical if we are going to be able to compete in the international marketplace. We are all well aware of this government's commitment to that end, and certainly of the efforts of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) over the last week or so to ensure Australia's place, particularly in our own region, in an international marketplace. Over the next five years, by the year 2001, the combined effect of all the government's superannuation measures to date will boost national savings by an estimated two per cent of GDP, or $8.2 billion. It is estimated that the savings impact of superannuation by the year 2006 will be approximately $12.4 billion, or three per cent of GDP and, by the year 2021, four per cent of GDP, which will be $16.6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the government's current policy settings, superannuation assets are projected to increase tenfold in the next 25 years. This is a substantial savings pool in anybody's language. With workers' hard-earned savings being invested by superannuation funds to secure increased returns on their retirement savings, the government has, as I said earlier, put in place the regulatory framework to ensure that the funds operate in a prudentially sound manner. To this end, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill, which is before the House today, will add to the overall effectiveness of the legislation already enacted by this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 primarily encompass the audit requirements of superannuation entities, the application of Corporations Law provisions and the powers of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Under the new amendments, key enhancements to audit requirements will provide for copies of audit certificates, rather than originals, to be provided to the commissioner when an annual return is lodged; for a statement of cash flows to be prepared for superannuation entities to allow auditors' reports to relate to more than the accounts and statements currently referred to in part 13; for the auditor's report to include the auditor's opinion on the compliance of the entity with specified provisions of the act and the regulations; and for clarification of the circumstances in which an auditor may be disqualified and in which an auditor or actuary must tell the trustee that they believe there is a contravention of the act or that the financial position of the entity is, or may become, unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Complementing the amendments relating to the audit requirements of superannuation entities, elements of Corporations Law practice are also incorporated into the act. These include provision for the SI(S) Act to become consistent with the terminology relating to official management used in part 5.3A of the Corporations Law; the prohibiting of `disqualified persons' from being `responsible persons' of bodies corporate which are trustees, investment managers or custodians of superannuation entities, unless a waiver has been granted by the commissioner; and the requirement that all investments by superannuation entities be maintained on an arms-length basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the powers of the commissioner under the SI(S) Act, the amendments will provide for the commissioner to refer an actuary or auditor to a professional body for disciplinary action; for the commissioner to make an application to the court for an order to be made against a trustee for the protection of beneficiaries, without the need for an investigation, prosecution or civil proceedings to have begun; and for approved deposit funds with the consent of the commissioner to become regulated superannuation funds without losing their taxation concessions. Supplementing these changes to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, the bill before the House today will also make a number of important amendments to the operation of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993, which of course was put in place by the government to deal with complaints about the operation of the superannuation industry in a fair and equitable manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end the changes which flow from the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill will supplement the powers of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal in dealing with problems which are brought to its attention. In this context the key amendments will reinforce the powers of the tribunal by enabling the tribunal to review and make determinations in respect of insurance decisions relating to death and disability benefits and ensure they are provided through regulated superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will empower the tribunal to review life office conduct and decisions in relation to the sale and management of superannuation related annuity products, allow the tribunal to review decisions as to whether and to what extent a person is totally and permanently disabled, and provide for the appointment of a deputy chairperson and two additional part-time members to assist the tribunal in dealing with the increased volume and complexity of complaints which are expected as a result of these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Complementing these changes, amendments to both the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1973 will see the bodies corporate authorised to carry on insurance business and life insurance complaints being required to comply with determinations of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal through the modification of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the government's hard work in the area of superannuation has ensured that a whole new generation of Australians will have access to a superannuation system which is not only prudentially sound but one which will also ensure that they are going to be financially independent when they enter retirement. Indeed, if we believe what the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) has been saying in recent weeks, it would now seem that even the opposition parties have finally seen the light and are supportive of the government's superannuation policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But given that the coalition has previously described the government's superannuation policies as being vicious, mindless social and economic disasters, a confiscation of assets and a tax on jobs, one must wonder about their change in attitude. I have seen enough reports in the media over recent weeks to make me wonder whether they are really fair dinkum about what they are saying. I wonder whether they have really seen the light after all or whether it is just a cynical attempt to disguise a more sinister set of policies which would seek to dismantle the comprehensive national savings system we have put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has seen before what the coalition has managed to do when it talks about not dismantling things. Go back to the days of the Fraser government. Look what they promised about Medicare in those days. Have they got the same thing in mind for superannuation? Given the coalition's previous track record, the second of these scenarios would seem more likely. Indeed, if you look at the superannuation proposals floated by the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the member for Higgins in relation to allowing the banks to directly compete in the superannuation marketplace, the effects upon the comprehensive system already in place would be deleterious to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the comments by people in the media and people in the industry itself over recent weeks have been quite interesting. If the coalition were, unfortunately for the Australian people, ever to get hold of the Treasury bench again, then the criticisms that have come forward from a lot of the commentators about that would be quite interesting. On face value the proposals sound very nice and sound a very easy way to operate, but on close analysis it is seen that they really are flawed, and very much so. </PARA>

<PARA>Of course, that is another initiative taken by this government, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) was instrumental in that legislation. I congratulate him on that. Mr Whittaker then went on a bit further in the same article to simply tear apart any notion along that line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn quickly to the other points the coalition was talking about in regard to allowing banks into superannuation. At first glance, that makes a lot of sense too but, on the other side of the coin, banks are already into that field through their own subsidiaries and there is no real need to go down that path. If those sorts of funds were in the banking system, they would all be subject to the normal bank lending criteria and they would not come under the control that is offered by the protection of the superannuation industry that we are debating today, a protection further enhancing the safety of members' funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees probably summed it up best in an information paper it prepared where it stated:</PARA>

<PARA>When the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) was speaking earlier about his amendment, which I reject out of hand and I know the government does as well, he chose to attack the Prime Minister for trying to encourage some fund managers to invest more wisely in this country. The honourable member's suggestion that it is the members' funds that we should be considering really makes a joke of what he is saying in his amendment because the risk is found in the opposition's own proposed policies.

One thing to remember about Mr Whittaker is that he is a professional adviser whose income derives from advising people how to invest their funds. If RSAs became part of the total retirement income scheme of things, Mr Whittaker would not be in a position to make much money out of them. He said in his column that RSAs were to be deplored and he gave an interesting example. He quoted a return of four per cent on an RSA and compared that with nine per cent in a super fund. Blind Freddy knows that if you are going to get four per cent on an RSA it is not going to match nine per cent in a super fund, except that, if you look at the super funds these days, they are not returning four per cent after Labor's up-front 15 per cent tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill was introduced into the chamber on 19 October, 1995. It sets out to amend four principal acts, namely the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act of 1993, the SI(S) Act, the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993, the S(RC) Act, the Superannuation Entities (Taxation) Act 1987, the SE(T) Act, the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the explanatory memorandum points out, the bill has four main aims. The first of those is to expand the jurisdiction and improve the effectiveness of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The second involves the transfer of various modification orders made by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, briefly known as the commissioner in my later remarks, into the body of the SI(S) Act. Then come the provisions which intend to require audits of the superannuation entities to cover compliance with certain provisions of the SI(S) Act and the regulations and, fourth and last, provision to make other miscellaneous amendments to the SI(S) Act, the S(RC) Act and the SE(T) Act, primarily aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of those acts and the system of prudential supervision of the superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told the financial impact of the bill will result in an increase in outlays of approximately $1 million. The proposed amendments provide for the creation of a deputy chairperson and two part-time members of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. In a full year the cost of these positions is estimated to be about $270,000 of which about $223,000 will be for salary or in the form of salary related costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, we are informed, a resource bill will, as required, be brought forward for consultation with the Department of Finance in the additional estimates progress. The full year costs of this bid are expected to be of the order of $500,000, of which $340,000 would be for salary or for salary related expenditure. Further one-off costs, including a new case management system, would add a further $210,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 42 of schedule 4 of the bill requires trustees to arrange for an auditor to give the trustee a report of the operations of the fund in an approved form. An approved form must include a statement by the auditor that the fund complies with certain provisions of the SI(S) Act and regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A trustee who intentionally or recklessly fails to make the necessary amendments will become liable to a penalty of up to two years imprisonment. An auditor who intentionally or recklessly fails to provide the report by the prescribed time will be liable to a penalty of up to six months imprisonment. Clauses 65 and 66 of schedule 4 of the bill enable the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to disqualify any auditor who fails to adequately and properly perform any of their assigned SIS functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also empower the commissioner to refer a matter to an auditors' professional association for appropriate disciplinary action. I would have thought that, rather than prison terms, that might have been the best way to go. But these amendments aim to ensure that auditors are more likely to do their job properly, I suppose&mdash;and so they should. I would have thought that auditors would be professional enough to meet their obligations and perform audits in a professional manner which meets the requirements of the SI(S) Act without the threat of penalties, including imprisonment. However, this amendment should provide a bit of stick to ensure that auditors do meet their obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 29 of the SI(S) Act empowers the commissioner to grant exemptions from and make modifications of certain provisions of the act and its regulations. This power enables the commissioner to quickly address problems as they arise. The commissioner may issue either a modification declaration or a temporary modification declaration. However, I understand that the latter will have no effect after 30 June 1996. The subject matter of a temporary modification declaration order can only be retained after 30 June 1996 if it is legislated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incorporating these declarations within the act also provides an opportunity for me to comment on the subject matter. For the S(RC) Act, the amendments expand the jurisdiction of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, the SCT, to consider medical evidence if the decision to which the complaint relates was made on or after 1 November 1994. Previously there was a concern that the SCT would be swamped by complex conflicting medical opinion, which would be difficult to resolve. A regulation was drafted to limit the hearing of medical disputes by the SCT, but this was disallowed in the Senate in September last year. It was disallowed, I understand, because it was felt that people with disabilities should have access to a low cost dispute mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government changed its position in October 1994 to allow the SCT to be able to handle medical complaints from 1 May 1995, following consultations with interested parties about possible approaches. However, this matter was thrown into some confusion after the High Court ruled on the Brandy case. The Brandy decision has had only a very minimal impact on the operations of the SCT because, unlike the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the HREOC, the SCT does not have enforcement powers, nor does it set out to usurp judicial powers. It is hard to believe that the powers of the HREOC remained unchallenged for so long. It is very clear that the Boilermakers case of 1956 set a precedent, and led to the splitting of the Arbitration and Conciliation Court into the Arbitration Commission, now the IRC, and the industrial division of the Federal Court, now the Industrial Relations Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court held in its Brandy decision that judicial power is to be only exercised by courts and bodies established and constituted under the constitution. The nub of judicial power is that it involves the determination of existing rights. It is not, however, an exercise of judicial power to create new rights. There is a potential jurisdictional problem with the SCT, so this bill amends section 14(2) of the S(RC) Act to remove `in excess of the powers of the trustee' and `was an improper exercise of the powers of the trustee' as grounds on which a complaint may be made to the SCT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1994, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer indicated that legislation would be expedited to ensure the SCT had jurisdiction to deal with complaints involving life insurance superannuation products. The bill inserts a new subsection 14A(1), which enables a person who has an interest in a life policy fund to complain to the SCT that the decision of the trustee to admit the person to the fund was unfair or unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has the effect of allowing people who have suffered misconduct, such as misrepresentation from life office agents, to obtain redress. The tribunal will be able to hear only such complaints as relate to those who are admitted to a fund on or after the day on which this bill receives the royal assent. Consumers with complaints made prior to that date can access the Life Insurance Complaints Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Life Insurance Federation of Australia has made the valid criticism that this bill provides that only products sold by life insurance companies and their agents are covered by this method of redress. There is no equivalent right to complain to the tribunal where there is misconduct associated with non-life insurance superannuation products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, superannuation unit trusts operated by financial organisations, such as the Bankers Trust, will not be covered by the SCT. Their products are not sold by agents, but are usually sold by independent financial planners of the ilk of the columnist to whom I referred earlier. This effectively means that any amendment to extend coverage of the SCT to other financial organisations will need further, wide ranging amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am led to believe that the government intends, provided an election does not intervene, to introduce amendments next year if it is still in government. It might even go ahead after that election. But, no doubt, come the election of the coalition the ISC will still be proposing the amendments. In any event, these future amendments are most likely to receive bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes amendments to both the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1995, requiring general insurance companies and life offices to comply with determinations of the tribunal. The commissioner will be able to apply to the Federal Court for an injunction where determinations have been flouted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the addition of a deputy chairperson and two part-time members of the tribunal. However, clause 16 amends subsection 8(1) of the S(RC) Act to provide that a person who has reached 65 years of age cannot hold office as the deputy chairperson. That seems to be in breach of what we understand to be the anti-discrimination objectives shared by both sides of the parliament. As far as I am concerned, this age discrimination should be removed from the bill. </PARA>

<PARA>Further she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But one thing worth remembering in all the noise we are likely to hear about superannuation is that the big powers in superannuation now are the industry funds&mdash;established by Labor itself&mdash;rather than the institutions like AMP who simply manage their money.</PARA>
<PARA>Now the Prime Minister is talking about more changes to the system and attacking the very fund managers whom we are supposed to have so much faith in. Many superannuation funds have been poor performers, as we all know. Poor performing fund managers do not deserve their big salary packages. Competition in the industry is essential if the in-built overheads of the large super funds are to be reduced and better returns paid to fund members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should also be brought to account for its use of superannuation as a milch cow to try to plug our structural budget deficit. If the up-front, 15 per cent Labor tax on employers' contributions was reduced or abolished, superannuation accounts would be able to provide something like reasonable retirement benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government needs to seriously evaluate what it wants to do with superannuation because to date Labor's policies in this area have been simply ad hoc. In fact, they please very few people except the union movement whose leaders now get to play with the retirement dollars of hundreds of thousands of Australian workers. Given the events of the past week and the union movement's demonstrated lack of faith in the Hawke-Keating regime, even a Labor government may come to rue the day it gave the power that goes with the control of huge super funds to its former mates among the union bosses. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to participate in the debate on the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, because there have been numerous amendments made by the government to superannuation over a long period of time and it is getting quite irritating for the opposition to have an endless, seemingly unconnected series of decisions made on superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that discretionary savings are falling and savings are being pushed, in a non-discretionary way, into compulsory savings processes is something that many Australians resent. It has brought about a situation wherein the savings and superannuation policy of this government has reduced national savings from 24.1 per cent&mdash;the rate when they came to office&mdash;to 16.3 per cent. They have driven down, in fact, the commitments made to savings by our fellow Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of confidence in markets has been, perhaps, a reason for it. The behaviour of some of our `entrepreneurs' may be another reason. But I suspect that the real reason is a lack of confidence in the whole process of superannuation, and that it is a lack of confidence in Australia's future that is discouraging people from saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further factor. It is the psychological impact of a compulsory superannuation system whereby people are compelled to save or their employers are compelled to save for them. People think that that is enough. They think they have done enough: `Whatever the government requires is enough savings for us. We have got a compulsory process in place and, therefore, we do not have to make any additional effort.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that is the appalling mismanagement of the whole economy that the government has shown. That really has put so much pressure on Australian families that not only do they have less disposable income, but they also have greatly diminished discretionary savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is a combination of the poorly managed economy, uncertainty about jobs and uncertainty about commitments to flexible payouts such as mortgage rates on housing&mdash;where we have seen, over the last two or three years, people suddenly hit for huge increases in their weekly payouts to keep their mortgages covered. It is all of those things: the unexpected rises in mortgage rates, the compulsory savings program of the government through superannuation, the lack of certainty about Australia's future, and the inclination of Australians to not save when there is such strong economic pressure on them and such uncertainty about their own futures and the futures of their family members in regard to employment and employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To look at the underlying factors that have produced this process, one has only to look at the government's inflationary policy, which is very hard to assess and predict. The government's inflationary policy was supposed to retain inflation in the band of two to three per cent. It is over that right now; in real terms it is 3.1 per cent. Underlying inflation has hit 3.1 per cent and the headline rate is now 5.1 per cent. So there is a discouragement, straight away, because the cost of living is going ahead of the pace at which people can keep up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the government has no monetary policies that would encourage a belief that there is going to be a fall in interest rates. In fact, the International Monetary Fund has said to the government, `Do not dare manipulate interest rates down before the next election.' Now, to my knowledge, that is the first time the International Monetary Fund has come in and given a directive to an Australian government. The fund has made the comment that we should not reduce interest rates, artificially or in any other way, before an election unless there are the economic circumstances that will force interest rates down. I think it is a tragedy that we have this international body starting now to intervene in the Australian economy. It is all the work of the Australian Labor Party and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The next step, of course, if there is increased certainty, will be that they will take over the total management of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the uncertainty of the fall in interest rates produced by the government's monetary policy is something that is of deep concern to many Australians. Most Australians do not understand the Labor Party's tax policy. They do not know what they are going to be hit for next because this has been a government of big grabs in taxation. This has been the government that has said, `We are not going to have a goods and services tax,' but which, as soon as it could possibly do it, after the last elections, instigated a widespread, far-reaching wholesale sales tax which bumped up the price of goods and services. It is built into nearly everything. It is built into transport, packaging and the whole box and dice. In fact, food is taxed currently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spread and the change in taxation, and the uncertainty in the taxation policy, are factors that are working against the community's preference to save. There is no micro-economic reform policy that is worth thinking about. It does not affect many people but it does mean that the built in costs and the overheads of day-to-day living are not declining, but increasing. All of these factors, which are built into the government's assessment of the economy, have worked to have the government rely solely on the superannuation industry for its method of creating a savings environment in Australia. It is far too narrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No person in Australia would know more about superannuation policy and savings policy than my colleague the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly).

The fact is that, as we are well aware, the government's processes, its whole policy framework and its whole attitude towards superannuation have proved disastrous for many Australians. Let me reiterate that the massive decline in savings has meant that the government has borrowed overseas, and then, when it was criticised for that, it got more into the Australian market and borrowed more expensive money from Australia, but a smaller amount is available because much of it is no longer saved. The government is forcing up interest rates on the Australian domestic market because of the money that it needs to borrow. Everything that this government does seems to work against its proposals for savings. It goes and sticks taxes on top of something that it is trying to encourage. I think it is the weirdest thing the government has ever done. We are going to have a positive program of encouraging people to save&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague says, it makes the poor poorer, then it goes and taxes them. It forces them to save and then it goes and taxes them for saving. There are itinerant fruit pickers and some other itinerant workers&mdash;TAFE teachers are a classic&mdash;working for short periods at different times through the week or through the year, depending on the course. Compulsory savings are going out of their super. You do not know what to do because those small amounts decline by the imposition of taxation and charges made by superannuation funds. Eventually, of course, the people involved notionally finish up owing the superannuation funds money for looking after their accounts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the member for Bradfield has got some great processes to overcome that. He has enunciated them. I just happen to have in front of me a speech made by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), in which he talks about the processes that can be used for these small amounts, particularly for women who may have an intermittent work history. He talks about retirement savings accounts. I think it is a real innovation and is something that Australians will welcome, where they can add into the same account successive amounts. In contrast with the current system, the money does not have to be directed into a multiplicity of funds all over the countryside so that when a person finishes their working life, maybe after 40 years work, they cannot even remember who was responsible for deducting their first compulsory superannuation. They do not know what fund they stuck that into. They can hardly remember what job they were doing at the time. You have got these scattered funds being used up by superannuation funds all over the country, of no benefit to anybody and certainly not meeting the government's objectives as far as retirement is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got this alternative and it is going to be something that I think is going to warm the hearts of many Australians. It is sensible, it is modest, it gives them an advantage and it allows them to set funds aside over a long period of time for their retirement. It is something like a bank account rather than a superannuation fund in the strict sense, but the concessions are there and the opportunities are there. It is going to provide incentive for people to save, unlike what the government is doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No way. The disgusting idea of thinking those people in the Australian Taxation Office are suddenly going to turn themselves into beneficent investors on behalf of their clients! I have never heard anything so ridiculous. Most people that I know, especially in the small business community around western Sydney, generally have a good relationship with the tax office, but occasionally there are problems. I do not think there is any more disliked group in our community than tax officers applying the rigours of the law over-enthusiastically. That is the image that the Australian community tends to have of people in the Australian Taxation Office, as people who are rigorous in the application of the law, people who are relentless in pursuing the government's dollars, people who have a charge direct from the Prime Minister to rip out of the community every dollar that they can possibly get.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To think of that group of people as being kindly disposed towards savers, kindly disposed towards understanding the money markets and investment and kindly disposed towards the ultimate retirement of people is absolutely unlikely, because it is the government's own proposal that on retirement you are taxing the superannuation funds. That never used to happen but you are doing it. I am not saying that we are going to remove it&mdash;you are so far down the track into taxing things that it is very difficult for an incoming government to make too many changes to unscramble the massive grab for money that you guys have gone into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken in general terms on superannuation but I would just like to spend a little time covering the specific legislation. The superannuation industry has expressed its comments about the jurisdiction to hear superannuation complaints involving all intermediaries, including life brokers and their representatives and security dealers and their proper authority holders. The industry recognises that there need to be some changes to supervision processes, but we understand that there is no clear-cut view. I think the attitude here is that nobody likes increased rigour in supervision but, if there is a reasonable argument, let us try it. But the government needs to be flexible enough to wind back the supervisory processes if they are too onerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purposes of this legislation are to expand the jurisdiction and improve the effectiveness of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. I guess that is reasonable in that there are a lot of complaints about the performance of funds, and I understand that. But with increased flexibility in retirement packages being offered and a greater range of opportunity for retirement savings, I think some of these complaints will vanish as people start to select the type of retirement package that best suits their circumstances, whether they be male or female, full-time or part-time worker, salary or wage earner. The government has failed to do that because it has a prescriptive approach. It is the coalition's view that, provided people are saving for their retirement,  as we offer more flexibility the complaints that we currently see against funds will tend to diminish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other purposes of this legislation are the transferring of various modification orders made by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner into the body of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, requiring audits of superannuation entities to cover compliance with certain provisions of the act, and the making of other miscellaneous amendments primarily aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of superannuation legislation and the system of prudential supervision of the superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that we need greater supervision, let me make a few comments about the Prime Minister because I think he provides a very suitable place to finish my comments on superannuation. Here is the member of parliament who is the first among all ministers and the person who did the deal on superannuation. Here is the man who went into the tax summit saying that there would be no tax on superannuation and came out with a tax on superannuation. Here is the man who said that we must have a savings regime for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is the man who did the deal with the superannuation funds and gained the support of those great financial institutions, election after election, as they promised and could see additional money flowing into their coffers. Not one of these great institutions was critical, or has ever been critical, of something the government has done. They have played the government's game very effectively because they have seen, and have been encouraged to believe, that there will be an increasing flow of funds into their coffers and they will have an enhanced opportunity to invest in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is the Prime Minister who engineered, encouraged and devised this program. And this same Prime Minister who has charged those very people with the responsibility of looking after the funds of all of the workers in Australia&mdash;whether they be in the building, metal trades or any trade union driven superannuation fund, or in the larger, more amorphous funds&mdash;is now saying to every member of those funds, `You have got donkeys looking after your investment.'</PARA>

But, by the way, the people who are managing those funds are donkeys.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often interesting that people, from time to time, when talking about retirement income policies, turn to what is happening in Singapore with the Central Provident Fund, where quite large percentages of income are placed in a superannuation type fund. For contributions for workers up to 55 years, it is 40 per cent&mdash;20 per cent contributed by the employee and 20 per cent by the employer. This is a large pool of money. As one of the aims of the fund they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government helps by exempting CPF earnings from tax and guaranteeing payment of CPF savings. We&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the CPF&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on our part will, where we can, make our assets and services available to help meet Singapore's social and economic objectives, thereby improving the quality of life of all Singaporeans and CPF Members.</PARA>
<PARA>If we are going to have criticism of what the funds are doing with their investments, it has got to be seen that it is in that context. It is in a context that we now have these pools of investment greatly developing in size and that it is quite right for the community and the government to enter into a discussion about how we might best place those funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In question time today there was a reference to a speech made by Minister Sciacca yesterday, perhaps again attempting to misconstrue slightly the way in which he put his comments about the potential that can be achieved with appropriate investment. I would just like to refer to his speech. He was talking to trustees about the bill that this piece of legislation amends, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act is there to protect you&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the trustees&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the savings of working Australians from outside influences which could comprise the direction of your financial investments.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This includes the government of the day. Despite the odd rumour that gets legs, this government has no intention of directing investments.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having said that, all of us in government experience the frustration of seeing the dollar value of super funds build up as a direct result of government policy, yet see example upon example of young Australian companies and Australian ideas going offshore because long term venture capital is difficult to attract domestically.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in his speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have to develop a better understanding of emerging small and medium sized enterprises. Some will be too risky but we should judge them through knowledge of their operation, not ignorance.</PARA>
<PARA>Further&mdash;this was perhaps what was perceived to be the most controversial&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Likewise established Australian firms have an obligation, in my view, as offshore loans are being renegotiated from time to time, to package those loans in such a way as to make it financially attractive for domestic super funds to purchase that debt and keep the interest payments in Australia rather than going to Asia, Europe or the Americas.</PARA>
<PARA>So who was his message for? His message was for those Australian firms when renegotiating offshore loans. That seems a very laudatory comment to be made as a contribution to a very important debate. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we do our job well, creatively, boldly, while still protecting the accruing retirement income of working Australians, then I am sure this will occur. There is little point of creating a new national savings pool if in the end it simply means we add wealth to our competitors overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the real problems is that, when we have the debates and there is some form of suggestion that we might be trying to influence, indicate, `direct' the way in which superannuation fund managers look at their investments, it is thought, `Here we go, it is capital "I" intervention.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will admit that I do not shy away from saying that government should intervene where appropriate. I am quite happy to be labelled an interventionist. It continually saddens me that, when we talk about whether governments should get involved in investment schemes, from time to time the performance of the Victorian state government is raised in connection with this debate. If it is&mdash;to use the example of some of the things that occurred in the time of the VEDC in Victoria&mdash;that we are then to scuttle what is basically a good idea, I reject that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were many things that happened during that era in Victoria that should not have happened, but there were many great successes. Some of those successes include organisations such as AMRAD. With the number of medical institutions and Victorian universities that were involved in biotechnology, the Victorian Labor government of the time wondered why it was that, when any of these ideas were to be developed, such institutes had to go offshore. So it decided to set up a mechanism to ensure that those things could be developed onshore for the benefit of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that it is a problem to grab desperately at one good example when people trot out a whole host of bad examples. But the problem in Victoria was that decisions about appropriate investments were made without the context of appropriate industry policies. I admit that one of the first cornerstones that we have to see, before we try to influence the way in which managers make their investment decisions by giving them alternatives and procedures that will enable them to go forward into those areas that I have spoken about, is that this should happen in the context of proper industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another unfashionable thing to do in debate is to refer to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia reconstructed</EMPHASIS>, a tripartite report of several years ago and one of the many reports that from time to time end up gathering a great deal of dust on the bookshelf. Because it took the Scandinavian model, it is pooh-poohed around the place at the moment, but it still has a great deal of relevance and is something which Australia might revisit and have a look at. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia reconstructed</EMPHASIS> talked about national development funds and about portions of the developing superannuation funds perhaps being directed towards such a fund. Its recommendation No. 1.5 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increased investment must therefore be `led' and industry policy is a principal vehicle for `leading' investment. Governments should not only deliver the correct macroeconomic environment, but also complement this with an aggressive and comprehensive (sectoral-specific) trade and industry development strategy, a network of `active' labour market and training programs and a set of comprehensive supporting policies.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a suggestion that should be revisited, so that we can open up different options for the trustees. In his second reading speech earlier today, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In many cases, trustees retain fund managers to invest superannuation money. The government considers that fund managers need to find ways to invest in a broader range of businesses, rather than concentrating their equity investments on blue-chip stocks. For example, fund managers should consider placing a portion of their investments in small, innovative businesses. This will potentially yield better returns for investors, as well as contributing to the economic wellbeing of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>I reject the basis of the second reading amendment. I welcome the fact that the Prime Minister has engendered a bit of debate about this matter and I welcome the comments that Minister Sciacca made yesterday and the comments that the parliamentary secretary has made in his second reading speech. Obviously, speaking just as a backbencher of the government party, I wish we were going further. I do not mind doing that. We have the potential to be small `i' interventionist in a whole host of ways that will contribute to the overall economic and social wellbeing of Australia as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I flagged that I wished to raise concerns some of the real problems that we might have with inequity of the present system. I refer to a paper by Alison McClelland and Peter Davidson from the Brotherhood of St Laurence who have raised a number of the matters that I have had some concern with over a long time. I think that these are things that, as we continue to develop our superannuation policy, we should keep having a look at so that we can best direct a successful superannuation system over time. In their paper, they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The combined impact of tax assistance for superannuation and the proposed new government contribution is to exacerbate rather than reduce their inequities.</PARA>
<PARA>They indicate that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there can be little doubt that the compulsory superannuation, at the point of contribution, will have a greater adverse impact on the disposable incomes of low income earners than on those earning above average incomes. Low income earners are much less likely to be saving through superannuation already and  much more likely to need all their income for current expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst I do not totally share their doom and gloom, because I think that at some stage you have got to break into the system and make a conscious decision, I recognise that these are problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken also in the past about the way we deal with the taxation of contributions&mdash;that it does give higher income earners a greater deal of benefit than it does at the lower end. As I said, I support the compulsory superannuation scheme because it has given greater access to superannuation to lower income earners and it is an entree into the system. But as the amounts of money that are being put into the funds on behalf of individuals become greater, perhaps we will have to look at some of the options that are displayed in some of the overseas schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in his speech to the trustees, Minister Sciacca went to the notion that is being revisited by the coalition that perhaps we could open up some of the individuals' superannuation funds to be used for housing deposits. As Minister Sciacca said, this is something that the government had a look at and has decided not to proceed with. He quite rightly indicated in his speech that&mdash;if you use the example of Singapore again&mdash;because there is a combined 40 per cent contribution between the employer and employee in Singapore it allows workers to draw on super for housing deposits, education, top-up parental retirement incomes and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst rejecting them at this stage on the basis, as the minister has put it, that we are really talking about chalk and cheese in the size of the funds, these are something that McClelland and Davidson have talked about in their paper and described as `life cycle' savings. Now that has some element of the Singapore scheme in that there is a guaranteed part of their provident fund pool that is set aside most definitely for the retirement income aspects, but there are other parts of the pool that allow use of the funds by the individuals and the families for housing, for the education of their children, for topping up their parents' retirement income and for investing in other forms of investment&mdash;some forms of shares, et cetera&mdash;to top up their potential retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be, as our superannuation scheme develops, and as we have large amounts being set aside for individuals, that we recognise that there are differing pressures on families at different stages of the families' development and that we could, as the amounts of money involved get larger, in a sense, be able to give alternatives for the families. As has been said often, we are talking at the moment about very small amounts. To toy with giving these choices that would allow the families to move these small amounts in and out would not mean that the totality of the overall funds would not continue to grow and continue to be of a size such that we can make worthy investments on a national scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I do not wish to be misconstrued, because the present compulsory superannuation scheme of this government has my full support.

That will spell out what we are doing. You might learn something if you get a copy; we will send you a copy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the complaints about the super tribunal and its jurisdiction. Some members have raised the question of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal's jurisdiction over sales of non-life public offer super products.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On superannuation policy generally, we note that the opposition, of course, has done an about-face on superannuation. It was the worst thing in the world when we brought it in. When we raised it to 15 per cent, you would have thought the sky had fallen in. But now, all of a sudden, it is their policy too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with the FBT, capital gains tax and Medicare&mdash;everything we have brought in&mdash;it is a case of `Me too!'

There is the Labor government, which has been setting up these superannuation policies and schemes to boost retirement incomes and look after national savings, and the coalition, which just says, `Me too!' but in the past has never done anything other than give a tax break to the wealthy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition opposed the passage of the principal act, arguing that it discriminated against projects with a capital cost of less than $50 million, would not be available for investment in plant and equipment in all areas of the economy and did not apply to projects which commenced prior to 31 December 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This principal act has been amended several times since its passage in 1992. In 1992, it was amended to allow applicants for the allowance to elect to aggregate two or more joint venture projects for specified projects and to allow long-term leased equipment within the tests for eligibility. In 1993, it was amended to extend the allowance to certain projects in the motor vehicle and print media industries, to honour the government's commitment made during the 1993 election campaign. It was amended again in 1994, to extend the allowance to property for use in the transport of minerals and quarry materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed that projects representing some $67.7 billion have already been registered for the allowance. In Western Australia, projects totalling $26 1/2 billion have been registered for the allowance, $15 billion in the mining sector. As the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) pointed out, this bill amends the principal act to remove some restrictions on the restructuring of projects eligible for the development allowance so that a more consistent approach is available to the various types of prospective applicants for the allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes were announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on 13 July 1995, in his words `to provide greater scope for restructuring of projects while retaining eligibility for the development allowance'. The Treasurer estimated that the amendments would boost investment figures further, allowing additional projects of at least $1.8 billion to be eligible for the allowance.

A result of the amendments is that any applications for registration of plant expenditure that were refused or granted in respect of an amount of expenditure that was less than the amount of expenditure whose registration was sought in the application may be granted in full if the amendments had been in force when the principal act received royal assent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to the debate on the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1995, because just last week BHP, which operates the Port Kembla steelworks in my electorate of Throsby, had its new No. 6 blast furnace approved for the development allowance. This project is worth in excess of $400 million, so the bill before the House this evening has particular timely relevance for me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 so as to allow certain projects to be restructured to be eligible for the development allowance. The amendments also have a retrospective element allowing them to operate as from 1 January 1993. The amendments will remove certain restrictions on access to the development allowance in terms of the ownership of the project. At the present time, the benefit of the development allowance cannot be transferred in some cases where ownership of a project is also transferred following a commercial restructure. In other words, a single owner could not transfer the project to a joint venture or a joint venture could not transfer the project to a single owner and still be eligible for the development allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, after being approached by various industry groups that argued that this measure was causing difficulties because, for commercial and technical reasons, it might be necessary to restructure a project during its development stage, commissioned a review by the Development Allowance Authority, the Australian Taxation Office and the Treasury, and the results are to amend the legislation to provide more scope for the restructure of a project during development and its still being eligible for the development allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the government's goals has always been to strengthen business investment so that we could underpin strong but sustainable economic growth. In 1994-95 business investment grew by an outstanding 16 per cent. Business investment has been at this level because interest rates have fallen and there is a downward pressure on them. Inflation is at historically low levels, below five per cent for almost four years, and will remain low. Company profits are at an all-time high and continue to grow strongly. Business confidence has also picked up and remains high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also make the point, notwithstanding the events with the CRA dispute over the last days, that cooperative industrial relations has contributed significantly to the increase of business investment in Australia. Business investment is also growing strongly because the taxation system encouraged productive investment. The government has established considerable taxation concessions for business which include accelerated depreciation, the general investment allowance, this development allowance, infrastructure bonds, and research and development concessions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth mentioning that the government has reduced the rate of company taxation to 36 per cent, which is significantly lower than when the opposition occupied the Treasury bench. Together, all of the taxation concessions I have mentioned will provide business in Australia with a benefit of approximately $3 billion in 1995-96. The cost of these amendments alone will be $10 million per year and the total cost over the nine years from 1993-94 to 2001-02 is expected to be about $92 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the introduction of a development allowance in the One Nation statement on 26 February 1992. The development allowance provides for a taxation deduction of 10 per cent of the capital expenditure incurred on the acquisition or lease of new plant or equipment for projects with capital expenditure of $50 million or more. I know that there has been some discussion about whether it should have been lower than $50 million or not, but that is the figure that they have settled on. The introduction of the development allowance encouraged investment in large projects, stimulated micro-economic reform and encouraged international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act established a Development Allowance Authority which is a one-member statutory authority which determines the eligibility of projects for the development allowance. I understand that well over 500 applications were received to be granted a development allowance involving capital expenditure of well over $100 billion. So far, 270 of these projects, involving some $75 billion in capital expenditure, have been registered. Of these, 31 projects have been approved, involving expenditure of over $6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of these projects approved for the development allowance, as I mentioned earlier, was BHP for its No. 6 blast furnace at the Port Kembla steelworks. This is the first BHP project to fulfil the requirements of the Development Allowance Authority's `competitiveness test'. The No. 6 blast furnace is an over-$400 million project which involved more than 3,000 people, mostly from the Illawarra, to work at various times throughout the construction phases of the project. The current peak construction work force is approximately 900 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the No. 6 blast furnace is commissioned in March next year, the two smaller existing furnaces, No. 4 and No. 2, will be decommissioned. The result will be increased efficiency and increased capacity which is required in the supply of steel to export markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The new No. 6 blast furnace will lead the world in metal quality, productivity and environmental controls. High levels of automation and mechanical aids will significantly improve working conditions, increase efficiency and safety, and minimise repetitive intensive workloads. I am also pleased that the No. 6 blast furnace is aiming at achieving zero accidents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one area that really needs to be carefully examined in workplaces it is safety, accidents and injury. The New South Wales government is again revisiting the issue of workers compensation and there are a few unsavoury points which I view with concern. But the real message is that, rather than attack workers compensation entitlements, workplaces need to be made safer places for workers. It is therefore disappointing that the New South Wales government has appointed former Premier Barry Unsworth to the New South Wales Work Cover Authority to oversee various proposals for change which, if one relies on media reports, will again attack workers compensation entitlements&mdash;as he did in 1988. My union colleagues have expressed concern to me that, given the former Premier's inability to listen to arguments on this issue in 1988, he will go much further this time in his new position. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The BHP Port Kembla steelworks group general manager, Paul Jeans, has agreed with my expectation and committed BHP to projects in the Illawarra totalling more than $1 billion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention the contribution of the Illawarra's combined trade unions and BHP's work force.

The Illawarra has always been portrayed as a union town. It is a union town and it will always be one.

<PARA>This bill will make changes to the youth training allowance provisions of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. Late last year these provisions were incorporated into part 8 of the act and modelled on those for jobsearch allowance found in the Social Security Act 1991. As the youth training allowance and jobsearch allowance are closely aligned, it is important that any changes to one are mirrored in the other and  commence at or about the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The youth training allowance is just one part of the youth training initiative. To those leaving school early, the youth training initiative offers more than an income support payment. It offers case management, training and jobs. Young people who leave school at the end of this school year can be eligible for this assistance, not six months or a year down the track but at the same time as their former classmates are beginning a new year of school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people now realise that if they want to have a good, well paid job they need to stay on at school, look for an apprenticeship or a traineeship, or pursue further vocational training. Jobs that are full time, well paid and stable increasingly require education, training and skills. If we are to help early school leavers who are unemployed, we need to give them the training and skills that will open the doors to full-time quality jobs. That is what the youth training initiative aims to do and that is why we pay 15- to 17-year-olds youth training allowance rather than jobsearch allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several of the amendments that are proposed in this bill will contribute directly to the main aim of the youth training initiative&mdash;improving the job prospects of early school leavers. The remaining amendments will foster efficient administration of the youth training allowance by keeping it aligned with the common provisions of the Social Security Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in schedule 1 close a minor loophole in the calculation of youth training allowance for those who receive a periodic compensation payment paid as a lump sum. The treatment of compensation payments to a couple where one member of the couple receives youth training allowance and the other a benefit under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 is also amended to ensure consistency across Commonwealth income support measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in schedule 2 have two objectives. The first is to allow 15-year-olds who are assessed as `independent' to qualify for YTA immediately, even if they do not meet the work force requirements. Currently these people can only be paid special benefit. The second objective is to allow 15-year-olds who have a work force history, and who live with parents who are in receipt of Commonwealth income support, to qualify immediately for youth training allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in schedule 3 will allow youth training allowance overpayments to be offset against any student assistance payments, such as Austudy, which a person may subsequently be entitled to receive.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 5 enhances the provisions dealing with the waiver and recoverability of debts. The amendments will permit partial waiver of a debt in certain circumstances, as well as clarifying when it is more cost effective to waive some smaller debts. The amendments will allow for more flexible negotiated settlements to avoid unnecessary and costly administrative appeals. They also give a mechanism for considering an up-front part-payment to quit a debt based on commercial considerations. The amendments will permit the non-recovery of a debt where there are special circumstances that make recovery inequitable. Furthermore, the amendments will allow debts subject to Administrative Appeals Tribunal proceedings to be settled in the same manner as an `out of court' settlement of a matter before a civil court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 6 makes some minor clarifications regarding the time a client has to nominate a bank account once approval of youth training allowance is made, and what allowance might be back-paid if the client does not nominate an account within a prescribed time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will make changes to the youth training allowance provisions of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 that are found in part 8 of the act. These were incorporated into the Student and Youth Assistance Act late last year and modelled on the jobsearch allowance provisions contained in the Social Security Act 1991. As the youth training allowance and jobsearch allowance are closely aligned it is important that any changes to one are mirrored in the other, and commence at or about the same time. These amendments follow amendments proposed to the Social Security Act 1991 by the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The youth training allowance is just one part of the youth training initiative. To early school leavers this initiative offers more than just an income support payment; it offers case management, training and jobs. Case management at 13 weeks makes sure that early school leavers are not lost in the crowd. A young person's case manager works with them individually to map a pathway out of unemployment. Case managers can immediately offer a wide range of training, education and work experience options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early access to training, education and work experience opportunities is vital for early school leavers. Young people who enter the labour market without post-secondary qualifications or work experience find it difficult to get full-time permanent jobs. Skills, qualifications and experience are more important now than at any time in the past. The youth training initiative offers a way out of the no job, no experience, no qualifications trap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This initiative is an active response to youth unemployment. Income support should not aim to treat the symptoms of unemployment; it should work to tackle the causes. This bill will make sure that the income support component of the youth training initiative, the youth training allowance, operates smoothly as part of an integrated package of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in schedule 1 mirror amendments proposed to the Social Security Act 1991. They are intended primarily to ensure the consistency of Commonwealth income support measures and prevent anomalies arising between income support payments. These amendments simplify the rules applying to financial investments. At present there are many different and complex rules for calculating the income from financial investments. These amendments will mean that those rules will no longer apply and financial investments will be assessed under one set of simple rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment in schedule 2 will provide for unemployed clients who are temporarily unable to work because of illness or injury to remain in receipt of youth training allowance, instead of being required to transfer to sickness allowance. By remaining on youth training allowance they will continue to access eligibility for the full range of assistance available to the unemployed. This access will encourage them to pursue education or training activities as they recover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in schedule 3 make changes to the earnings credit scheme. This scheme operates to provide an incentive for a person to undertake part-time or casual employment. When the ordinary income test is applied for the purposes of calculating a person's fortnightly rate of a benefit, short periods of remunerative work could have the effect of reducing the person's rate of benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, recipients of youth training allowance can accrue an earnings credit from which they can offset earnings for remunerative work before the income test is applied. A person may offset an amount of earnings up to the person's earnings credit balance, which is a maximum of $500. Earnings credits are not accessible if the person's fortnightly rate of ordinary income exceeds an amount that reduces the rate of the person's assistance to nil. The proposed amendments will allow a person to access earnings credit notwithstanding that the person's ordinary income amount would, if the income test were applied, reduce the rate of the assistance to nil. Further adjustments to the application of earnings credits are also made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the first thing that needs to be said about this piece of legislation is that it is yet another bill which has had to be introduced into the parliament because of the decision by the government to take over the youth training allowance or to invent a new payment, the youth training allowance, which substitutes for jobsearch in relation to young people and to assume control over this allowance from the Department of Social Security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this has never been adequately explained. The necessity for it has never been adequately justified. Consequently, a great deal of new legislation is required simply to mirror provisions in social security legislation. In other words, the parliament is being put to a great deal of extra work solely to gratify, apparently, the imperial ambitions of the Department of Employment, Education and Training to have under its control the payment of a significant allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that should be said about this legislation is that, as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has pointed out, it is part of the government's youth training initiative. The whole purpose of the measures for youth in the white paper Working Nation as set out by the government, was to assist unemployed youth get back into employment and particularly to assist long-term unemployed youth to get back into employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia will be asking at this stage, almost 17 months since the commencement of the Working Nation program, whether this youth training initiative has been effective. They will be asking, `What is now the position of young people in Australia as a result of the measures brought down by the government?' The answer is a very sorry answer indeed. Any reference to the official statistics will reveal the fact that youth unemployment in Australia is now higher than it was when Working Nation commenced operation. Not only has the youth training initiative failed to bring down unemployment amongst young people but teenage unemployment has actually increased since Working Nation began. The very age group which is the recipient of the youth training allowance and the supposed beneficiary of the youth training initiative is in more dire straits now than it was when Working Nation commenced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an incredible failure on the part of the government and it needs to be brought firmly into the public limelight because there is no doubt that youth unemployment is one of the most serious social and economic problems which Australia faces today. It has not escaped the attention even of certain media proprietors that this has become a major area of failure by the government. People will want to know why it is that Working Nation has failed young Australians so comprehensively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, of course, does not want people to focus on this issue at all. It will be a matter of continuing shame that the minister has directed his department to cease the publication of the regional youth unemployment statistics, which were readily available to all members of parliament until the last publication&mdash;and then the chopper came down. We are getting too close to an election, Mr Deputy Speaker, for these statistics to be allowed to continue to come out in the public domain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noticed in the departmental publications the somewhat disingenuous statement that the decision to halt the publication of these statistics on youth unemployment was a departmental decision. I can just imagine the officers of this department saying to the minister, `Minister, we have decided to cease the publication of these regional youth unemployment statistics,' and the minister putting up a tremendous fight to keep these statistics in the public domain only to be overruled by Derek Volker and his minions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It stretches credibility too far to imagine that this was a decision taken by the department to the surprise and horror of the minister. Oh, no! We all know that the reality is that the minister was only too eager to halt the publication of these statistics. He came very close to misleading the parliament when a question was asked of him in question time. He said, `Oh, these statistics are still available. All you have to do is to go over to the Bureau of Statistics and they will draw them out for you.' So much for open access to information&mdash;vital information&mdash;about the state of Australian society today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a government whose programs have failed and which has tried to suppress information which might give clear evidence of the extent of that failure and the large number of areas of regional Australia suffering rates of youth unemployment of over 50 per cent. The national rate of youth unemployment&mdash;that is, unemployment amongst teenagers looking for full-time work, which is the commonly accepted measure of youth unemployment&mdash;is 29 per cent. But the figures that were released before the chopper came down, before the censorship was imposed, showed that in a number of areas of regional Australia youth unemployment was well over 50 per cent. In some places, such as in inner and western Melbourne, it was over 60 per cent. And the total unemployment rate in these areas&mdash;the overall unemployment rate&mdash;was over 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can hardly refrain from saying that these areas where unemployment is so high are areas which have been represented for a long time typically by the Labor Party. If you travel to these areas and see the social desolation that the policies of this government has caused with these incredible unemployment rates, with young people clustered around the pinball parlours or in the foyers of overcrowded magistrates courts, you cannot help asking yourself how it is that this party has failed its constituency so comprehensively. What have the members been doing over more than a decade in power? What have they been doing over the last 13 years when they have been in government? Where are the great efforts they have been making to bring industry and jobs to these areas, to their constituents? Where are the policies that will encourage small business in these areas to employ people? Where are the effective regional employment programs that might have a chance of alleviating this appalling scene? They are not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do these Labor members say when they go back to their constituents? They say, `Watch out for the coalition because they will take away your welfare benefits. We have put you all on welfare, sure. But that is even better than a coalition government could do.' They mislead their constituents remorselessly. Indeed, you can see why so many Australians have become cynical about politics and about the Labor Party, and why they say, `Well, really, the Labor Party is the party of poverty.' It is because the Labor Party's principal electoral tactic is to first of all push their constituents into poverty and then frighten them that they will lose their benefits if they change government&mdash;if they change to a government which has a magnificent historical record of creating employment right across the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party ought to hang its head in shame at the situation which its policies have created. They go out to the Australian people and tell them, `Yes, but look at the great things we have done. The youth training initiative, the youth training allowance, the traineeship scheme, the entry level training places. Look at these wonderful initiatives. We are actually helping young people.' Let us forget the fact that youth unemployment has actually gone up, and let us look at these schemes that the government has introduced&mdash;the schemes that they say are going to help young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that many, many thousands of these unemployed young Australians would give their right arm to have an apprenticeship or a traineeship that will lead them into employment. They would love to have that opportunity. I was at a dinner only a couple of weeks ago, put on by the council of the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association. The chairman of that association told the guests at the dinner that his company had recently advertised some 30 apprenticeship vacancies. They got over 900 applications for these 30 apprenticeships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at these opportunities, it is obvious that there are not nearly enough opportunities for young people who want them. Indeed if we look at the statistics and ask what has been the record of this government over 13 years, we find that the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force is the lowest for three decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training and doubtless the minister at the table, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), go around Australia saying `Look at the increasing numbers we have got in traineeships and apprenticeships. Look at the increases in commencements.' What they do not tell you&mdash;and this is just a simple matter of statistical propriety&mdash;is that we have to look at these figures in the context of the size of the work force. Of course, the number has gone up! The work force has increased; the population is growing. There are probably a hundred times the number in traineeships than there were in apprenticeships back in the 1920s&mdash;but what does that mean? As a proportion of the work force, the number of opportunities is the lowest for three decades. That is what matters to those young people who are clamouring for these opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says, `You know that we have given a tremendous emphasis to training over the last 13 years. No government has thought more about training.' We go back to the origins of the Australian traineeship system in 1985, when there were big ambitions to add to the apprenticeships available. It was intended to have an enormous number of new traineeships. Indeed the target at the time was 75,000 commencements in traineeships a year. What happened? The figure never got above 15,000. Mostly, it did not get above 9,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the wonderful traineeship target of Working Nation&mdash;this beacon of hope to young Australians! It had a target of 26,500 traineeships in its first year. This was 10 years after the commencement of the Australian traineeship system. What did they achieve? How many traineeships actually came through, out of this incredibly generous total of 26,500? They managed 16,000 in the first year. What a pathetic performance! This Working Nation, which is supposed to be lifting young Australians up and giving them hope and opportunity, was barely able to get over half its very low target in the first year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no guarantee at all that it will reach its target in the second year. Its target, of course, is based on commencements. Does the government ever tell you that 50 per cent of the commencements drop out? They do not stay. How can we wonder at the fact that the number of young people going for apprenticeships and traineeships is so low and that Australian industry is crying out for skills that are not coming through?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Go around this country, as I am sure the minister does and as I do, and talk to small businesses and chambers of commerce and ask them why they are not taking on apprentices and trainees. The answer comes through, loud and clear: the government's scheme is so complex, so difficult to understand and so embedded in the industrial relations system. This last has been the great problem with it, and the real reason is that, for the last 13 years, there has not genuinely been an agenda to create training opportunities for young Australians. There has been an agenda to make sure that whatever training opportunities are created do not interfere with the centralised award system so beloved of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training has been appendix X to the industrial relations policy of the government. The whole focus, the whole priority, has been on attempting to preserve the positions of privilege of the government's trade union bosses&mdash;its mates, the people who have governed the country alongside the government for 13 years. It has been designed to preserve their position, and young Australians have been betrayed for, and sacrificed to, the preservation of those interests. That is why the performance has been so pathetic. There has not been a training agenda for the past 13 years which has had young people as its principal focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gulf between reality and rhetoric has been colossal under this government. It is no wonder that we find youth unemployment so high. There is a very significant proportion&mdash;not a majority, but a significant proportion&mdash;of young people, perhaps 25 per cent of the senior secondary group and of 19-year-olds, who want workplace based training and who do not intend to go on through TAFE or university. Of course, during most of the 1980s, they had some other options. They had the option of attending a college of advanced education, with vocationally oriented courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recently as 1988, seven years ago, the government&mdash;in the person of John Dawkins&mdash;was out destroying the colleges of advanced education as vocational institutions, yet now, of course, that is the very thing we need. But then they were not the slightest bit interested in TAFE or the colleges of advanced education, or in vocational education. No! Everyone had to go on to universities. Why did the government adopt that policy? Was that their deep and abiding concern for young Australians? Of course not. The reason they adopted the policy of destroying those vocationally oriented institutions was because the unions wanted to have the same employment conditions and the same salary conditions as university staff had. The whole tertiary education and training system was up-ended again to suit the interests of the government's mates in the unions, and young people once again were sacrificed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we see this legislation coming into the parliament, one bill after another concerned with the youth training allowance, putting the legislation for DEET on all-fours with the social security legislation, and when we hear the government telling us time after time how much of an effort it is making for young people, I am sure that the young people of this country see only too clearly what their real situation is. They are a generation which has been more disadvantaged than the generation of almost any other Western country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has the second lowest proportion of senior secondary students in vocational education and training of any industrialised country. It is for this reason that the coalition will be moving an amendment to this bill, a second reading amendment, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the failure of the Government's measures to assist young unemployed people".</PARA>
<PARA>That expresses our view very succinctly. We are not going to be fooled by the rhetoric that comes out of the government and by the bureaucratic manoeuvres that it undertakes. We look very clearly, and the young people of Australia look very clearly, at the performance and the reality. They see the fraud, the misjudgments and the incompetence involved in Working Nation, some of which have already been admitted, not openly but by new decisions recently announced by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most destructive things that Working Nation did in its first year of implementation was to require young people just out of school and looking for jobs to wait around for 12 months until they were long-term unemployed before they qualified for assistance under Working Nation. Working Nation promised that 189,000 of them, mainly young people, would get subsidised employment assistance through the jobstart program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did it achieve? It undershot that target by 94,000. Why did it do that? Not for the reasons the minister gives in explaining that incredible bungle&mdash;that employers prefer employees who have been through the training programs. It is plausible. The only problem was that the training programs he is referring to have lower employment outcomes than the jobstart program. If employers prefer it, why are the employment outcomes lower? That is not the reason. The reason is that there was an extraordinary bungle and they choked off the program that had the most employment outcomes. That was the best guarantee of getting a job, and 94,000 unemployed young people suffered as a result of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation told them, `Wait around. When you are long-term unemployed you will fit within our strategy.' Of course, we all know how destructive it is for highly motivated young people to be asked to sit around doing nothing, going to the pinball parlour, getting into trouble for 12 months. The problem and the difficulty of helping them is so much greater after 12 months than it was when they were highly motivated and first entering the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the government has now changed the entry requirement, the guideline for the subsidised employment programs. There was no fanfare, no acknowledgment to the opposition that it was right 12 months ago, no apology to Australia's young people and no admission of culpability on behalf of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. He knew this a year before he changed the entry guidelines into the program and did nothing because, like Carmen Lawrence, I suppose, he was too proud to ever admit a mistake. It has just got him into trouble because, as the government approaches the election, unemployment is rising again, and long-term unemployment is rising again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Working Nation was about anything it was about helping the long-term unemployed. If the minister had listened to the constructive comments of the coalition well over a year ago then none of this need have happened. If he had listened then so many more thousands of unemployed Australians and unemployed young people could have been effectively helped, but they were not. So do not give us the cant, minister, that the government, by introducing this legislation, is somehow or other helping young Australians. You have not effectively offered any help to young people, because the problem is getting worse, growth is slowing and jobs are scarcer under your policies. Putting your constituents on welfare and frightening them with the claim that a change of government is going to make their position even worse is surely the ultimate abrogation of your responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can you claim any standing when that is the way in which you communicate with the electorate? It is time you got your act together and looked at policies that created the real jobs that young people are looking for. Instead of backing strikes in the way that you do to ensure your electoral support from the ACTU and its senior officials in the coming election campaign and instead of kowtowing constantly under the terms of the accord, you should give some attention to the needs of small business to employ people. You should offer traineeships and apprenticeships to young people and really set about boosting their opportunities. If you did that then you might have some credibility, but at the moment you have none. </PARA>
