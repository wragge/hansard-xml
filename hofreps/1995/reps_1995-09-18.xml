<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the House last met when the question of the application of the sub judice convention to proceedings in the so-called Easton royal commission in Western Australia became an issue, there has been a significant development in respect of those proceedings. This new development has led me to reassess the position which the chair should take in respect of that particular royal commission and also in respect of royal commissions generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 5 September Commissioner Marks outlined the issues which he believed the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) may possibly be facing in the royal commission's inquiries. For the information of honourable members, I present a copy of the statement of possible issues regarding Dr Lawrence identified by the royal commissioner. The identification by the commissioner of these issues has made it clear that the inquiry is now explicitly investigating the propriety of the actions of Dr Lawrence. This had not been previously spelt out as such and could not have been so specifically interpreted from the terms of reference of the royal commission. Previous rulings of the chair were based on the earlier situation and, in my view, have been substantiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice </EMPHASIS>indicates that there is not a blanket prohibition on the discussion of matters before a royal commission. Page 491 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice </EMPHASIS>states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proceedings before a royal commission or judicial inquiry shall not be referred to in motions, debate or questions where the matter inquired into concerns issues of fact or findings relating to the propriety of the actions of specific persons.</PARA>
<PARA>However, as indicated at page 494 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, the contemporary view is that a general prohibition of discussion of the proceedings of a royal commission is too broad and restricts the House unduly. It is necessary for the chair to consider the nature of the inquiry in each case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having regard to the new circumstances, I have reviewed the matter to determine whether the chair should allow further references to the substance of the royal commission's inquiry to be made in the proceedings of the House. The question at issue is whether further references to those proceedings would lead to a risk of prejudicing the position of parties and witnesses before the royal commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The terms of reference of this royal commission do not provide for it to inquire into whether there has been any breach of a law of the Commonwealth. The issues before the commission have a highly political element. While references in this House may have some influence on the proceedings of the royal commission, the accepted interpretation of the purposes of the sub judice convention&mdash;namely, to prevent the possibility of exerting an influence on juries and from prejudicing the position of parties and witnesses in court proceedings&mdash;do not apply in this case. Accordingly, on balance I have concluded that there is no reason to prevent further references to the proceedings of the royal commission in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of royal commissions generally, I have to say that I have now concluded that it would be quite wrong to subscribe to the view that has been expressed that the sub judice convention should not continue to be applied to royal commissions. There is a compelling case for each royal commission to be judged on its merits and, in my view, it would be inappropriate to make such a general pronouncement. I am aware that this matter is one that has caused concern to some members. I hope that this statement will help to clarify the issues involved. The difficulties in this case have been compounded by the highly political nature of the royal commission. However, my role is to endeavour to ensure that proper processes are followed in this House. The application of the sub judice convention is always subject to the discretion of the chair, and it is up to the chair to make a judgment in each case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will observe that this statement confirms and supplements my earlier statement on the sub judice convention which I made to the House on 27 June 1994 in response to matters raised by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous). The conclusion I have reached has only been made after a very careful examination of all the issues involved, a recognition of the amount of publicity this matter has already received, and it is not inconsistent with rulings given previously in respect of the sub judice convention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I wish to take up the time of the House for a moment to comment on this sub judice convention and, in particular, respond to some of the things that you have said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, as this is a significant issue, and it was well known&mdash;we have made no secret of it&mdash;that we thought that the issue should be revisited by you, and given that you have now prepared a statement and made this statement in the House, I am disappointed that you did not see fit to provide us with a copy of your statement beforehand. That may not be the convention, but on this particular issue, if we had had the benefit of the statement even 20 minutes before you delivered it, it would have given us a chance to more carefully and more dispassionately respond to what you have had to say. I believe there to be no reason whatsoever why that sensible and usual courtesy on other matters could not have been followed on this particular occasion. So that is my preliminary comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we have been very concerned at the earlier rulings and practice adopted by you in respect of the Easton matter in the previous fortnight that the House was sitting. You say in your statement to us that there has been a significant development since the House last sat, and you referred specifically to remarks of the royal commissioner which brought into focus the propriety of actions by the federal Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). You said that the fact that the commissioner had detailed aspects of her behaviour which may reflect on her provided the basis for you to make the statement that you have just made. Quite frankly, Mr Speaker, I would have to say that that is entirely a red herring. In fact, I think that you were quite wrong to say that. </PARA>

That does not give him the right to stand up and canvass what ought&mdash;if that is his view&mdash;to be properly a part of a motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! I am listening very carefully to the comments that the member for Flinders wants to make. But there is clearly a fine line between making some comments on the statement and then getting into a debate on the issue. I think the Leader of the House does raise a valid point. If you want to do that, there are appropriate forms of the House. But I am allowing you to continue under indulgence.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have given me indulgence so that I can comment on what you have had to say. The point I want to make is that during the debate, and particularly during question time on this issue, a point of order was raised by the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) which specifically went to the manner in which your ruling affected the questions and the response of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at that time. The member for Menzies then quoted to you from page 494 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> and, in particular, the explanation of the sub judice rule by former Speaker Snedden. If it were a jury matter and a criminal matter and we were discussing matters in the parliament and that might affect the views of the jury, that would clearly be a breach of the sub judice rule. That is obvious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also obvious, as you yourself have just said in quoting page 494 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, that it is not so easy to prejudice a royal commissioner&mdash;in this case a former judge who is an old hand at dealing with matters of public issue and controversy and who has experience that allows him objectively to come to his conclusions. That is all common ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that Snedden made, and that the member made for you at the particular time, though, was that by referring to and canvassing the likely outcome of a commission you could actually set up in the public's mind a view about what is going to happen. If the royal commissioner's conclusion coincides with what has been said in this place should happen, the public is going to be inclined to the view that the royal commissioner came to a particular view not because of his having heard the evidence but because of his having been influenced by what has happened in the parliament. It is that which would be a breach of the sub judice convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, that was the whole basis of the Prime Minister's attack on the Marks royal commission&mdash;he set out to taint the results of the royal commission. Blind Freddy could see that the Prime Minister does not want the conclusion to be reached by the Marks commission that a minister had lied. He does not want, therefore, the royal commission's findings to be of weighty evidence and persuasiveness to the Australian public so he set out to undermine the commission before it brings down its findings. That is in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, and that is the one thing we cannot do. You have said in your statement today there has been a development since we last sat which has given rise to what you have had to say. But the development that has arisen since last time is irrelevant. The Prime Minister set out deliberately to taint and to undermine the findings of the royal commission. We cannot do that. That is a breach of the sub judice convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, of course, the parliament as the premier forum in the country can debate great national issues of the day. This is only a convention. In other words, if we want to talk about the level of tax in Australia and there is a royal commission examining tax issues, obviously nothing can prevent the federal parliament from discussing any issue at any time. That must always be the case in a democracy. What you cannot do, though, is use your position in here to undermine, to taint, to prejudice or to devalue the work of an independent royal commission. That is what you cannot do. There has never been any question about that&mdash;absolutely none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, your coming in here today with this statement, which you did not give us the benefit of reading beforehand, is just a mopping up exercise after all the damage has been done. The horse has bolted. The Prime Minister set out deliberately to undermine the royal commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I have with me a copy of your reported remarks in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 6 September which state:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This meant the only restriction on the Coalition's use of commission evidence to attack Dr Lawrence would be "political judgment".</PARA>
<PARA>I am not quite sure where that statement sits now with what you have had to say today. If you are now taking us back to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, which was departed from in the last fortnight's sitting, that is in a sense a worthwhile contribution to make. But I wonder now whether or not that fits with what the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) said on 24 August:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> is quite clear on this. You cannot, under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, go into the detail of consideration of royal commission matters, which have not quite the same level of protection that court matters have, but have liberality only in the areas where they go to dealing with great matters of national policy and national issues of that nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When they get into the issues that are directly related to a person's situation in matters before a royal commission, they have commonly been regarded in this House as sub judice . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the House made that statement which, in his tactics meeting with the Prime Minister, he was very quick to disregard. We then saw the Prime Minister's attack on the commission. The knowing smile of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) only confirms my speculation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House ought to comply with its conventions. We have very clear practice in respect of the matter of sub judice. In the past, Speakers from both sides of the House have required compliance with that convention and that practice. In the last fortnight's sitting, that convention went completely out the window. You were happy to acquiesce in as blatant a breach of the convention as has been seen in this parliament. You have now provided us with some further statement, the impact of which I have yet to assess. It is not clear from what you have said today what it is that we can ask at question time today. I will obviously consider that matter over the next couple of hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I think the whole episode has been most regrettable. It could not have been clearer that the convention was breached. I do not think it is reasonable to say that things have happened in the interim that affect the way in which we approach this issue. The truth is that the convention and the way in which it should be approached has always been clear. That is why I say to you that what we had in the last sitting was a very clear breach. I would like to see us return to the practice as outlined by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, but in a sense we have little say over it. The truth of the matter is that the government will for its own political purposes push the extremes of the convention and practice. Unless you are prepared to stick more closely in the future to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, we can only complain; we are powerless to prevent the abuses which we saw last time we sat. I hope it has been a salutary lesson for all. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)acknowledges the need for Australian workers to save for their retirement to ensure the burden on the Government and Australian taxpayers is minimised;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)as such, recognises the massive imposts under the guise of account and management fees that are imposed on individuals' retirement funds and the disincentive this causes to saving and the subsequent burden which is placed on taxpayers;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)calls on the Government to provide policies which encourage savings for retirement; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)opposes any taxes or changes which discourage saving.</PARA>
<PARA>I tabled this motion back in February after I had been approached by a number of constituents who had experienced some difficulties with their superannuation funds. Nevertheless, the thrust of the motion is broader than superannuation itself. Today's news of Australians being the richest people in the world per capita should not lure us into a false sense of believing that everything is fine, because quite clearly it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern of my constituents was that there was no incentive to save&mdash;be it through superannuation, bank accounts, investments or wherever. Any benefits that were accrued just disappeared in fees, charges or taxes. I imagine that over the coming months we will probably see new accounts proposed by banks that will have no fees&mdash;but they will carry very few benefits with them&mdash;to accommodate lower income earners who cannot keep their balance above the minimum level which avoids account keeping fees and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read today that the chief executive of the Commonwealth Bank has called on the federal government to do something to assist the states in eliminating state taxes on accounts and so on. This motion calls on the government to provide policies which encourage savings for retirement and opposes any taxes or charges which discourage saving. In the big picture, the state taxes and charges on an individual account may not amount to a great deal, but it is still a very real disincentive to save. Why, people ask me, should they try to save when the interest they receive is eaten up by taxes, charges and other associated fees?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would actually like to see banks go back into schools and have special accounts for students so they learn the saving ethic much earlier in life. Obviously, this would need to be a community service by the banks but if they could establish a fee free, interest bearing account for schoolkids, the kids would develop the saving ethic earlier in life and understand the value of this when they find they want to buy a car or need a deposit for a home. They would need to take considerably more than the 1s 6d that I used to take to school tied up in the corner of a handkerchief. That was in the days when we had the little tins in the shape of the Commonwealth Bank building. I think the government could be encouraging such a scheme as well as assisting the states in scrapping taxes on accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expect members opposite will probably talk about superannuation. I do not think superannuation should be considered the be-all and end-all of a personal savings strategy&mdash;or a national savings strategy for that matter. The following letter is typical of many I have received and which, as I say, prompted me to move this motion. A lady called Claire, a constituent of mine, wrote to me about her son's superannuation statement, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is a student but gets occasional part time work. On the latest statement, you will note on September 30, 94 he had a balance $191.44. On October 18th, 94 after a whopping account servicing fee of $49.80 and superannuation taxes of $30.89, he now has $111.20. At this rate by the end of next year, should he get no more work from that employer, he will owe the bank. Some incentive, his hard earned money has helped make the bank wealthier.</PARA>
<PARA>We have, since then, had legislation passed which put in place member protection for those employees who had small amounts in their fund, to prevent them being eaten away by fees and charges. Member protection is well and good in that it prevents small accounts dissipating into nothing. However, this motion calls on the government to provide policies which encourage savings for retirement. Member protection does not encourage savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent survey by the Australian Consumers Council showed that 50 per cent of participants in superannuation believe that it is a very poor investment. Another survey found that young people between 18 and 25 believe it is too early to be involved in superannuation, people between 25 and  45 believe they have too many other financial commitments, and those between 45 and 55 believe it is too late to start saving for retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a retirement income strategy in place so that, with our ageing society, the burden of looking after the aged in their retirement does not fall entirely on the taxpayer. We cannot expect everyone to simply rely on superannuation, and the government's superannuation strategy should not be considered the panacea to solving the retirement income needs of the aged over the next 30 to 50 years and beyond. Often, we do not look far enough ahead in this country when we are planning&mdash;it is a matter of planning from election to election. Another example I would like to quote is from another constituent of mine, Steve, who wrote to me about his super fund:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Briefly, the fund to which I am contributing is performing so appallingly that I now see there is no way they can claim to be helping fund my retirement . . . We are not poor, but we work hard and halfway through my working life the time has come to cut our losses on this fund. 13 years of contributions to it totalling $21,530 are now valued at a paltry $22,898. Last year they lost me $495. If the fund managers cannot do any better, then quite frankly they should go back to university.</PARA>
<PARA>What should I tell someone like Steve&mdash;`Don't worry mate, you're a millionaire'? Where is the incentive for him? Admittedly, it is up to the super funds to manage his investments. But then, if that is the argument members opposite will offer, the claim of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that workers will have a goldmine when they retire will be dependent on, firstly, the workers working a certain number of years&mdash;which is highly unlikely&mdash;and, secondly, the super fund managing the investment so that it has earnings similar to the predictions of the Prime Minister. So it is still a gamble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another gentleman contacted me about his son, who had been an apprentice hairdresser. The young man's superannuation payments were going into an AMP fund. He left the employer making contributions to AMP to work for another employer. The new employer did not want to make payments to the AMP fund and instead paid his superannuation contributions into a fund with National Superannuation Plan. The young man later left that employment to study theology. Students of theology receive a benefit of only $2,000 per annum, meaning he had a need to claim the payments which he had made to his super funds. AMP was no problem. It paid him back his $1,500-odd. The National Superannuation Plan, however, has held off paying back his $500 for a number of months now and he still does not have it. It is little wonder that people lack faith in superannuation in general and in superannuation funds in particular. When people need their money and are eligible to claim it, some funds are reluctant to be user friendly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are living in an ageing society. In 1961, seniors&mdash;that is, persons aged 60 years or more&mdash;made up 11 per cent of Western Australia's population. In 1991, they constituted 14 per cent. It is anticipated that, by 2021, nearly one in every four Western Australians will be a senior. It is more than apparent that, during their working lives, Australians need to be encouraged to save for their retirement. If they do not, the burden on the government, and thus the taxpayers, will be enormous. While superannuation is the common form of retirement income provision, some people choose other avenues such as negative gearing on property investments, investing in the stock market and so on. When considering retirement income policies, these factors also need to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point worth noting at this stage&mdash;this motion calls on the government to provide policies which encourage savings for retirement&mdash;is that self-funded retirees are particularly hard done by. Not only do we need policies which encourage saving in the first place; we also need to ensure that when people retire to live on their savings they are not treated unfairly vis-a-vis pensioners. We may have great retirement income policies, but the incentive will soon go out the door when people notice how poor is the treatment of self-funded retirees. What sort of example are we setting for the younger people in our society when they see what happens to this particular group? The existing tax system threshold disadvantages self-funded retirees. While I am fully supportive of our pensioners, who have every right to the benefits they receive, I do empathise with the plight of self-funded retirees, who are treated quite dissimilarly to pensioners in many ways. I particularly mention the different tax-free threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt the major area of retirement income today is superannuation. The coalition has acknowledged the importance of this by having a superannuation portfolio. We will have a policy on this issue which will provide an incentive to save for retirement. Superannuation needs to be easily understood by the people who use it as well as being worth while, flexible and, probably most importantly, simple. Unfortunately, it seems this is not the case with superannuation today. The anecdotes I have offered back this up. It comes back to the thrust of this motion: there needs to be an incentive to provide for one's retirement, and that incentive simply does not exist today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the motion moved today by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron). The contribution of the member for Stirling really demonstrates the central problem that we have in Australian politics and in Australian public policy; that is, the Liberal and National parties are part of this country's saving problem. That is why they simply cannot be part of a savings solution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last budget introduced into this House was all about saving. It was about public and private saving. What did the opposition have to say about that? They came into this House trying to knock off the savings strategy by undermining the budget surplus to the tune of $2.5 billion in the out years through their action in opposing revenue measures. They also came into this House opposing compulsory superannuation. So when it comes to a saving policy, or any other policy for that matter, the opposition has not had a new idea in 12 years of opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has had one new idea, I guess&mdash;the new idea of the GST. Of course, the GST was a great savings policy for the rich, but it was one that would have flogged the battlers. The only new idea they have had in the area of savings in the last 12 years has been a GST, something that would have fundamentally redistributed income from low income earners to higher income earners. The people making the savings under the opposition's policy would have been those on high incomes. The people flogged to death would have been the battlers, whom those opposite sometimes pretend to be concerned with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrogance of the opposition in refusing to stand publicly for a savings policy is breathtaking. The opposition is condemned by most of the significant institutions in this country for its current lack of articulated policy. We can only consider the opposition's previous statements. However, before I go on to talk about that, let us consider what some of the significant institutional players in the policy scene have had to say about the nation's current strategy for savings. I quote from the AMP Society's latest edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super Trends</EMPHASIS>&mdash;issue 1 of August 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMP is a strong supporter of the need to increase national saving and we believe that superannuation is an essential contributor to that goal.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that runs directly contrary to many of the remarks previously made in this debate by members for the opposition. The AMP goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the last decade Australia has developed a world class superannuation system.</PARA>
<PARA>That remains completely unacknowledged by those opposite. The AMP goes on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only will our superannuation system contribute to better standards of living in retirement, so improving the well-being and lifestyles of retired Australians, but it will also contribute to a stronger economy by reducing Australia's reliance on foreign capital.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2V5">Mr SWAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us go on the record. I ask the honourable member for O'Connor: what is your savings policy? It is a pity that we do not get more policy debate from the opposition instead of the usual personal attacks and abuse. I would like to get down to the substance of policy&mdash;something which is not coming from the opposition. The AMP commissioned a model from Access Economics&mdash;and those opposite know a lot about Access Economics and place a lot of faith in that organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the model projects that there will be additional national savings of about one per cent of GDP and total superannuation assets of $462 billion as a result of the recent federal budget moves to lift contribution levels. That is a pretty significant endorsement by Access Economics of the federal government's national savings plan. The AMP model went on to make a few projections about the results of the plan. It projects that by 2003-04, as a result of current policies, there will be:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a reduction in the current account deficit of one per cent of GDP to about three to four per cent of GDP; a boost to national saving of around one per cent of GDP; lower inflation due to lower consumption and increased productivity from higher investment; a lowering of foreign debt by 3.4 per cent of GDP; an additional rise in GDP of 0.7 per cent; an extra 28,000 people in employment; and stronger long-term economic growth due to increased productive capacity with investment rising by an additional 0.7 per cent of GDP to 27 per cent. That is a pretty significant endorsement of the government's approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has had a lot to say about foreign debt. Those opposite go around the country claiming that we have unsustainable levels of foreign debt, but at the same time they are saying that the solution to foreign debt is savings. When we ask those opposite what is their savings policy they cannot tell us. They oppose the government's superannuation arrangements but they continually run around the country claiming that foreign debt is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us briefly look at what those opposite have to say about foreign debt. The opposition has been running around the country claiming that the federal government has put every Australian into hock to the tune of $10,000. That is a breathtakingly wild and inaccurate assertion. The opposition has been exaggerating the extent of foreign debt as part of its attempt to talk down the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia does have a net foreign debt of $180.5 billion, but the fact is that 60 per cent of that debt is private; that is, it is borrowed by Australian companies to expand their domestic capacities. Only four per cent of that debt is federal government debt. In other words, the Australian public is only liable for $406 per person&mdash;$7 billion instead of $180 billion. That shows the length to which the opposition will go to parade inaccurate statistics in its cynical approach to this forthcoming election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor does the opposition tell the public about the significant extent to which our capacity to repay the debt has been increased over time. Significantly, the debt service ratio has fallen from 20.6 per cent in 1990 to a low of 11.2 per cent in the June quarter of this year. In short, the federal government debt is not a burden on Australians. The low level of federal government debt reflects the fact that it has not borrowed offshore since 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This analysis is also backed up by other independent commentators. The opposition is quite fond of quoting many overseas reports on the Australian economy, so I will quote what Moody's had to say in June this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is quite clear that the Australian government, as well as a large segment of the population at large&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>except the Liberal and National parties, I might add&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">by now understands the savings/investment problem. In fact, there are a number of very important economic studies regarding the savings question in Australia&mdash;studies that have put the level of public discourse regarding this question well ahead of a number of other developed countries. In fact, several important steps have already been undertaken. Clearly, an important element has been the stabilization of the underlying inflation rate.</PARA>
<PARA>Moody's went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the recently proposed budget, the government supported the phased introduction of employee contributions to superannuation, in addition to the existing provisions for employer provided superannuation contributions. The government also called for a promised tax cut to be instead turned into a government co-contribution to workers' superannuation funds. These are the types of policy that fit well with Australia's savings/investment problem.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, almost all of the independent commentators around the country have correctly identified that the government has correctly identified the savings investment imbalance and has taken the proper corrective policy action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we got from the opposition in response to this? We have tried to put in place a budget surplus; that has been opposed. We have tried to put in place a national private savings plan through superannuation; that has been opposed. We have tried to put in place an accord with the trade union movement to keep inflation low; that has been opposed. What is the opposition's plan? To continually oppose&mdash;to oppose revenue measures in this House, to propose spending increases, to oppose revenue increases and, at the same time, in an act of monumental hypocrisy, to call for tighter fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have really had from the opposition has been continual scaremongering and cynical opportunism which is used as a camouflage, if you like, for the fact that the opposition does not have any concrete policies. Nowhere is this more evident than in superannuation. The opposition has consistently, over a long period, failed to match our commitment to ensuring the adequacy of the pension. For example, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) knocked off the CPI indexation of pensions. That showed the opposition's contempt for pensioners. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that whenever a notion or idea becomes an article of faith&mdash;that is to say, anyone who disagrees with it is ridiculed or attacked&mdash;it is almost always wrong. In economic policy this is just as true as in many other fields of policy. These days with our current account deficit identified as a chronic problem, which grows worse each time the economic cycle revolves, the accepted faith is that the entire answer to this chronic problem lies in boosting national savings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition that I want to put to the House today in rising to speak to the motion of my honourable friend the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) is that that is not entirely the case. You cannot have a savings policy existing alone. To persist with that policy without matching reforms in other parts of the economy may even exacerbate the problems we have with our current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion that the member has moved today deals with national savings in four ways. It talks about the need to lift the savings rate. It talks about the high fees and charges imposed on Australians who invest their money, hard won gains, in superannuation and in other savings vehicles. It also talks about the obvious flaws in the government's saving policy and finishes with what I take to be a plea to the government to ease the tax burden on those people who are trying to save. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will divide my remarks today into two parts: one dealing with the need for savings and the other dealing with those high fees and charges that all of us have been suffering. Two main reasons are given for the urgent nature of the need for savings. The first is that we have to save more in order to reduce the burden on government because the baby boomer generation is growing older. I hope that in the autumn of their life those baby boomers represented on the front bench of this government reflect upon the damage that they have inflicted on this country during their time in government&mdash;damage that people of my generation and those younger will have to spend the next decade repairing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason most often given for this urgent need is that we have to increase the pool of domestic capital that is available to satisfy the investment needs of Australia and to reduce our reliance on foreign debt. Those two aims can be achieved to some degree by raising the rate of savings, but I am worried that in following this urge we may fall victim to what I call the grand scheme syndrome. It worries me that in recent decades Australian governments have fallen prey to the tendency to construct grand policy schemes in the ludicrous hope that somehow a grand scheme can deal with an intractable problem at the stroke of a pen, instead of concentrating on making smaller, more nuts and bolts decisions which by their very nature are perhaps less popular with the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many examples of this grand scheme syndrome. For example, it is said that all our trade woes will magically disappear if we integrate with Asia; the answer lies with Asia and, as long as we go along with what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) tell us about our shortcomings in that area, all will be well. Another example of this grand scheme syndrome is our so-called national identity crisis. I cannot say that I, my family, my friends or acquaintances are obviously suffering from some crisis in identity every morning whilst eating our Special K, but we are told from members of the government benches that we do suffer from such a crisis. What will be the solution to this appalling state of affairs? If we became a republic, our national identity crisis would be solved overnight. All we have to do is agree with everything that the government says in its grand scheme and she'll be right, mate; all will be well!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With our current account deficit problem, again we are told that, if we all pile into a huge and compulsory superannuation scheme, somehow or other everything will be all right. The member for Lilley (Mr Swan) quoted from the AMP Society, that marvellously objective body which I understand is now owned by a French company. What a crass irony it is that, in the year when the Republic of France is detonating nuclear bombs in our backyard, one of the authorities from which the member for Lilley quoted is now in French hands. Provided we understand that a savings policy alone is not enough, I think we are somewhere along the right road to a solution to the current account deficit problem and the problem of a generally moribund economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of policies that have to accompany a growing pool of savings include fiscal rectitude&mdash;that is, we have to do something about our habitual reliance on government budget deficits. We have to do whatever we can to improve productivity in the workplace, and we have to strive to reduce the tax burden&mdash;at least the burdensome taxes that we impose on new enterprises&mdash;in order to foster innovation. You need to match innovation in the workplace. If you create an enormous pool of domestic savings without doing something to liberate the supply side of an economy to provide the sorts of goods and services that Australians rightfully crave when they have more money in their pockets, you can end up with something worse than what you started with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An obvious example of that is the economy in Japan. It is in a frightening state because of a similar grand folly in its economic policy over the last 20 or 30 years. After the war, during its period of reconstruction it set about forcing people to save more money. In doing so, it created a huge pool of savings. It combined that with astonishing growth in productivity in the workplace, but it placed restrictions on where that great pool of savings could be invested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, Japan forced people into domestic assets, land prices, stock prices, share prices and even golf club memberships. This notion that everything had to be invested domestically and that people should be frightened of foreign products or foreign companies has led to the absurd situation where these assets are now so overpriced that the economy is suffering from deflation. The prices of these assets are falling. They will continue to fall until they reach a level where a proper return on equity is achievable. It is precisely because Japan took a myopic attitude that all they had to do was increase their domestic savings and all would be well that they have reached this appalling state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is like the driver of a car with an engine that is not working properly taking the car to a petrol station, instead of to a garage to get a mechanic to diagnose the problems in the engine and fix them, filling up the tank with a higher grade of petrol and saying to everybody, `Look at me. My petrol tank is full. Watch me go.' It may even be that they change the colour of the paint on the car and say, `Look at this.' The performance of the car is no better. In fact, it will only get worse the further down the highway the car travels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is amusing for me to look in that way at the savings horizon of Australia. We see some bad things and we see some good things. Let me deal reluctantly with the bad ones first. The worst one of all and the one which makes me laugh the most is the government's campaign to educate the electorate&mdash;that is, us&mdash;about the benefits of its superannuation policy. What does it do in order to educate us, the people of the electorate? It uses a cartoon of a man with a wheelbarrow full of money and a whole lot of little trees in pots where money grows like leaves.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion moved today by the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron), my colleague from Western Australia, has four parts. It asks that the House, firstly, acknowledges the need for Australian workers to save for their retirement; secondly, recognises the imposts under the guise of account and management fees; thirdly, calls on the government to provide policies which encourage savings for retirement; and, fourthly, opposes any taxes or changes which discourage saving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was entirely bemused to discover that members of the opposition had actually discovered superannuation because, if the truth be told, members opposite have not had an interest in superannuation. When this government came to office in 1983, superannuation had been treated by those opposite as basically a tax deduction for upper middle and high income earners. There was no notion of having a national plan for retirement incomes and no notion of having a national plan for savings, either private or public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the decade&mdash;it is now longer than a decade&mdash;that has occurred since this government came to office in 1983, we have seen effectively the creation of a major national industry: the superannuation industry. We have seen massive boosts to national savings through superannuation and we have seen major improvements in the retirement income capacities of many Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you simply go to the decade of reform from 1983 to 1993, you can see from the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures of June 1993 the massive expansion in superannuation and the access of ordinary Australian workers to superannuation in the course of that decade&mdash;and, of course, the figures have improved since then. In June 1993, the ABS relevant statistics were saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation coverage of employed Australians rose to 80 per cent in November 1993. This continues the upward trend reported in November 1991 when the level of superannuation coverage had increased from 51 per cent in November 1988 to 71 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, these figures come off the low of 40 per cent which we inherited when we came to office in 1983. The ABS went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.1 million employed people aged 15 to 74 were covered by a superannuation scheme . . .  82 per cent of men had superannuation coverage . . . The level of coverage for women was 78 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wage and salary earners reported the highest superannuation coverage rate with 89 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>We have seen in the decade since the government came to office a massive expansion in the access of ordinary Australian workers and taxpayers to superannuation. It is quite bemusing to see those opposite now suddenly discovering an interest in this important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the net effect of policy to date? There has been a massive expansion of access to superannuation which brings with it very important consequences for retirement incomes and a massive boost to the potential for contribution to national savings. The initiatives which we saw in this year's budget build on those previous policies and the previous record of a decade of reform by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What you now see in place is a national superannuation policy which seeks to enhance and further expand both the access to superannuation and the contribution that superannuation makes to national savings. The member for Stirling, in his motion, calls on the government to provide policies which encourage savings for retirement. All you have to do is refer to a speech made by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to the Association of Superannuation Funds to find the philosophical attitude behind the government's retirement incomes and superannuation policies. The Treasurer on that occasion said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's retirement incomes policy will continue to have three elements:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the age pension and associated social security arrangements, which provide an income safety net in retirement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>safety nets are something which those opposite regard as anathema or have no interest in&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a compulsory saving element, achieved through the Superannuation Guarantee and now minimum employment contributions required under industrial agreements and awards; and a voluntary element of superannuation, encouraged by the substantial tax concessions available for superannuation saving and the Government's matching payments.</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures will result in most employees having the equivalent of 15 per cent of their earnings directed towards their retirement savings from 2002.</PARA>
<PARA>He also went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matching Government contribution is specifically targeted to low and middle income earners. This group includes a significant proportion of women who, prior to 1983, traditionally missed out on access to superannuation benefits and concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The end result will be significantly higher incomes in retirement for ordinary workers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the philosophical approach of the government. It is one the government stands by and has stood by since it came to office in 1983. That stands in stark contrast to the approach by and attitude of those opposite when they were in power prior to 1983 and stands in stark contrast to the attitude expressed recently by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). Mr Howard was sprung quite adroitly by an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 28 August&mdash;late last month. Mr Megalogenis, one of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>'s economic reporters, under the heading `Battlers will be the first to fall into Howard's super trap' says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Howard and Peter Costello risk the credibility of their economic attacks on the Government if they persist in making misleading outbursts on superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Howard tarnished his self-image as an honest politician this month when he said that Keating's promise of a super bonanza is "very deceitful and a distortion of the facts".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Howard said: "He [Keating] runs around Australia saying under his policy workers will be able to retire on $480,000. The problem is it only applies to somebody who's now younger than 11."</PARA>
<PARA>The writer of this article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Howard was wrong on two counts. The number Keating has been quoting out of the Budget papers is $462,000; and the person he refers to is now 18 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Leader of the Opposition has given a massive, deliberate and complete distortion of the implications of some of the measures contained in the budget. Mr Megalogenis goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Howard compounded his error with his attempt to rebut Treasurer Ralph Willis's claims that workers would lose up to $250,000 in benefits under the apparent Coalition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"He [Willis] was quite dishonestly observing that I was going to snuffle out workers' superannuation entitlements. . . we're certainly not going to leave people worse off as far as superannuation is concerned," Howard said.</PARA>
<PARA>There is some helpful analysis from Mr Megalogenis on this. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What Willis was saying was clear enough. If the Coalition maintains its present policy to freeze the Superannuation Guarantee Charge at the levels applying at the next election, then ordinary workers would end up with much lower payouts than under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the key point. That is a constant and recurring theme, showing the real attitude of those opposite, whatever they express. Ordinary workers would end up being worse off under them than they are under the current government, be it with superannuation or the award conditions, wages and entitlements they could expect to receive from those opposite. In his article, Mr Megalogenis goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Willis argument is self-evident&mdash;a 5 or 6 per cent SGC will deliver a smaller super benefit than the 15 per cent benchmark being phased in by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Howard will be vulnerable on this point for as long as he continues to put off industry and employer calls to embrace bipartisanship on the SGC. Howard would have a hard time supporting the line run by John Hewson at the last election that a freeze on the SGC somehow preserves people's existing entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Megalogenis finishes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is Howard's battlers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a perverse combination of words&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the low-income workers who cannot afford to top up their super&mdash;who are the most vulnerable. Freezing the SGC and then providing tax incentives for voluntary savings above that level will not help them break out of the small-amounts trap.</PARA>
<PARA>The complete answer to the motion moved by the member for Stirling is contained in the policies that the government has adopted over the last 10 years. It is contained in the policies indicated by the government in the most recent budget so far as national savings and superannuation are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final rebuttal to the motion moved by the member for Stirling is the attitude the opposition took when it was previously in government and the attitude and policies which the Leader of the Opposition is now personally handcuffed to, ensuring that ordinary workers will be worse off under the coalition with respect to wages, entitlements or superannuation. </PARA>

The other disadvantaged people under Labor's proposals are those who earn less than the average wage, and that is by far the greater number of the Australian work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in the honourable gentleman's observation that this motion represents some new interest by members on this side of the House. Let me assure the honourable member and the House that there have been umpteen bills on superannuation introduced by this government and on many of them there has not been one single speaker on the Labor side to uphold, defend or in other ways promote Labor's superannuation programs. On so many occasions we have not had anyone to put the case for Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to go to a couple of points touched on by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) earlier. What he says about what the superannuation scheme means to domestic savings worries me. It may or may not prove to be the case that domestic savings are improved as a result of Labor's compulsory superannuation scheme. There tends to be grave exaggeration when people like the honourable member for Lilley say what he had to say about the effect on domestic savings. There is no evidence yet that compulsory superannuation will increase domestic savings. Indeed, there must be extreme doubt. There is a very real possibility that superannuation as it is now constituted and is being constituted will become a mere substitute for other forms of domestic savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might expect that those people now making provision for their own retirement or of a mind to do so some time in the not too distant future will reach the point of view that because they are making compulsory contributions that will be sufficient to meet their needs in retirement. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have said before in this place&mdash;and I do mean it sincerely&mdash;that I wish the government would tone down its rhetoric in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter the honourable member for Lilley touched on is that somehow superannuation as it is now constituted is going to make a great contribution to reducing our indebtedness in this country. He went on to say that the Commonwealth is not responsible for our high level of debt, that it has only borrowed something like four per cent of our net overseas borrowings. The truth is that in the last two or three years the government will increase its borrowing requirements by $50 billion to some $90 billion. It does not matter whether it borrows that $50 billion overseas or in Australia. The truth is that it will probably borrow it in Australia. Those in the private sector will in that case be crowded out. It is the crowding out effect which we have heard mentioned before which is conveniently ignored by people like the honourable member for Lilley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government borrows $50 billion on the Australian financial markets, others who need to take up the slack will have to borrow overseas. It is as simple as that. On top of that, of course, no superannuation scheme is going to offset our disastrous balance of trade and balance of payments figures. They are at the heart of this country's indebtedness. The superannuation scheme that we are talking about now is not going to overcome that fact. So we have the government exaggerating the effects of superannuation in the run-up to the next election because it does not have very much else to peddle, if you think about it. The truth is that there are still people who will at the end of their time need to rely on the public sector to finance their retirement, and this scheme is not going to alter that one jot. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This private member's motion is concerned with two essential things&mdash;the question of adequate provision for retirement income and the question of national savings. The opposition's approach to these two issues has displayed almost breathtaking cynicism.  A lot has been said on the part of members of the opposition about these particular questions. But the fact that there has been no announcement, no presentation, no statement of policy in connection with them indicates the superficial approach that the opposition has made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just by way of example, the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron), who moved this private member's motion&mdash;presumably to indicate his concern and that of his colleagues about these two important areas of retirement income and national savings&mdash;has not even remained in the chamber to hear the debate through. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that is an unfortunate practice which is starting to intrude into the operation of this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are occasions when, for the sake of courtesy and procedure, it is important for people to remain in the chamber, and it disappoints me to see practices and courtesies of that kind starting to go by the way. However, there are a number of members on both sides of the chamber who are aware of them, who recognise them and who act according to them. The particular point I make is that the absence of the member for Stirling from this debate&mdash;a debate which is taking place as a result of the motion relating to retirement income and national savings which that member has moved&mdash;indicates, as I said, the breathtaking cynicism with which the opposition has approached these questions generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who spoke before me, is one of the better-informed members. As we know, he now sits on the cross benches because, despite the fact that he is well informed on superannuation and questions of this kind, he has been abandoned by the Liberal Party. I do not know who the party has chosen to replace him after the next election. But I know he is standing as an Independent and, because he is well informed, I expect he will be successful in pursuing a return to this parliament. However, one of the points made by the member for Curtin was that, in his assessment, there are two important groups of people who are not being provided with adequate attention under this government's approach to superannuation: itinerant workers, and people who have interrupted periods of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it becomes possible for a former member of the opposition, now an Independent, to compress into just those two relatively small groups of people perhaps what he attempts to identify as some inadequacy in superannuation, it reflects admirably on the approach that this government has made to the whole question of superannuation. Everyone knows that, before 1983, when this government first came into office, less than 40 per cent of all wage and salary earners in Australia were covered by any form of superannuation&mdash;I repeat: less than 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not need to guess really hard to determine who the people were who were covered by superannuation provisions at that time. They were the wealthiest, the highest income earners in the community&mdash;and they were essentially males. Less than 25 per cent of women in employment in 1983 were covered by any form of superannuation provision for their retirement security. Now, as a result of the policies that this government has put into place, 90 per cent of wage and salary earners can be assured that, on their retirement, they will have appropriate levels of superannuation to supplement that basic safety net of the old age pension and to ensure that they do have an appropriate level of retirement security from those incomes. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)notes the continuing problem in the construction and building industry of subcontractors not being paid by contractors, resulting in bankruptcy, liquidations and loss of jobs;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)maintains that the Commonwealth should set the example as a client to enter into contracts conditional upon the main contractor paying subcontractors before further payments or progress payments are made;</PARA>

<PARA>The terms of the motion are self-explanatory and I believe should receive the bipartisan support of all members of this House, as indicated by the fact that the member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys) has agreed to second the motion and because we all understand the problems created throughout Australian business by payments to subcontractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion speaks of a long-term problem in our building and housing industry: the non-payment to subcontractors by contractors right across Australia. It is not only an Australian problem; it is a worldwide problem. Some of the other developed nations have taken various remedial actions, but Australia and Great Britain are two exceptions to this remedial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I want to say that I am not embarking on an exercise against builders and contractors. For any proposal to succeed it must be recognised that there are many parties to any construction project: the client, the provider of finance, the builder, state legislators providing standards, subcontractors, providers of material, and tradespeople. All these need consideration in any proposal that is put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past decade we have seen, firstly, an upgrading of the licensing provisions of state governments for builders; secondly, standard construction contracts, approved by state governments, as agreements between client and contractor; thirdly, states and the federal government have insisted on quality assurance right across the trade; and, fourthly, various states have implemented legislation for a subcontractors' charges act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, we would feel that Australia has a fully accredited building industry and now requires an effective and secure payments system for all those parties who contribute towards the contract undertaken. The reality is that Australia has no system to ensure that funds made available to a contract are paid out, fully and on time, to all those who are a party to the contract and who provide material and labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a Commonwealth level, the Joint Committee on Public Works for the period of this year has been adding to its recommendations one that calls on the Commonwealth or its departments to ensure payment to subcontractors of progress and final payments.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is on fairly safe grounds. The client&mdash;that is, the Commonwealth&mdash;has been allocated the funds and will pay the contract price and approved extras. By contracting with the builder to pay subcontractors, the Commonwealth is in a unique position to implement a system and lead, by example, the various states and territory authorities. We are advised by the departments that this has operated very successfully over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would consider then that the states and territories, again as the client with the funds appropriated, would act in exactly the same way as the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and I quote my own state of Queensland as an example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> reported on 7 June 1995 that at the same time as the Premier of Queensland was opening with glitter the $203 million Brisbane Convention Centre, a contract for which the Queensland government was the client, Leighton Contractors faced writs from an electrical subcontractor, a scaffolding subbie, Evans Deakin, and another subcontractor who is in provisional liquidation as a result of the failure, among many others. The administrative services minister, the Hon. Glen Millner, told parliament that about $25 million was still outstanding to five or six major subcontractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another is Q Build, where the same minister is responsible for public housing. On 12 July 1993, the minister wrote to a constituent firm of mine, which had a problem of payment on a state government contract, in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may be aware I recently announced the Government has moved to adopt new contractual provisions which give subcontractors a greater measure of protection of payment for all State Government major building projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cabinet has agreed the new contractual provisions will be embodied within the State Purchasing Policy, thus making them uniformly applicable to all major government building and construction projects. My own Department will be applying them to the construction of public housing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These new provisions will ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.in appropriate circumstances securities are available to satisfy Subcontractors claims;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.contractors lodge additional security or alternatively set up retention trust funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.specified forms of contracts are used for subcontracted works;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Contractors set up payment recording systems which will provide evidence from subcontractors that they have been paid all moneys due and payable at the time progress payments are claimed by Contractors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is concerned by the number of Subcontractors who have endured financial hardship because of the collapse, or unscrupulous actions, of building firms.</PARA>
<PARA>The same constituent business, addressed by the minister on 12 June 1993, subcontracting on another building with Q Build as the client, on 13 January 1995 was forced to secure an order from the Queensland Building Tribunal for $16,670 against the contractor. Again, the builder had received moneys from the state authority but had not applied them in the appropriate manner. This amount of $16,670 still remains unpaid along with $300,000 of additional creditors&mdash;$128,714 in additional subcontractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 24 February 1995 the builder petitioned under the Bankruptcy Act to declare total liabilities of $326,000 and a deficiency of funds of $310,000. Q Build had apparently paid the contract price without any reference to the undertaking given by the same minister on 12 July 1993. This result is a failure on behalf of the state government to ensure payment to subbies and has led to a closure of business, a resultant loss of experienced labour and further unemployment, in spite of their best intentions as was indicated by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to reiterate that, in any failure of a building contractor, there is a massive domino effect that could mean bankruptcy or liquidation of subbies, material suppliers and unemployed tradespeople. The Commonwealth loses from taxation on these profits and there is an increase in social security payments and in the cost of material and labour to overcome the inherent risk factor caused through previous failures in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third scenario that the motion addresses is the one where the failure of government to act has created the biggest problem, and that is in the non-government sector: the private sector. This failure is almost a common, everyday feature of Australian business life&mdash;examples of which have happened in Mackay very recently and ended in a public meeting for the subcontractors. Here the government, state or federal, has little control except by way of setting standards, and often the client can be the problem as much as the contractor through insecure and inadequate financial arrangements. The reality of the Subcontractors' Charges Act, where it exists, is that if a subcontractor wishes to register his name with the client for preferred payment then he may get that job but will not get any further work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normally a supplier of materials to a job can insist on personal or directors' guarantees and can ensure against bad debts. This avenue is not available to a subbie whose business normally does not have the same degree of administration as does a client, a contractor or a supplier of materials. I understand other countries have enacted legislation to ensure payment to subcontractors through a trust account. While the business industry is regulated by the licensing and accreditation procedures and quality assurance, surely it is not outside the enterprise of government to legislate to protect all parties, although I am not recommending the trust account system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it must be said that there will always be a risk and no government should intervene to protect a person or persons who should make themselves aware of that risk and provide accordingly. Even on government jobs, a supplier of material, labour and service runs a degree of risk and more so if their administrative procedures and standards are not those required for a business successfully being conducted in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having outlined the problems which I believe are apparent to all the parties, I reiterate that the answer is not in recriminations&mdash;one against the other&mdash;or in public criticisms of government. The answer can be supplied only in an atmosphere of common purpose and goodwill between all the parties. I am therefore encouraged to find in the course of our Public Works Committee inquiries that there are bodies and committees which are working for that common purpose and goodwill, particularly in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am similarly encouraged to know that the federal Minister for Administrative Services, the Hon. Frank Walker, has endeavoured through his state ministerial council to suggest further work and cooperation to find solutions both in government contracts and in private contractual arrangements. A news clipping from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 31 May 1995 gives substance to this&mdash;that the standardisation by the ministers is being sought and they recognise a lot of the problems that are now being created within the building industry as being something they can collectively address. I thank the minister for his cooperation in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a royal commission into the productivity of the building industry of 1992 in New South Wales specifically addressing subcontractors and a separate report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cottage industry investigation: the money trail for the cottage industry</EMPHASIS>, which demonstrates that the subcontractors are responsible for a significant component of the value of building projects in New South Wales. There are other subcontractor groups forming within states with particular interest of the subbies in mind. There are various suggestions of copying from other nations&mdash;particularly Canada, Europe and the United States&mdash;in the forming of trusts and the providing of safeguards for interest groups, but I must say that the forming of trusts may not be the particular answer because of the cost involved with it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

We have present the very distinguished chairman of that committee, the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), and all the other members of the Public Works Committee. They are all committed.

I can honestly say that I do not believe there is a member or senator in this parliament who has not been approached by a subcontractor or a small business person who has been hurt by contractors not paying for their services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central issue of concern is the financial and emotional hardship experienced by subcontractors in the building industry who are faced with financial ruin when a contractor becomes insolvent. When I decided to speak on this notice of motion I contacted the Law and Public Administration Group of the Parliamentary Research Service in the Parliamentary Library and I spoke to Brendan Bailey, who has been very helpful in giving me information about the law. Brendan informed me that only two states have legislation to protect subcontractors and these are New South Wales and Queensland. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The New South Wales Industrial Relations Act 1991, at section 154, protects the wages of an "employee" of a contractor. The New South Wales law requires the person who engages the contractor to certify that no wages are due and payable by the contractor at the time of the payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, the Subcontractors' Charges Act 1974&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this goes back that far&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">creates a "charge" in favour of a subcontractor over the moneys payable to a contractor (section 5).</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to quote also from a paper that Brendan gave to me titled `Real and Personal Securities', written by Mr W.D. Duncan, a solicitor from Queensland, and Lindy Willmott. They say this about the Subcontractors' Charges Act of 1974:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the laudable objects of the legislation alleviating the financial risk of subcontractors, the legislation has received much criticism both by the judiciary and the builders' lobby in Queensland. Although the builders' lobby may have a vested interest in limiting the operation of the Act or wishing it repealed altogether, the criticisms made by the judiciary stem from the ambiguity of the legislation. As stated by Dunn J. in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ex p Pavex Constructions Pty Ltd</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>There is a wealth of information in this on the inadequacies of the legislation. I do not have time to go through all of the judgments referred to, but I can say that all of the big names in contractors&mdash;John Holland Constructions, et cetera&mdash;are involved in still refusing to pay subcontractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is up to this parliament and the state parliaments to introduce uniform legislation. It is important too to look at the 1995 report of the Victorian Law Reform Committee into the curbing of phoenix companies, which goes a long way towards curbing the activities of these people who deliberately refuse to pay very deserving subcontractors throughout our nation.

The member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) is something of an outsider participating in this debate, but I welcome his involvement as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stand here reflecting some of the member for Griffith's remarks, but with even more passion for subcontractors than he is prepared to show. I think that subcontractors are at the heart of business success in Australia. Fundamentally, subcontractors say, `What can I do better than anyone else?' and set out to prove the point. If we want to run a more efficient economy, we want people who believe in individual competition, in the right to bid for individual jobs and in the right to prove that they can outperform everybody else. Subcontractors fit this die. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key employment opportunities in Australia and the jobs that are the most demanding and the most labour intensive, particularly in such areas as the rural industry&mdash;jobs such as shearing or fruit picking&mdash;are invariably what could loosely be called subcontracted jobs. To choose to employ anyone in those vocations by any other basis would be a way of ensuring that the business went broke. Subcontracting is the way to get the best out of people. What the member for Dawson has called for in his motion today is an opportunity for governments at state and federal level to lead by example and remove what are current disincentives to subcontractors getting into business. It is fair to say&mdash;I know it is frequently misrepresented&mdash;that there is no interest quite like self-interest. It is self-interest that drives subcontractors to be as efficient as they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid that some of the remarks made by members of the government are a little conditioned. I refer to a comment made by the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) last month in a report from the magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inside Canberra</EMPHASIS>. The assistant minister was calling on a research project funded by Worksafe Australia where he wants the impact of subcontractors on the workplace to be evaluated. In his press release he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because they are paid for output, the pressure is on subcontractors to work long hours and often they work too fast with inadequate breaks. This means injuries are more likely to happen.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand and applaud the effort by the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations to eliminate unnecessary risk in the occupational health and safety areas. I think that is entirely commendable. But I have to say that I think that the opportunity to eliminate risk should be restricted only to occupational health and safety because the involvement of subcontractors in making real productivity increases ought to be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has just left the chamber. I am sorry that I did not have an opportunity earlier in my remarks to focus on one of the things that I recall him saying not only in this House but also in the opposition party room. He has, as a member of parliament, deliberately set about cultivating subcontractors and giving them an opportunity. Unemployed people who have come into his office have been given the opportunity to start their own subcontracting business, either as a result of lawn-mowing rounds or window cleaning rounds or what are seen as menial tasks that allow people to cease to be unemployed and be directly employed in the opportunities that go with being subcontractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Dawson, in bringing this motion into the House, has asked us to do as the member for O'Connor has done&mdash;that is, to set about encouraging the psyche of subcontracting, encouraging people to be independent, to stand on their own and to ensure that they have an opportunity to contribute to society and to see, frankly, that the sorts of arrangements that have existed in the past, which may have meant that subcontractors were innocently caught up in a bankruptcy claim and consequently not paid, are eliminated, so far as that is possible for the parliament to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamentally, the thrust of the member for Dawson's motion has been a call for legislation to protect the innocent. It is not possible for a subcontractor to know whether the contract that he has entered into&mdash;particularly a building contract in the case of the Public Works Committee&mdash;with the principal contractor is financially secure or not. That sort of information is even denied to shareholders in some principal building companies. It is highly unlikely that the subcontractor would know whether he is likely to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Dawson has set in place a proposal that suggests that both the Commonwealth and state governments should underwrite the payment to subcontractors, which would ensure that they are not placed at unreasonable risk. This is an entirely humane thing to do. Subcontractors are, after all, small businessmen. But, more than that, subcontractors employ people&mdash;which effectively ensures that additional people are taken out of the unemployment pool and placed in full-time employment&mdash;and those employees of subcontractors are also at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were an employee of a major business company that was going broke, I would have an opportunity to be part of the priority payment from that company that is going broke. In the same way that the creditors have an obligation to make provision for the tax arrangements of that company, they also have to make provision for the wages arrangements of that company's employees. But what happens to a subcontractor? He is an employee with no protection and also with no opportunity to protect his own frequently part-time employees. So this proposal gives us an opportunity not only to provide security for the subbie but also to provide security for the subbie's employees, whom all members on both sides of the House would clearly want protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The member for Griffith has said that subcontractors are `worthy of protection', and I endorse his remarks. He has indicated that some subcontractors are less honourable than others, as we all know, but that is nothing more than a reflection of society generally: it applies to employees as well as to subcontractors. What the proposal before the House does is to focus the attention of private employers on the arrangements that should be put in place to protect subcontractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The member for Dawson referred to the role of the Public Works Committee under its present chairman. In fact, the committee met this morning to look at two major projects. It considered the report on the project for the air traffic control facilities at Darwin. Paragraph 85 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence advised the Committee that payments to subcontractors will be protected as the Defence contracts will specify that contractors must specify that contractors have been paid before further payments are made to the contractors.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee also considered the proposal for expanded Defence facilities in Townsville. In response to an inquiry from the member for Dawson, the committee took deliberate action in relation to the protection of subcontractors. A portion of paragraph 79 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the managing contractor engages the subcontractors payments to subcontractors are made out of a trust account which is controlled by Defence.</PARA>
<PARA>The feasibility of providing such a trust account, which ensures that the employees of subcontractors and subcontractors themselves are not placed at unreasonable risk, is the mainspring behind the member for Dawson's motion. I am happy to be identified with such a motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to congratulate my colleague on the Joint Committee on Public Works the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) on his decision to raise the matter now before the House. It has been an issue that both he and the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys) have consistently raised in public hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well known that one of the worst things that can happen to anyone is to find himself or herself suddenly, and often quite unexpectedly, out of work and facing bankruptcy. The situation becomes even more intolerable when that person is married and has several young children to support. Should that person also have several other workers and their families depending on him or her for their livelihood, the problem becomes that much worse again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time, most unfortunately, this happens in all walks of life. We are used to hearing about such happenings in the farming community especially during times of severe drought, as we are now experiencing. We also hear similar accounts from people running small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hard to fully comprehend the pain and anguish suffered by those people and their families. Imagine for a moment a person who over the years has gradually developed a reputation for honest, competent and reliable work; a person who has built up a business over years of study and hard toil working long hours for only moderate gain. Imagine then the distress and the anger when that person quite suddenly, and through no fault or his or her own, loses practically everything he or she has worked for and can no longer support the family. We have all, I am sure, met such people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As chairman of the Public Works Committee, I have become aware of one particular group of people who are particularly prone to becoming victims of such extraordinary hardship&mdash;the subcontractors in the building and construction industry. Too often, it seems, through no fault of their own, those people suffer severe economic hardship because the main contractor who engages them for a particular piece of work on a building or construction site goes broke. When this happens, the subcontractor generally has no option but to join the long queue of other creditors, each of them hoping to retrieve some small percentage of what they are owed. For the subcontractor, failure to do so almost invariably leads to bankruptcy. It is my conviction, and it is one shared by other members of the Public Works Committee, that the time has come&mdash;and, indeed, is overdue&mdash;to address this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The security of payment problem has been commonplace throughout the building and construction industry for some years but has, it seems, become appreciably worse over the last decade. It is a problem that becomes more serious during periods marked by a downturn in building activity. During good times there is a proliferation of builders and major contractors but, when the industry experiences a downturn, in the mad scramble to gain contracts firms are tempted to tender at or below what they perceive to be the minimum cost. Is it any wonder then that a number of them experience cash flow problems and go bankrupt?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is even more acute for subcontractors. While security of payment has become a major issue in the building and construction industry generally, the subcontracting nature of most projects makes those lower in the chain particularly vulnerable to any insolvency at a higher level. Being in small business, subcontractors work on very limited capital at the best of times. They are faced with bills that must be paid promptly and they need the assurance of a reliable cash flow. This does not always happen. It is not at all uncommon that they may find themselves waiting for up to three months to be paid for their work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years, the security of payment problem has become the subject of considerable investigation. This, I am pleased to say, has resulted in a number of limited legislative measures, as the member for Griffith mentioned, in both New South Wales and Queensland. The time has now come when similar and stronger measures should be introduced by this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, as the honourable member for Dawson proposes, the Commonwealth should set the example in all its government contracts. A number of government departments, notably the Department of Defence, already protect subcontractors by including in their contract documents a clause which states that subcontractors must be paid before any further progress payments are made to the head contractor. The departments also insist that the head contractor must provide a statutory declaration that subcontractors have indeed been paid, and only then does the head contractor become eligible for further payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion now before the House would have the effect of making this practice mandatory for all federal government departments. I am realistic enough to acknowledge that legislation cannot of itself completely eliminate the security of payment problem. I am convinced, however, that such legislation can make a significant contribution to reducing the problem first of all in the area of government contracts and then by encouraging further enactments in the state and territory legislatures. I would also hope that such government initiatives would foster the development within the industry's private sector of a code of best practice which would seek to eliminate this problem altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I explained, when subcontractors are not paid by the head contractor there are massive social and economic costs which must be borne by the subcontractors and their employees and families. For this reason alone, we should be addressing the problem. It must also logically follow that if payments to subcontractors are to be protected, which we all agree they should, then payments to the employees of subcontractors should be protected also. We should make sure that the main contractors only employ subcontractors on these major building projects that have good track records and can provide the services required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, there are too many $2 companies. I have had experience in my own area&mdash;and I have recently led a delegation to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) on this issue&mdash;where those companies go bust and then form again with the same set of directors. If we are going to be strict on the main contractor, we must be equally strict on the subcontractors to make sure that they fulfil their requirements and protect those who work for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, a further reason for seeking to remove this problem. This problem has serious consequences for the entire building and construction industry and, consequently, for the nation. Several years ago the Security of Payments Industry Committee undertook a major study of the problem in New South Wales. It examined the records of several bankrupt companies as well as received evidence from contractors, subcontractors, suppliers and consultants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's chairperson concluded that the total losses in the industry during the year 1989-90 in New South Wales alone amounted to $1.1 billion from a turnover of $9.66 billion. This represents a loss of 11.3 per cent on the total investment. I should make it clear that this loss was spread throughout the overall industry and was not borne by the subcontractors alone. They, nevertheless, are in a particularly vulnerable position and are compelled to bear a disproportionately large share of the losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly true that there are available within the industry a number of standard building industry contracts. Their use must be encouraged until such time as they become part of a standard code of conduct. Such contracts allow multiple parties to enter into contractual arrangements which seek to safeguard payments at each stage of the building or construction process. They bind the various parties&mdash;such as the owner or client, the head contractor and the subcontractor&mdash;to a scheme of payments whereby the head contractor's payments can be delivered where necessary to the unpaid subcontractor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of authorities have indicated that the use of standard building industry contracts can have two positive effects. Firstly, they can reduce individual hardship within the industry and, secondly, they can lead to significant cost savings. This is because tender prices could then more accurately reflect the true cost of construction because contractors and subcontractors would no longer have the need to build into their prices an unknown and sometimes excessive allowance for pricing risks beyond their control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To turn once again to the Security of Payments Industry Committee in New South Wales, the chairperson of that committee has estimated that the provision of a secure payments scheme within the industry should reduce construction costs by some 2.5 per cent. I commend this motion to the House. I again congratulate the honourable member for Dawson for bringing this important topic to the attention of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Small business is the backbone of Australia. Along with the farmers, it is the essential spine of our economy. The building subcontractors are an important part of that. It is very easy for small business to go broke, particularly in these current economic conditions. If you happen to be a building subcontractor and you are faced with the enormous fluctuations in the building construction industry, it makes it easier to go bankrupt. If you get caught up with a major contractor who duds you, takes all the money out of the project and then does not pay the subbies, then you are on the slippery road to ruin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) made brief mention of the code of best practices, and I commend him for that. It is a very nice idea, but the reality is that all the codes under the sun are still just idle rhetoric. We need legislation that encapsulates the motion moved by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). I commend the member for Dawson and the other speakers in the debate for their contributions. For one moment I felt slightly excluded as all speakers are members of the Joint Committee on Public Works, but let me assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the people of Australia that great numbers of members and senators in this place are concerned about subcontractors and the tremendous job that they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of many examples of problems for subcontractors in my electorate. Opal Cove is a wonderful resort which is functioning perfectly, but during construction the builders went bankrupt, broke, disappeared or whatever&mdash;I forget the exact circumstances&mdash;and dozens of hard-working, responsible subcontractors were not paid and went broke. Every member in this House can advance similar examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time has come when this must stop. I welcome the motion because the member for Dawson encapsulates everything that needs to be done. I particularly note that he recommends to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) that he take necessary action to protect subcontractors on all federal contracts. The minister is originally from my electorate&mdash;he is a Sawtell boy&mdash;and I am sure he will take note of the recommendations contained within the motion. I hope he does because this matter is vitally important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can give the House two examples. A concreter was not paid $60,000 and went down the drain. A subcontractor involved with airconditioning was not paid $60,000 and he also went broke. Labourers, tradesmen and members of parliament do their work and get paid, but subcontractors have to spend money to be able to perform the work. In many cases they have to outlay tens of thousands of dollars. When they do not get paid they go down the drain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I conducted a small survey of some of the solicitors in my area to see how many cases of non-payment of subcontractors they have pending. One solicitor currently has three cases and others have had dozens of cases over the years. I have just been handed a note which indicates that one subcontractor lost $70,000. Another lost $30,000 for the roundabout at Port Macquarie&mdash;in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile. Some builders lost $12,000 in another instance, another lost $15,000 at Bonville and another contractor lost $13,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must provide additional assistance for subcontractors. Many subcontractors start work on the basis of an oral agreement, but when the contract comes along six months later it bears no relationship to what was actually said. The Commonwealth should take the lead and ensure that when we award a contract we do not merely do it on the basis of price, because all too often in tough economic times people will cut their quotes to the bone to try to survive and as a result they are bound to go broke. As a Commonwealth, we should set the example and only award contracts where they are viable. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I thank them most sincerely for bringing to the parliament what I believe is not only a recognised problem but also an indication that on bipartisan lines we can do something about it if we have the will. We have demonstrated the inherent problems; I think they are common to us all as we go about our electorates. It also demonstrates a genuine desire for a bipartisan solution to this problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys) mentioned the 20- or 30-year-old problem of a preferred payment within six months of the time of a bankruptcy and that that has not yet been corrected. Thirty years down the track we can still find a subcontractor receiving a progress payment which he is fully entitled to and the main builder goes broke, so there is a preferential payment involved which then goes back. Also, in this debate it has been mentioned that direct wages, paid by a person who is subject to a bankruptcy order or is in liquidation, are protected if they are unpaid. But, if it happens that a subcontractor is paid those wages, and if it is in the form of a payment due to him, there is no suggestion of protection there. I believe that this is the essence of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The setting up of individual trusts for each individual contract has been suggested. I am led to believe that would be almost unworkable from the point of view of the accounting that would have to be done and also to conform with the trust act. It has come to my notice that a trust which is in the same form as a trust for employees' tax deductions&mdash;in the form of group payments&mdash;is the solution. So the tax office, in the case of a liquidation, has a preferential claim to that amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A suggestion has been made in this debate that, in the event of a liquidation, where a contractor has been paid but has not paid the subcontractors or paid for materials and other items, a trust should be formed in exactly the same way as a preferential trust. I cannot, and I do not think my colleagues can, provide an immediate answer, but we hope that those people who are interested, those people who have practical experience in the finance and building industries, and also the legislators, can get together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is heartening that the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Frank Walker, has acknowledged the problem and is prepared to take it before a ministerial council. It is also heartening to realise that throughout Australia there are various groups which are prepared to look at it. For instance, the Construction Industry Development Agency has suggested lots of ways in which there can be security of payment which is linked to making sure the proper financial arrangements are made at the outset and, secondly, that preferred contractors are on a preselection list so that those people who have the ability to do a job&mdash;not the $2 companies as mentioned by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), but people who have the ability to do it right down to the subcontractor level&mdash;are screened. It is then necessary to ensure that those moneys are in the control of a person&mdash;whether it be a banker or a financier&mdash;or a building society so that when the payment is made the trust arrangements apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So if $10,000 is paid to a subcontractor who is entitled to $2,000, and there is $8,000 for other subbies, that $8,000 must be treated in a trust-like manner. In that way we have security of finance&mdash;something that is not always available today. Lots of people recklessly go into a program without adopting a proper contract between the two parties. In fact, I have known cases where, upon getting a contract, the first thing a contractor will do is employ a solicitor so that they can look for the extras and the gaps in the program. If only governments were able to legislate to make sure there is a standard contract which is not subject to the alterations which are so often the case today. That is the security of payment. This body is also security for payment. If there are disputes between one and the other, there can be dispute negotiations and these can be adjusted quite simply on the site. The money is there; it can flow through. In a trust arrangement, in the event of a liquidation, those moneys have to be accounted for, as do so many others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope this is not the last debate here on this matter. I hope we have been able to use this as a catalyst to make sure the state authorities, in conjunction with the Commonwealth, can make these legislative procedures available&mdash;a code of conduct not written into legislation, but something that is recognised that builds on the registrations that take place. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House expresses concern about the exemptions and privileges now enjoyed by telecommunications carriers and calls on the Government to make the erection of mobile phone base stations subject to the consent of local councils.</PARA>
<PARA>I say to everyone living in suburban Australia, `Whether you like it or not, there is now a mobile phone tower near you.' This is the downside of the mobile phone revolution&mdash;an ugly thicket of poles and wires, a whole series of electronic pogo sticks which now blight Australia's suburban streetscapes. Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, it will get worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By conservative estimates, the numbers of mobile phones are supposed to double before the year 2000, and the move from analog to digital mobile phones will halve the radius of the existing mobile phone base stations. That means that, instead of the existing 2,000 mobile phone towers and aerial arrays, we will have 10,000 or more of these things sprouting like toadstools all over suburban Australia before the year 2000. I support the spread of mobile phones, but I think it should be driven more by community imperatives and less by commercial imperatives. Certainly, this system should not be driven by the fantasies of engineers who have discovered yet another new toy to play with. As I said, I have no objection to the spread of mobile phones, but I believe these companies have to be made more accountable to the community which they are supposed to serve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, if you or I want to build a flagpole in our backyards, we need to get permission from the local council. However, these telecommunications companies&mdash;Telstra, Optus and Vodafone&mdash;can put up a 30-metre high aerial virtually wherever they want. You and I have to ask the council for permission; Telstra, Vodafone and Optus simply have to tell the council that that is what they are going to do. This whole process of telling the council&mdash;not asking its permission&mdash;amounts to a fig leaf of consultation, masking the reality of untrammelled corporate power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the government's existing rules, councils have 30 days to object to any proposal to put up a mobile phone tower. Anyone who has dealt with government realises that it takes 30 days for most government departments simply to open their mail. The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) typically takes up to six months to answer his correspondence. The minister does not answer his questions on notice within 90 days, let alone 30 days. For two months the minister has had a petition signed by 528 residents of my electorate protesting against a mobile phone installation in Harbord. He has not returned it to me, nor to the state member who sent it to him and he has not tabled it in this parliament, even though according to members opposite not to table a petition&mdash;at least in the case of John Halden and Carmen Lawrence&mdash;is a contempt of parliament. This whole idea that the rules are adequate because councils have 30 days in which to object is just nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, under the existing rules, the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories is to investigate. We have 2,000 mobile phone towers and aerials in this country. Of those 2,000, after objections, just two have been altered. That is a paltry rate of change. What it shows is that the existing system is a watchdog that does not even bark, let alone bite. I will give some practical examples. In one case, local councils sent out letters to residents two days before a 30-metre high tower was to be built on the roof of a private hospital. In another case, work had actually commenced on a mobile phone base station before local residents were even aware. In the case of the Harbord kindergarten Telstra mobile phone base station, which turned the issue from a local problem into a national issue, the council objected&mdash;and it did so with the support of Labor Senator Belinda Neal. Public meetings were held, in which a Telstra technical expert allegedly said that he would not like his kids going to school in the shadow of one of these installations. The Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories duly objected. Then Telstra wrote back and said that there was no alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department meekly rolled over, told Telstra to scratch its tummy and said, `You can go ahead.' It did not give any reasons. It did not seek any alternative sites. It did not look into the possibility of co-location. It did not seek confirmation of Telstra's claims in its letter. What is more, there is no evidence whatsoever that the department has done what it had said Telstra must do, namely, provide evidence of community consultation after the installation had gone ahead. Yet, notwithstanding all these grievous inadequacies, Austel, which is supposed to be the overarching regulator, said that Telstra has gone exactly by the book. That is proof that the book is wrong in the case of the regulation of these mobile phone towers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems of these towers do not just concern my electorate. They are nationwide. The mothers of the Harbord community kindergarten have been contacted by other people who are objecting to installations in Northbridge, Asquith, Forbes in country New South Wales, and in Miranda. The representatives of 13 different groups are fighting 13 separate installations in Adelaide, in Woodford, Chapel Hill in Queensland, Mount Kuring-Gai and Baulkham Hills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported that at least three councils&mdash;Pittwater, Shellharbour and Kiama&mdash;are fighting similar plans while Marrickville and Canterbury residents are opposing towers near their homes. People all around Australia are complaining about this threat to their backyards. These people are not latter-day Luddites; they are ordinary Australians who want to control their own backyards and who want to take control of their own neighbourhoods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are asking a very simple question: why is the  telecommunications industry so different? What is so special about phone companies that means they can ignore the rules that everyone else has to obey? What is wrong with the telecommunications industry? What health risks, for instance, do these installations pose that lead these companies doing this work by stealth in the dead of the night whereas everyone else must ask permission from the council if they want to do anything, even to erect a flagpole?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that we have been living with microwave ovens and electrical devices for a long time, apparently with no ill effect, but I also accept that we were living with asbestos and X-rays for a long time before we realised exactly what the health risks were. It is important to point out to the House that it is understandable that people should be worried about this industry when, for instance, Telstra received a letter from the CSIRO saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is inappropriate to make sound scientific judgments on safety thresholds. There are certain inadequacies in the international standards and CSIRO has commented on that issue.</PARA>
<PARA>The very same letter criticised the Australian Radiation Laboratory's report, on which basis Telstra said that this installation in Harbord was perfectly safe. Then we had another letter from the CSIRO to the parents of Harbord, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We concluded that there was insufficient scientific evidence at the time to make any sound scientific judgement about safety thresholds.</PARA>
<PARA>So there we have it. The experts are not prepared to back the standards on which these things are proliferating all over suburban Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one way to make these things acceptable, and that is to get these phone companies to sit down and to talk to the people, to the neighbours of these installations. The only way for that to happen is to say to these phone companies that you cannot install a mobile phone tower without first going to the council and getting permission from the council in the same way that everyone else does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These concerns are not simply mine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) also shares a grave concern about these towers. I know I have only five minutes to speak, so I will quickly go through some of the major points in the speech I wanted to make. I received some letters just last week in regard to this situation, all from people in my electorate, about another tower that is going to be built&mdash;at Pearcedale. The tower is to be built just across the road from my electorate and the residents have raised various concerns.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other night during the adjournment debate, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) came into the chamber after a speech by the previous speaker. The minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point I make is simply this: yes, there are some people who do not like a mobile telephone tower to be constructed near their home. Everyone likes to protect the value of their property. A lot of people think that nothing should ever be built in their own backyard.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree that everyone likes to look after the value of their property. The trouble is that when these towers go up, you will find your property value goes down. And it will go down by 25 per cent, I have been told&mdash;if you can sell your house&mdash;at the base of one of these. Why would your property value go down? You have your mobile telephone tower handy. You can just go out in the backyard and you have good reception. The value will go down because of the perceived problems with these towers. Maybe there are health problems; the jury is still out on that. As the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) said, asbestos at one stage was the in thing&mdash;but look at the problems with asbestos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that the value of your home goes down. We have only to look at some of our valuable community buildings that have been defaced by these transmitters that are put on top of them. The value of those buildings has gone down. The value of living in the community has gone down because of these towers that are being erected all over the place. We must fight this trend&mdash;and stop it. What I have been advocating&mdash;I said it in a 90-second speech&mdash;is a moratorium on these towers. I believe that to be correct. There are many instances, which I will relate to the House at a future time, where companies are setting up now to provide satellite communications. We do not need these towers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are these towers going to be obsolete in 1997? It appears to me to be so. Satellites are being put up around the world to set up a communications system that we can use. What is going to happen to the Optuses of this world? Vodafone already has a bit of a financial problem. One newspaper is headed `Vodafone gushes red ink in cutthroat market', and states that Australia's third mobile telephone carrier, Vodafone, has made a loss of $45.4 million. It made this loss just this year. What happens if it goes bust when all the satellites go up? Who is going to pull down all the towers? It will be you and me, the taxpayers, who will pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all these companies should be putting some money into a trust fund to pay&mdash;if one of the companies goes bust&mdash;for the removal of these daleks that are being set up all over the place. As sure as eggs, one of them will go bust. There is not enough room for all these players, especially with the satellites coming on; there will be a lot of competition. There are the Bill Gateses of this world. Gates set up Microsoft and is going to have his own satellite communications system. Motorola is going to set one up. Teledesic, a Gates company, is going to be set up for satellite communication. They will all be competing for that one phone call&mdash;and the business will be very cutthroat. So there will be concrete and steel towers spread all over the countryside, with no-one owning them or having the responsibility for taking them down when they are old technology. This is not a long way off; it will happen very soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another item that I have noticed in relation to mobile phones is that people with hearing aids have a problem. Those people hear a clicking; they are affected by the digital transmission tower. Hundreds of thousands of Australians have hearing aids, and they are all affected by this. The health effects of exposure to electromagnetic radiation remain unknown. I have articles from paper after paper on this, discussing mobile phones and health. The articles are looking into the problems that may be caused by mobile phone transmissions. The jury is still out on whether they are dangerous. I urge people who use mobile phones to use them with caution. Be careful, because the radiation from a mobile phone near your ear does not go just one way; it spreads around and 50 per cent of it goes into the soft tissue of your brain. This is a danger we should be aware of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose of all the difficulties that a couple face as a result of the breakdown of a marriage, separation and divorce the issue of the best arrangements for the care of children is of greatest importance. While, obviously, the partners may no longer be married upon a relationship breaking down or a marriage failing, they are still parents. Our law recognises the ongoing role that both parents have to provide for not only the financial maintenance of children but also the children's ongoing development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest problem arises&mdash;which members will be well aware of&mdash;in circumstances where there is great conflict between the parties regarding children or where there has been a history of violence within families. Often circumstances where there is violence between one party to the other may lead to the violent party not being able to gain access to the children of the marriage, notwithstanding that there is no violence directed towards the children. In many circumstances, that is an appropriate outcome given that it is in the best interests of the child that there be no contact with the violent party. But there are other circumstances where, if appropriate facilities were available, there could be a handover point for access visits or where supervised access by the non-custodial parent to the children could take place. That is very much to be encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the government's Justice Statement, announced earlier this year by the Prime Minister, some $5.3 million was allocated over the next four years for the piloting of access handover centres in each of the Australian states. The purpose of these centres will be to allow access to occur in circumstances where there does need to be supervision or a settled place either for the welfare of the children or where a handover can occur due to the safety considerations for one of the parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, we have already advertised submissions of interest for the establishment of these centres. There has been very strong support throughout the country, and my department is now in the process of assessing the applications. Very strong consultation has been taking place with the Family Court and with other interested groups, such as the Australian and New Zealand Access Association. The aim of this consultation is to make sure that the people running these centres and their staff are appropriately trained and that staff will make sure that the children's welfare is closely considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end result should see progressively during the first half of next year the services established in each state. If they are successful, as I am sure the House would hope they are, they may well provide us with a model to extend these services throughout the community. I think this will go a long way to enabling another difficult element of separation to be handled in a sensitive way to make sure that we have high regard for the best interests of our children and at the same time recognise the ongoing responsibility of parents to have contact and involvement in the development of their children, notwithstanding that a marriage may have broken down.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see a number of articles in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> arguing that government social policies were contributing to the breakdown of families. The main article in that set of articles, which was reprinted from the British magazine the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>, was talking about concerns predominantly in the US and UK with declines in families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just returned from the United States and there is quite a debate going on over there about what they term welfare reform. When they use the term welfare they are primarily talking about the AFDC&mdash;aid for families with dependent children&mdash;which is broadly equivalent to our sole parent pension. The argument was that the existence of this payment was contributing to the perpetuation of a state of welfare dependency and intergenerational transmission of that welfare dependency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever one may say about developments in the US, to suggest that those trends are in any sense indicative of what is happening here or what the impact of social policy is here is completely wrong and demonstrably inaccurate. To take a few basic statistics, part of the conventional wisdom about this issue is that sole parent pensions are inducing young women and teenagers to go out and have babies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the facts of the matter? In Australia around one per cent of sole parent pensioners are under the age of 18 and teenagers make up around three per cent of the sole parent pensioner population. In the United States, the equivalent figure relating to AFDC is around eight per cent. In the United States, between 1979 and 1991 that proportion rose from four per cent to eight per cent&mdash;that is, the proportion of AFDC recipients who are teenagers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country the trend is the direct opposite. In 1976, teenagers made up 11 per cent of the equivalent of sole parent pensioners. They now constitute three per cent. In other words, not only is the situation quite different but the trends are fundamentally different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those social commentators who try to argue that we are heading down some route to disaster with the breakup of families and the perpetuation of welfare dependency are dead wrong. The median duration on the sole parent pension in this country is two years, which is very different from the situation in the United States. We have had demonstrably successful programs, through the jobs, education and training program, to get sole parent pensioners earning an income. The proportion earning an income has increased significantly and continuously over the last few years&mdash;again, a contrast with the situation in some of these other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole horror scenario that has been concocted about the way in which the existence of social security payments is leading to family breakdown and the proliferation of teenage pregnancy and so on is wrong. I could give a few other statistics that relate to the rates of family breakdown and divorce. In the United States, where benefits equivalent to ours are significantly less generous, the divorce rate is 90 per cent higher. In this country, after the passage of the Family Law Act, there was an increase in divorce rates from 1975 to 1983, but from 1983 to 1993 the rate has declined significantly: not only has it declined significantly, but the proportion of divorces involving children has declined from 63 per cent to 53 per cent. In the United Kingdom over the comparable period the divorce rate increased by 16 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on. It is both fake and wrong and absolutely absurd to suggest that having an adequate social safety net to protect people who need assistance from government in order to be able to look after their children in some appropriate state is the cause of family breakdown.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I know there has been some publicity given lately to the fact that there are shortages of obstetricians around the country, particularly in the country areas. I was very interested in this study which confirms a lot of international research. It shows very clearly that a team of midwives conducting deliveries actually has a somewhat superior outcome to the case where you have doctors and midwives together, and it compared both high-risk and low-risk women. Mothers and babies indeed had fewer adverse outcomes under the care of midwives, babies were less likely to be induced, and mothers were less likely to be administered the pain-killing drug pethidine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, from the government's point of view it is a lower cost option but, more importantly, it is more satisfying for the parents. So you do not get a poorer outcome. Indeed, you get a better one with fewer applications. Because of that, some time ago we established the alternative birthing services program to provide incentives to the states to enable women to have precisely that choice. A lot of women do want midwives. They want home deliveries, they want alternative birthing services, and they have spoken very clearly to us to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of birthing centres have been established around the country with Commonwealth funding, recognising that birthing is a normal event which does not necessarily require a lot of medical intervention. Indeed, the best in the profession will tell you precisely that. Unfortunately, some states have not cooperated. My own state, in particular, has failed to recommend projects which we could fund under the program. The result is that women in Western Australia do not have as much choice in having a midwife sponsored birth. Indeed, women in Western Australia do not have the same choices across a range of areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that in both Western Australia and the ACT it is quite probable that the reasons the state and territory governments have not come forward with programs is that of opposition within the medical profession. That is very disappointing when, at the same time, they are asking for greater funds from taxpayers and for more of their number to be trained. Of course, not all women want midwifery care; they want doctors. But others have the opportunity to have midwifery care in every state but Western Australia and the ACT. I would certainly urge those governments to undertake those programs right now to give Australian women the choice.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member. The first thing I would say that is important in this regard is that we have recognised that legal aid has not been adequately funded. The Justice Statement announced by the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and me in Brisbane some months ago did significantly increase the amount of money provided to legal aid, particularly in key areas which have not been adequately addressed, that is, in civil and family law matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that we can address these issues simply on the basis of putting additional funding into legal aid, recognising the ancillary provision of legal aid through community legal centres&mdash;this has been addressed in funding terms; in fact, we have doubled the amount of money going into community legal centres around Australia as a result of the Justice Statement strategy&mdash;is not going to be an adequate answer. That is because we have to look at prevention programs. The Attorney has talked about a number of programs that are designed to build a focus around prevention and trying to avoid litigation&mdash;to keep that as a matter of last resort&mdash;and also at ways in which we can get the system to operate more efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that regard, legal aid needs attention. The Sackville report, which was the initiative or springboard for the Justice Statement, did provide us with a clear indication that the Commonwealth needs to take greater national leadership, not so much to operate without regard for the interests of the states or legal aid commissions, but to work with them in partnership, with close attention to getting best practice and more effective outcomes from the delivery of legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A big step was taken towards that outcome last week when I announced the appointment of John King, who is a former secretary of the Attorney-General's Department in Victoria and currently is the head of the Victorian Port of Melbourne Authority. He has strong business credentials, very good and effective business management skills and will become the head of the Australian Legal Assistance Board, which will be my principal adviser in this area. I am hopeful that John King will be working closely with the commissions, principally with the four largest commissions, so we can go about targeting the scarce resources available to legal aid, to get the biggest bang possible for the buck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure it is a matter of great interest to both sides of this House that there are real needs for us to take a national approach to legal aid. There are a number of decisions, not least the Dietrich decision by the High Court and, more recently, the Milat judgment in New South Wales, which have implications with funding consequences for legal aid commissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the next meeting of the Standing Committees of Attorneys-General in Adelaide, the Attorney-General and I will be taking a paper forward for further discussion on how the states and the Commonwealth might respond to the implications of the Dietrich decision. It will also build in some reflection on the Milat judgment which, whilst under appeal, if confirmed would have a further implication in terms of the consequence. The implications of the Milat decision would be that courts might look behind the rates of scale payments that legal aid commissions have provided and order higher provision of legal assistance to counsel than commissions have budgeted for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, would have cost flow-ons to states and the Commonwealth in an area where there is, I think, little likelihood that there is a capacity to provide additional funding. That would put greater pressure on those legal aid dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are looking at those issues. I have indicated publicly that the Commonwealth is concerned about the Milat judgment. We have indicated to New South Wales that if it wants our assistance in the appeal we would be happy to intervene but to date New South Wales has said that no, it does not regard that as necessary; the arguments are proceeding well and it thinks it can carry them without our intervention. But if the matter does ultimately come before the High Court we will be ready to intervene in that matter, for obvious reasons.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. The government has allocated $6.4 million over four years to financial counselling services, also as part of the Justice Statement. This money will be for new services and to increase resources amongst the 30 services that the Commonwealth already funds. A great demand for increased staff for financial services exists across the country because of the great complexity and variety of choice of financial products. A lot of people are finding difficulties. So the bureau and I have liaised with the Australian Financial Counselling and Credit Reform Association to determine where the greatest need exists for the new services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now proposed 17 locations for new services, four in Queensland, four in New South Wales, three in Victoria, two each in South Australia and Western Australia, and one each for Tasmania and the Northern Territory. We will be placing advertisements&mdash;most have already gone in&mdash;calling for expressions of interest for agencies to operate services in the variation locations. In Queensland these will be Gympie, Roma, Logan City and Cairns. In New South Wales they will be in Bourke, Dubbo, Liverpool and Sutherland. In Victoria they will be in the Dandenong-Pakenham area, in the Eltham area and in Footscray. Meekatharra and the Perth northern suburbs will get the new services in Western Australia and there will be new services in Katherine in the Northern Territory and Launceston in Tasmania. In South Australia the new services will be in the Elizabeth area and in Coober Pedy&mdash;exactly where the need is. Five of these will be designed specifically to meet the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who have very special problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was recently in Alice Springs where our financial counsellor there recently got the Advance Australia award for his efforts.

So I commend to honourable members the allocation of those new services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have received a submission on behalf of the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, AMEC, proposing that exploration leases or licences be excluded from the native title legislation. I believe that the association has also released publicly a discussion paper to that end. The background of this particular matter is on the supposition that native title issues and the native title legislation are hindering in some way mineral exploration in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note as a starting point that the Australian Bureau of Statistics last week released figures for the 1993-94 financial year regarding mineral exploration in Australia. It indicated that exploration in that financial year had in fact increased over the previous financial year by some 12.7 per cent and reached a total of $893 million. Interestingly, the largest increases were in the states of Western Australia and Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, I take the point which the Minerals Council raised. The government has always contended, in relation to its response to the Mabo High Court decision, that we were required to balance the interest of a decent outcome for Aboriginal and Islander people with the need to ensure certainty of title and a backdrop where worthwhile economic activity was able to continue. To that end, the legislation itself already includes within its provision the capacity for low impact exploration to be excluded. It also allows the capacity for state governments to incorporate native title principles into their land management system and to establish state bodies to enable the processing of mineral and other interest in lands together with questions of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has been speaking to all of the Australian states on this issue.

These are matters which will be processed in accordance with the scheme laid out in the native title legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has had the least amount of progress in the state of Western Australia. That is not surprising, given the very strong line which the Western Australian government up until recent times has taken in response to the Mabo High Court decision. Of course, in the first instance we had the Western Australian government proposing its own legislation which effectively led to the extinguishment of native title in that state. That legislation was thrown out earlier this year by the High Court because it was held to be constitutionally invalid. Since then, the Commonwealth has gone to the Western Australian government and made it clear that the time has long now passed for political rhetoric, posturing and point scoring in relation to native title issues and that it was time for constructive discussions between the Commonwealth, the Western Australian government and economic and Aboriginal and Islander interests in that state so we could come up with a decent outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, I have spent a fair amount of time in various regions of Western Australia. I have spoken to a number of mining interests, a number of different native title claimants and representative groups of Aboriginal people as well as local government and other business interests in the state. I find there is a very strong willingness on behalf of all those parties to come together for a constructive approach towards advancing the position in Western Australia. If there is still reluctance in Western Australia, if there is still resistance in Western Australia, it rests largely on behalf of the Western Australian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now time for Premier Court to put his mind to constructive things such as dealing in a proper way with native title issues rather than pursuing political vendettas&mdash;as he is in the Marks royal commission. It is now time for the Premier and the government of Western Australia to engage the Commonwealth constructively in this issue and, just as importantly&mdash;in fact, more importantly&mdash;also engage the other stakeholders, particularly Aboriginal people, in debate so we can have a situation where we have proper processes recognised in Western Australia and a backdrop of which the mining industry as well as Aboriginal people can be confident that their interests will be safeguarded.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on Wednesday 30 August 1995, of Dame Pattie Maie Menzies, places on record its appreciation of her long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to her family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>Dame Pattie Menzies played a very significant role in Australia's national life over a very long period of time. She will be long remembered for her dignity and her warmth and it is only fitting that we honour her today through this condolence motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Pattie Menzies was born in Alexandra, north-east of Melbourne, on 2 March 1899. She attended school in Melbourne, first at the Presbyterian Ladies College, East Melbourne, and then later at Fintona. She married Robert Menzies on 27 September 1920, in the year that he appeared before the High Court in the engineers case and at a time when he was making his reputation as a leading barrister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Pattie was not a person who set her mind on a career in public life&mdash;rather, she supported her husband's career. Throughout Sir Robert's life, she was his loyal and supportive partner&mdash;and during his tenures as Prime Minister in 1939-1941 and 1949-1966, she was very successful and popular in her own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Pattie was awarded the GBE in 1954 in recognition of years of incessant and unselfish performance of public duty, in hospital work, in visiting and addressing and encouraging many thousands of women in every state of Australia, including very remote areas, and in her distinguished representation of Australia on a number of occasions overseas. That was on many occasions overseas, as I said earlier, over a very extended period of time. After Sir Robert's death in 1978 Dame Pattie remained active in Australian public and political life, particularly through her association with the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Pattie lived a full life of 96 years&mdash;an extraordinarily long life&mdash;outliving her sons Kenneth and Ian who died in 1993 and 1974, which must have brought considerable sadness to her. For a parent to lose a child in that way and to basically outlive her children would have been a sad reflection, I am sure, for her. She is survived by her daughter Heather and her 10 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was a fine Australian and a very private person who led a very public life. This, of course, must have put enormous stresses and strains on her life and her personality over the years. Through all this she earned the deep affection of the Australian people. On behalf of the government and the Australian Labor Party, I extend to Dame Pattie's family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On  behalf of the Liberal and National parties, I would like to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the government for facilitating this condolence motion. I would like to briefly associate the coalition with what the Prime Minister has said. He has canvassed the broad details of a remarkable life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, to those on this side of the House, Dame Pattie Menzies was a very special symbolic figure. Dying at the age of 96, having been married to the longest serving Prime Minister in Australia's history, and having been the daughter of somebody who also served in politics, it can be said that her life encompassed, in a very direct way, most of the major events and the major periods that shaped and influenced the Australian nation. She was a remarkable, confident partner, wife and supporter of Sir Robert Menzies. On his retirement the former Prime Minister said that nobody could have had a more loyal, supportive and helpful companion through public life and the private side of it than he had in Dame Pattie. The contribution that she made as his wife to Australia is very well known and very well recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an occasion to reflect more upon her life and her role and the impression she made upon the many people she met and the many people whose lives she touched rather than upon the deeds and the contribution of her great husband to the welfare of the people of Australia. As a young person growing up in the Menzies era in Australia in the 1950s, I looked upon Dame Pattie Menzies as a figure of stability, of decency, of reassurance, of companionship, and of continuity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Robert Menzies and his wife represented to millions of Australians of that period the essence of what was stable, predictable, valuable, worth while and dignified in our national life. Not everybody would have agreed with everything that Dame Pattie Menzies believed in and stood for, and she would have understood and respected that more than, I think, some of her political opponents in the broadest sense might have given her credit for. But she maintained an impeccable courtesy and decency through all her years as the wife of the Prime Minister. She stood by her husband's side during the peaks and the troughs of his very turbulent, long and successful political career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Pattie was with him when he was cast out by his party in the 1940s, she stayed by his side during the process of building the Liberal Party, and she stood by his side when he returned to office in 1949 and was there through his long years in office. She made for herself a very happy, a very useful and an infectiously humorous life, despite a great deal of personal sadness in the years that followed Sir Robert's death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I personally only got to know her when she was approaching the age of 90. I have a number of very happy recollections. I can well remember her attending a Liberal Party dinner in Sydney, I think in May 1987. If my memory serves me correctly, relations were not the most tranquil inside the coalition at that particular time, and she was kind enough to hand me a small spanner at that dinner, exhorting me to retain it in my briefcase and to continue to work on the coalition problems. I reflect that perhaps I may have lost it in some papers for a year or two, but I think it is fair to say that I have relocated it, and it now occupies a very prominent place in the briefcase at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another very vivid recollection I and many others would have of Dame Pattie Menzies is of a quite remarkable dinner that was attended in her honour in Melbourne in February 1989 to mark her 90th birthday. It brought together an enormous assembly of people on the broad liberal side of politics. The only two speeches, apart from that of the chairman, were of the late Sir Paul Hasluck, who proposed her health on behalf of all the guests, and Dame Pattie herself. It was a quite remarkable response of hers at the age of 90&mdash;a 20-minute speech delivered without any notes, delivered with great verve, great wit, great recall and very great charm. To many people who looked upon her as a very distant and unknown figure, it was quite a remarkable evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister remarked, she was touched by a great deal of personal sadness. To lose two of your three children is a sadness that I do not think many parents could accommodate, and she handled that with her very stoic courage and great dignity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Pattie made an enormous contribution to the symbolic importance, as well as the real significance to the Liberal Party, of our 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994. To have had present at those celebrations the widow of the founder of the party, somebody who had been continuously associated with the party through its history, was a remarkable component of those celebrations, and I know that many of us marvelled at the tremendous energy that she displayed and her tremendous commitment in coming to so many of the party's important celebrations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us had the opportunity of attending the memorial service held at Scots Church in Melbourne. Many of us also had had the opportunity of attending that great funeral service in Marrickville for the late Fred Daly, and I reflected to myself, after Dame Pattie Menzies' memorial service, that in a sense both of them represented in their own distinctive ways the different tribal gatherings. The gathering at Fred Daly's funeral was a great Irish-Catholic-Labor tribal gathering, which has been such an integral and important part of the fabric of this nation, and the gathering at Scots Church represented in a very real sense a Melbourne-Scots-Presbyterian, with a heavy liberal streak, gathering of that particular tribe. Although the tribal demarcations between our political parties and our different cultural traditions have now become very blurred and are very different, I think both of those traditions have made an enormous, valuable and positive contribution to the broad fabric of the Australian way of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Pattie Menzies represented the values of millions of Australians, particularly the older generation. To say that not everybody would share all of those values or respect all of the traditions that she respected is not to deny the importance of those traditions and those values to a large segment of the Australian population. She represented the values of stability and continuity. She represented the values of service and commitment to country and commitment to family. They are values that I know are respected across the party lines in this country. She was a person of immense strength and personal charm. Her death, after such a very long, fruitful and enormously valuable life, although sad in itself is also a celebration of the capacity of individuals to touch many lives and to leave a power of good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To her daughter, Heather, to her son-in-law, Peter, and to their children, all of whom bulk very large in the regard and affections of many in the Liberal Party, I convey my sympathy. Those who heard Heather's marvellous and moving tribute to her mother, both at the service in Melbourne and at the service in Canberra, saw it and heard it for what it was&mdash;an eloquent commentary from a fine lady about a very  remarkable parent and an extremely fine Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party honours unreservedly the memory of Dame Pattie Menzies. Her death severs a final link with a generation of Australian political behaviour and certain aspects of the Australian way of life that perhaps will never be the same again. We thank her for her enormous contribution not only to her family but also to the nation. She has certainly contributed much, and she will be long remembered not only by members of the Liberal Party but also by millions of Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) regarding the death of Dame Pattie Menzies. My wife, Judy, and I had the privilege of attending a special dinner function at the monarchists league in Australia a little over a year ago, on Wednesday, 15 June 1994, in the magnificent setting of the state parliament house dining room in Sydney. We had the privilege of sitting alongside Dame Pattie Menzies. On that occasion, a long day and a long and late function at night, she was fitter and fresher than many of us at the table. Indeed, she regaled us with many anecdotes over her long and rich contribution to the political fabric  of this nation. Furthermore, she stood up and made a speech and showed that she was capable, cogent and cohesive at that very late stage in her life. It was an absolute delight that Dame Pattie, on a number of occasions, went out of her way to extend friendship to my wife, Judy, at a stage when Judy was first attending functions around Canberra and the capital cities. I was greatly helped and honoured by that, as I know Judy was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Pattie's upbringing was a very tough one. She lost her mother very early in life and had a pretty tough time of it family-wise around Alexandra, in central Victoria, and later in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. I am led to believe that the upbringing of a student at PLC is no bed of roses. It was very strict, but it allowed her to go to church each Sunday, look across the aisle and see the Menzies boys. She singled out one in particular&mdash;Robert Gordon Menzies&mdash;and spent some time being slightly distracted from the sermon. She subsequently got to know him, married him and made that huge contribution to Australian politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the leaders of my party, she knew most of them and knew them quite well. Over the 75 years the federal National Party has had nine leaders. She said to me on one of the last occasions that I spoke to her that she had argument with only one of them; the others she very much appreciated. There is no prize for guessing which one she disliked. It was, of course, Dr Earl Page and the reason related to the events of 1939 and 1940. She was very much a friend and a supporter, and she enjoyed a very extensive friendship with so many members of the parliamentary National Party present and past in a way which gave great cohesion to the coalition. I am very happy to join with the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister and others who are about to speak in extending sympathy to the Henderson family, the Menzies family, the Leckie family and their extended families regarding the loss of Dame Pattie Menzies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a privilege to attend Scots Church&mdash;on the corner of Russell and Collins streets&mdash;for that very special and very moving service and to hear not only the Hendersons' great contribution, which the Leader of the Opposition referred to, but also that of Reverend Fred McKay, also aged about 90. Fred, who knew the family so well&mdash;who in his own right has made such a huge contribution to the flying doctors service and many other aspects of Australian life&mdash;was so wonderful in his praise of Dame Pattie Menzies. I say to the Henderson, the Menzies and the Leckie families, `You have an absolute right to be proud of a very special person who was a privilege to know.' I extend my deepest sympathy to the families. </PARA>

She was a living link to the foundation of the Liberal Party, formed by her husband, whose term as Prime Minister of Australia will never be rivalled and whose pre-eminence will never be equalled. No-one was held in greater affection by the members of the Liberal Party than Dame Pattie. She was interested and involved in its activities to the end. Even though she never sought public office, she lived a very public life and was held in great esteem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the things that most people who knew Dame Pattie would comment on was her sense of humour, her grace and her excellent judgment of people. On the occasions that I spoke to her, she was always full of advice, with penetrating advice on the people of the Liberal Party and the people of politics generally. There was no sense at all that she had lost her interest in politics. She was deeply engaged. I found her to be absolutely astute. She also had a sense of relaxation that put others at ease. Those of us who were present at the 50th anniversary dinner for the Liberal Party in Melbourne will recall that she was to be presented with an award by the president, Tony Staley. She took one look at Tony Staley and decided that she was fitter and more active than he was, so she walked to him to collect the award rather than let him walk to her to present it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was devoted to her family. She undertook considerable activities in the field of aged care, particularly the Melbourne women's hospital, and at the children's hospital. She never made a show of her social work, but she used her understanding and practical knowledge for the good, including on many occasions influencing her husband with policy changes. She was made a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of her tireless work for hospitals and her incessant and unselfish performance of public duty, particularly her encouragement of Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She talked with women all over the country, in remote areas and in city locations, and encouraged them in her endeavours. She and Sir Robert were long-term residents in the Higgins electorate and, after Sir Robert's retirement, I came to represent her from 1990 onwards until she moved to Canberra. She believed passionately in the capacity of the individual. She championed freedom of speech, and she believed in the mutual support of family in the efforts that are bestowed upon all the family members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Pattie had a great sense of duty and service. No-one who met her would be in any doubt about her sense of fun and sense of humour.

To her remaining child, Heather Henderson, and Heather's husband, Peter, to their grandchildren, to the other grandchildren and great-nephews and grand-nieces, I extend my condolences. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My knowledge of and acquaintance with Dame Pattie goes back many years. Indeed, I am the only remaining member of this parliament who sat with the late Sir Robert Menzies in his cabinet. I well remember at the time I was appointed Minister for Social Services receiving quite considerable advice and guidance from Dame Pattie. She had very strong views, not only in her later years but in her earlier years, about the administration of social welfare in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remember quite personally the extraordinary sympathy she showed my family and me when my first wife, Margaret, died way back in December 1967. Dame Pattie was a wonderful wife, mother, grandmother and, more recently, great-grandmother. Above all, the life of Dame Pattie reflects something of the extraordinary contribution that wives and spouses can make to members and senators in this rather extraordinary life we live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the extraordinary parts of Dame Pattie's contribution was not only in her public performance but in her private influence. Indeed, when one looks at Canberra and sees something of the development of this place, I think it is wise to remember that the Lodge in those days&mdash;in a different day and age&mdash;was far more part of what was then essentially a relatively large country town. If issues came to pass which involved the development or the services of this city, in the days of the National Capital Development Commission, Dame Pattie's influence inevitably was reflected in Sir Robert's voice. His attitudes and patterns in this place certainly reflected very much her own view of how this place should grow and develop, and Canberra and Canberrans should recall with pleasure and pride the way in which she indirectly and sometimes directly contributed to its growth and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She also had very strong views on a range of issues. During those years when Sir Robert was Prime Minister, in good times and bad it was her guidance, advice and friendship as much as her love for him which I believe contributed significantly towards the efficacy of his term as Prime Minister of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw Dame Pattie again as a grandmother. My children attended school with Heather's children, and we saw each other at speech days and other functions.

She was a very kind and wonderful person in that sense, and I know how much Heather and her children will miss her.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of that lecture, I quoted a statement of Sir Robert's about the nature of political life, which seemed to strike a special chord with Dame Pattie. I might just repeat it here. Sir Robert made the statement in 1954 at the end of a dinner address. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Did anybody suppose . . . that a man like myself who loves the law, and the practice of the law, and the whole philosophy of the law, would go into this turbulent stream for a job? A job! Of course not!

<PARA>In the role that she performed so well, Dame Pattie embodied I believe that same philosophy. She exemplified the model of public service, about which Sir Robert spoke. She cared for the Liberal Party, but above all she cared for Australia and its future and she never tired of promoting this country and the values which she believed underpinned its success. These were pre-eminently values of personal responsibility, integrity, selflessness and public service.</PARA>

I sought to name that foundation after somebody whom I believed had given enormously, yet had not been recognised in her own right. So I went to Melbourne to seek the permission of Dame Pattie Menzies to name that foundation after her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After many discussions, we established the framework of the foundation. She agreed to give her name to it, and we drank a small toast to it at midday in sherry. Dame Pattie came to Sydney to launch that foundation. It was at the very dinner that John Howard referred to just a little while ago when he was presented with a screwdriver that she gave a speech of such force and such resilience as to spur the party on to ensure that the ideals in which she believed, as well as Sir Robert, were part and parcel of the ongoing Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we gathered together on her death, it was at a service of thanksgiving for her life. It was a period of joy. Others have mentioned the stories told by Heather Henderson of her mother&mdash;about how she cared about running a good house, telling her husband to walk on the side of the stairs so as not to wear out the carpet, making pillowslips out of old sheets; understanding that she was an ordinary woman but living an extraordinary life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Pattie was small in stature, yet she strode the international stage with confidence, with affection and, yes, at the side of our longest serving Prime Minister&mdash;but also in her own right on so many occasions.

Sir Isaac Isaacs, of course, was the first and her father, John Leckie, was the second. It was very interesting to hear her talk about her father's work as the state member for Benambra and as the federal member. He was the state member from 1913 to 1916 and then the federal member for Indi from 1917 to 1919. Afterwards, he became a senator.

She actually told me that her father used to say that for every pound that you spend on country people, you get two pounds back. For every pound you spend on city people, it costs you double.

But I was privileged to meet her twice in 1963. The reason I speak today is that she made such an indelible impression on me that I felt I should contribute to this condolence motion and put on the record, for those who did not have the privilege of ever meeting her, just what an extraordinary impression she made on people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1963, Robert Menzies, as he was then, and Dame Pattie as she was, visited Brisbane twice, in April and November, during an election campaign. When they arrived in the prime ministerial plane, the call went out to Young Liberals to go to the airport to meet them because most members of the party were at work. I was then the State Secretary of the Young Liberals and duly went out. The state director of the party, Charles Porter, thrust a bunch of flowers into my arms and said, `Please give these to Dame Pattie.' He introduced me to her and I did that. She chatted in a very animated way with the young people who were out there. Robert Menzies was not so interested in the young people&mdash;I am sure he had very important things on his mind&mdash;but I must admit I was impressed at the time with the time and trouble she took over us youngsters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November of that year, when the election had been announced, Robert Menzies came to Brisbane. There was a youth rally in the Brisbane City Hall. It was the first youth rally of any political campaign in Australia and the first release by any political party of any youth policy. Again, the powers that be in the Liberal Party decided that instead of having a lot of grey hair on the stage with Robert Menzies they wanted youth. The state executive of the Young Liberals were told they were to sit on the stage at the city hall&mdash;which we thought, of course, was a great honour. By then I was no longer state secretary; I was Vice-President of the Young Liberals. The point at which Dame Pattie really slew me was when we were being introduced to the Menzies in the foyer of the city hall. Charles Porter said to Dame Pattie, `I would like you to meet the Vice-President of the Young Liberals.' Before he had mentioned my name, she said, `Oh, I have met Miss Martin before.'</PARA>

Couldn't you think up some scheme under which the government could subsidise the building of proper accommodation?'

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Various amendments were made to the legislation as the result of a Senate enquiry. Submissions were received by many groups who would be affected by the Act including doctors, hospitals, consumer groups and health insurance funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes to private health insurance remove many of the restrictions previously placed on the private health insurance system and, unlike under managed care, the patient retains the choice of doctor and hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms create a more competitive industry and allow for greater choice of products for those who choose to supplement Medicare with private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Doctors may now choose to contract with health funds which allows the funds to provide cover to members for amounts in excess of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee. This will result in no, or a known level of, out-of-pocket expenses for the patient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no compulsion for doctors to contract with the funds. If a patient prefers a doctor who does not have a contract with their fund then the previous arrangement remains. That is, they will receive 100% of the MBS fee, 75% from Medicare and 25% from their insurance fund.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition relates to a request that the drug TAXOL (paclitaxel) be subsidised by the Federal Government under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) is the expert body that advises me which drugs and medicinal preparations may be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PSB).

An application to extend the use of TAXOL on the PBS for use as third line chemotherapy (that is after other treatment has failed) in advanced breast cancer was recently considered for a second time by the PBAC.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have learnt today that the World Bank has decided that Australians are worth $1 million a head. Most of this, we are told, is because of our pristine environment. There is one blot on this $1 million environment that every Australian enjoys, and that is the tangle of wires and poles which constitute the downside of the information superhighway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of our environment is improving today thanks to ever greater awareness and ever greater environmental sensitivity. We will not let logging companies denude hillsides purely for the sake of the dollar. We will not let industrial companies dump their garbage in rivers purely for the sake of the dollar and we will not let chemical companies spew their poisons into the atmosphere purely for the sake of the dollar, yet this government is letting telecommunications companies add to the visual clutter in our cities purely for the sake of the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I warn the government that Optus's decision to deliver pay TV by cable draped on power poles, which is now being followed by Telstra in an example of how competition can sometimes drive standards down, threatens that the information superhighway will end in a dead-end of an urban jungle of poles and wires. We have had no debate on the delivery of a pay TV service. Hardly anyone in the cities and towns of Australia is aware of the fact that Optus, and now Telstra, wants to deliver pay TV by the cheaper, nasty method of overhead cable. This is the biggest sneak attack since Pearl Harbour. It is an absolute outrage that this government is allowing these companies to get away with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that I am not against pay TV. I just think that pay TV, if delivered by cable, should be delivered by cable underground. It should be delivered by cables which enhance our life and do not detract from our life. We have more than enough clutter overhead. We have more than enough space junk in our cities already; we do not need any more to deliver us pay TV via cable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last month, Optus Vision wrote to Manly council in my electorate announcing that, in the terms of the various laws and regulations governing telecommunications, it proposed to roll out pay TV cable within six weeks. The council wrote back seeking further and better particulars. Optus wrote back one of those pro-forma fill-in-the-blanks letters that could have been written to any council in Australia. In fact, it gave no details whatsoever. Manly council is trying to formally object, under the provisions of the telecommunications code, to the roll-out of Optus Vision pay TV cable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that from these telecommunications companies there has been a most unfortunate lack of openness. For instance, I wrote to Telstra earlier this year seeking information on where Telstra would be trying to deliver pay TV via overhead cable. I got this response from Telstra:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposals for aerial street cabling are subject to notification and consultation obligations contained in the telecommunications national code.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what Telstra was saying was, `Don't you worry about overhead cabling, because it is all governed by the telecommunications national code.' Austel have recently written to the Kuringai council&mdash;this letter has been passed on to the Manly council&mdash;saying that this is not the case at all. In fact, Austel have said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where no agreement can be reached as regards construction of a tower or similar installation, Council is able to require the carrier to refer the issue to the Department.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Telstra was implying in their letter. However, Austel says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that provision does not apply where the proposed infrastructure relates to cable. In the latter circumstance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is to say, where the proposed infrastructure relates to cable&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the carrier is obliged to refer the issue to the Department only where the installation is, in the carrier's opinion,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.likely to give rise to an environmental objection . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.likely to raise substantial environmental concern within the community, and</PARA>
<PARA>this is significant&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the carrier agrees that the effect upon the environment will be or is likely to be significant.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have it. There is complete open slather for these companies to roll out cable absolutely anywhere they like, and the local councils cannot do anything about it. This is an absolute outrage. It shows that this system of rules that the government has in place is completely meaningless. It shows that Austel is a watchdog which does not even bark let alone bite. It shows the need for the government to get serious about telecommunications regulations straight away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Optus Vision have agreed to meet with local members of parliament plus Manly council on 3 October. But according to Austel, Optus Vision, or indeed Telstra, have the right to roll out cable whenever they like. I warn Optus Vision that, if they were to decide to do that before this meeting, they would be guilty of a very serious breach of faith with the Manly community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem is not, in the end, with Optus or with Telstra or with Austel; it is with the government. What the government should do is halt this roll-out of pay TV cable until some important questions are answered. Firstly, the possibility of co-location needs to be thoroughly investigated. Secondly, it needs to determine whether the government is prepared to allow two pay TV cables to be hung from the same sets of power poles, thus doubling the overhead clutter. We then need to work out when the electricity utilities plan to go underground with their wiring, if ever. Finally, what contribution are these telecommunications companies going to make to the cost of this? Only after these issues have been addressed can or should pay TV cable be rolled out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not against Optus; I want to make that clear. I believe that there should be a level playing field between Optus and Telstra. The fact is that Telstra have conduits under most suburban streets. Optus should be allowed free access to those conduits to put their pay TV cable there. Telstra claim that there is no room in their conduits. Quite frankly, Telstra's claim cannot be taken seriously. Telstra cannot be trusted on this matter any more, it seems, than the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) can be trusted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Telstra conduit is 50 millimetres. The sort of cable that both companies are running out at the moment is 17 millimetre cable. There is certainly room for two 17 millimetre cables in the existing Telstra conduit. I call upon the federal government to investigate this matter. If it is technically feasible, the federal government must direct Telstra to make their conduits available to Optus. The fact of the matter is that that conduit is not owned by Telstra, which is entirely funded by the taxpayer and owned by the federal government. That conduit is owned by the Australian taxpayer. It must be put to the use of the Australian taxpayer and not simply to the commercial interest of one company called Telstra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telstra has a very privileged position in our society. I think it had better be careful that it does not abuse it. We read in the paper this week that there are 103 executives in Telstra today who are earning more than $100,000 a year. There are 148 members of this parliament who earn less than that to run the country. There are eight Telstra executives who earn more than $500,000 a year. That is eight Telstra executives who earn more than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Telstra had better be pretty careful about the liberties and the licences they appear to be taking with the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> points out that residents objecting to a mobile phone tower could not proceed because the 12 law firms they approached&mdash;all 12 of them&mdash;are on Telstra's list to get briefs. So none of them would act. The fact is that the problem is not just with Manly council. North Sydney had a vote with the recent mayoral poll. Seventy per cent objected to overhead cabling. The Shoroc councils of the North Shore and the peninsula councils are all objecting to overhead cabling for pay TV. I put a question on notice about this issue. I think it is absolutely vital that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) does not neglect this question on notice like he has neglected all the others. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about a grievance today. That grievance is the disservice being done to Australia's youth by the federal opposition. We should not ignore the job that the opposition is doing on our youth. We have seen the job that it has done in talking down the economy, in talking up interest rates and in creating a lack of confidence in Australian families, who have now enjoyed 16 quarters of consecutive economic growth. By constant harping, the opposition has had a major effect on those families who do not enjoy the confidence that they should at this stage in our economic cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disservice being done to our youth is caused by the constant whingeing of the opposition in claiming that the government is not doing enough for the youth of today and the unemployed, particularly those who have little or no job skills. The opposition is always long on rhetoric but short on fact when it raises this argument. Selective memory is a wonderful thing. Members of the opposition are endowed with it in great abundance. They overlook the fact that more than 600,000 young Australians now attend our universities and that all undergraduate courses are HECS-liable, so they do not have up-front fees. They overlook the fact that the retention rate in high schools throughout Australia has escalated to record levels under this government. I can quote the figures because&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There you go again; you cannot resist the opportunity to let the young people know that the opposition wanted them to work for $3 an hour. That is what you wanted. The youth out there know that, if you strike it lucky and the press continues to support you at the next election, that is what you will be asking them to do. Apart from your industrial relations policy that you probably have tucked away somewhere that you got out of some medieval epistle, you will be asking them to work for a measly sum that will be less than unemployment benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition either does not know or is completely oblivious to the success rate of labour market programs. They rarely speak about the jobs that have been created in record numbers by the Keating government. This evening I would like to mention a particularly innovative project that the Hunter Valley Training Company has been involved in. Last Wednesday in Penrith yet another example of the government's commitment to finding jobs and reducing the level of unemployment was unveiled by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free). This was the skills express mobile training system. It comprises mobile classrooms fitted out with state-of-the-art computer equipment which is used for providing hands-on training for the unemployed in areas where access to such equipment is not normally available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This mobile training system was the brainchild of one of their staff. It comprises a couple of semitrailers, pantechnicon bodies, fitted out and fully airconditioned. These are available at short notice to go anywhere in the state of New South Wales. All they need is a power supply and they can provide immediate training facilities for people in the most remote parts of New South Wales. They are already booked for 200,000 training hours over the next three years. I am sure that the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) would be most interested because I know that in the next few weeks one of these will be going out to the coalmine at Ulan. While that may not be in his electorate, it is certainly getting fairly close to it. It will provide training for the people who work at the mine. This is the response of a government that places training above many things. Yet we see an opposition that continually tears away at the confidence of young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a teacher for 29 years in the secondary system in New South Wales. I know that one of the greatest things that we can give the youth of Australia is confidence&mdash;confidence that the skill and knowledge that we impart in the schools will be of use to them and will provide them with a job and a future career. That is why the constant harping from over there really does take effect with our youth. On the one hand, they can see the training that is being offered and the innovation that is appearing but, on the other hand, they hear members opposite constantly dragging at their confidence. They do not know which way to turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, these mobile classrooms will be able to take training to all parts of the state. It is named skills express, which is very suited. Three units have been set up at this stage. Two of them have multiple uses. They are mobile classrooms. As I said, they are fitted with computers. One of them is a specialist facility that has been set up as a workshop where hydraulics mechanics can be taught. Of course, the sky is the limit as far as the ability of these mobile rooms to impart knowledge and skills is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hunter Valley Training Company is a success in its own right. It was established in 1981 during depressed economic conditions. Of course, we can mention who the federal government was at that time. It was used to train 299 Bayswater power station apprentices. The opening date for Bayswater was delayed and the company had two options&mdash;to release the trained apprentices to become unemployed statistics or formulate an employment policy. It chose the latter. Fourteen years later, with a large degree of government assistance, its staff number over 1,000 and its training policies and techniques are high in demand throughout the Hunter region and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, I am sure that you are aware of the values of the Hunter Valley Training Company in your own area. It has the ability to place apprentices where that workplace environment is not immediately available. It has trained in excess of 3,000 young people in over 50 different trades. That is the beauty of such a training facility. I am very proud that it is an initiative and that it has received the continuous support of the government. This facility, combined with regional divisions in Maitland, Wollongong, Coffs Harbour, Sydney, Port Macquarie, Lismore, Tamworth and the Shoalhaven, is offering an enormous resource to the young people of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training methods include modular formats and skills audits. Hunter Valley Training Company personnel are considered to be the best in the industry. They have wide experience directly with hands-on skills in industry. Most of the trainers have come directly from industry and they know the skills that are needed. In 1990 the Hunter Valley Training Company branched out into training for industry and the public. They also host training for apprentices employed by other firms. The skills express is the latest project of the Hunter Valley Training Company. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The real reason that young people's confidence is being sapped is that, after 12 years of Labor, 28.3 per cent of them cannot get jobs. In my electorate the figure is 40 per cent. The real reason is that the overall policies of this federal government are discouraging young people. I wish that retention rates would continue to go up. I welcome the retention rates going up. The fact is that young people are now saying, `If I study hard, the fact is under this government I only end up on the dole queues anyway. I can't get a job.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I rise to make some comments about Australian families. The reason I rise to discuss this is that many people in the coalition are concerned about family life. Over the weekend an article appeared in the `Focus' section of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> entitled `The disappearing family'. Several articles looking at families, family values and so on have been appearing in newspapers around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that today in the parliament a dorothy dixer was put to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), through which the minister wanted to defend the government's social welfare policies. No doubt the minister was stunned by what was written by people in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>. The commentary which accompanies the article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social engineering in Australia is a mishmash, with conflicting goals, muddy rationales and perverse outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the social system does not reward or encourage marriage, sometimes undermines the nuclear family, and often erodes the work ethic and keeps people on welfare.</PARA>
<PARA>I guess the minister was really stunned by the fact that the system is now being criticised by various people in the media. It is no wonder that the minister is getting up in the House defending its social security policy and families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting point about the article, which was under the heading `The disappearing family', is that the family which it talks about is not actually disappearing. While you find some commentators saying that the family is disappearing, it is interesting to look into the figures to find out exactly what they mean. The commentators talk about the normal family, the traditional family or the nuclear family. However, when you pin it down to a definition, they are actually talking about the normal or traditional family as being married people with two children. Now that is about 15 to 20 per cent of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commentators do not regard the traditional normal family as a couple with no children. They do not regard a married couple with one child as being traditional or normal. They do not regard a married couple with three children as being normal or traditional. They do not regard a married couple with four or more children as being normal or traditional. They do not regard a married couple whose children have grown up and left home as being normal or traditional. They do not regard brothers and sisters living together&mdash;they may not have married&mdash;as being the normal or traditional family. If you have your grandparents living with you, you are not a normal, traditional or nuclear family. And so it goes on. This is just an absolute nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another very interesting factor is that, even though we hear about the high divorce rates&mdash;which probably is true, depending on your view of these matters; it certainly has increased in Australia&mdash;the fact is that 83 per cent of all first marriages are still intact in Australia. Eighty-three per cent really is a very high figure. In many respects I think we can dispel the idea that people are giving up living in family structures, because they are not. They are continuing to live in those structures although there may be fracturing at the edges of it. Certainly, there has been an increase in single parent families and so on&mdash;we know the hardships which they go through&mdash;but the debate is really about whether public policy in this country should encourage families, marriage and stable relationships. I believe it should because marriage is very important to the nurturing processes of our young people. I believe that if you have strong families, you have a strong nation; if you have weak families, you are going to have a nation which is also weak. The feature article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compared with 30 years ago, it is easier for women to raise children without men, and for men to escape the burdens of fatherhood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The weakening of that link has hurt children. Multi-generational studies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is what is interesting&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in Sweden, Britain and America all seem to show that, compared with their peers of the same economic class, children in lone-parent families do less well in school, get into trouble more often and have more emotional and health problems. They are also more likely to become single parents themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>What is emerging from empirical evidence right around the world&mdash;it is not being said by members of the coalition or of the Labor Party&mdash;and what we have to address as a country is that children who are not nurtured in secure family situations with a male and a female role model for them are creating difficulties within the country. This is the concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can we as a nation try to put together policies which underpin family life and actually encourage family life more strongly than what we are doing today? I believe we can. It is interesting to point out that, on 22 August in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, we also had Bettina Arndt making the comment that the evidence suggests that a good divorce is not better for children than a bad marriage. Again, she is referring to the empirical evidence coming through from our universities, our social scientists and so on. We are now challenging the last 20 years of generally held views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that, in many respects, it is politically incorrect to argue this way in the parliament. But what is coming through from our social scientists in the United Kingdom, Europe, Canada and the United States&mdash;I have been to Israel and talked to people there as well&mdash;is that, as far as government policy is concerned, there has to be an underpinning of the importance of marriage and stability in that relationship if we are going to nurture our children and give them the best start in life. </PARA>

I do not have time to go through all of those studies. I will just give one example. In 1992 there was a study conducted of 409 young people in Western Australia's Longmore Remand and Detention Centre. It showed that only 19.6 per cent of those children lived with both parents and 75 per cent did not live with their fathers. The study showed that juvenile destructive behaviour was closely related to family experience. In other words, if we can hold our families together we are going to have less crime. Governments now must make sure that there is more money involved in parenting courses and marriage preparation courses. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Victorians continue to be burdened by a state Liberal government which now leads the list as the biggest taxing and the biggest spending state government in the Commonwealth. I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) on the manner in which he has exposed in this place the enormous burdens that the Kennett government has put on ordinary working families. The Kennett Liberal government is really one with a warped sense of priorities. It displays a great concern for waiting lists at gaming tables but it does not show much concern for the waiting lists of the sick in our hospitals, and in that I include the Geelong hospital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it slashes funding to kindergartens, it spends millions of dollars on consultants. While it slashes funding to hospitals, the Premier gallivants around the world like no other Premier in Victoria's postwar history. This Premier has been overseas once every three months since he came into power. That is more than any Premier in any Labor state government in the postwar period. The government over which he presides has spent more money on consultants in the last two years than any state Labor government since the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1992 we have observed some very disturbing features of the processes of government in the state of Victoria, and I want to pick up some of those issues in this grievance debate tonight. Since 1992 and the election of the Kennett Liberal government we have seen a massive assault on Victorian families. We have observed massive increases in taxes and charges, which have brought an additional burden to Victorian households of something in the region of $1,500. That particular burden has been matched by a reduction in essential services. Along with that, the industrial relations policy, which has been endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) here in this parliament, who is a great sympathiser of Jeff Kennett, has seen many working families have their wages and conditions slashed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More insidiously, there has been an introduction of a climate of fear and intimidation to workplaces in Victoria. The approach that has been taken at the federal level by the Labor Party in government contrasts very sharply with the intimidation, fear and confrontation which has accompanied the industrial relations system that has been introduced by the Kennett government. Perhaps even more insidiously, we have seen a massive assault on the rights and liberties of Victorians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in legislation financial disincentives for individuals to pursue their legitimate rights and claims under that legislation. We have seen a curtailment of widespread rights to appeal in Victorian legislation. I had a conversation with a member of the legal fraternity recently who came to me absolutely outraged. He was a rather conservative gentleman, quite upstanding in his local community, and he had a documented list of the legislation that had been passed by the Victorian parliament under the Kennett government which had made this massive assault on the liberties and the rights of Victorians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not end there. When we look at the processes of government in Victoria, the democratic structures that have been built up over time in this great state, we see the Kennett government has effectively removed a structure of government with municipal amalgamations with the appointments of commissars&mdash;commissioners, as they are called by the government, but by the people they are called commissars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a centralisation of power in Spring Street with the strata of democratically elected local government replaced by appointed commissioners beholden to the central government in Spring Street. This is one of the grossest violations of democratic processes and procedures in this country and in the history of federation. It probably rivals the notorious assaults on liberties that was introduced by the Bjelke-Petersen government in Queensland. But we have seen in Victoria the removal of a strata of government, a replacement of democratically elected representatives by commissioners beholden to the central government at Spring Street. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as working families are concerned, their living standards have been grossly assaulted by this government. It is estimated that Geelong families are now paying in the region of $1,500 in extra taxes and charges. Until recently, we had the $100 home tax that the Kennett government introduced. We have had an increase in the petrol levy of three per cent, in kindergarten fees, in gas costs, in electricity costs, in motor registration and insurance and the introduction of school fees at many state schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this assault on working families, we have seen the wages of some workers severely reduced because of the industrial relations policies of the government in Victoria. All this has meant that the income to businesses has declined as people have less to spend. Put on this the overlay of the advent of gambling in Geelong and in the state of Victoria, many small businesses now are feeling a real pinch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In going to specific areas and in looking at the Kennett government's record on education, we observe an increase in class sizes, poor school cleaning and maintenance, reduced access to integration programs, the closure of many schools, reduced careers counselling services and increased fees for parents. Among teachers there is poor morale. There has been a loss of remedial maths and English teachers and a reduction in student welfare counselling resources. The Kennett government's legacy to the people of Victoria has been a deliberate run-down of the educational infrastructure of the state, a teaching profession that is beset by reduced morale and students who are suffering reduced opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of health, I ought to impress upon this House the importance of the Geelong hospital as a regional service centre. It has been one of the most efficient hospitals in the state but Kennett cutbacks have put the financial viability of the hospital in jeopardy. Public confidence in the hospital recently was called into question with revelations of extreme financial difficulties at that institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 300 hospital jobs have been cut, the budget cuts have been in the order of 18 per cent to 23 per cent, and 50 beds have been closed. We have seen increases in waiting lists, early discharges of patients, linen and bedding shortages, poor staff morale, overworked staff with no end to their workload in sight, poor heating at the hospital and, of course, a commensurate increase in the number of voluntary workers who are being called in to assist the hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as rail transport is concerned, we are now beginning to reap the whirlwind of massive cutbacks in that state in the transport sector. As far as the port of Geelong is concerned, the Kennett government is hell-bent on selling the port of Geelong to private interests. This port has recently clocked up some very good profits. It has a high level of reserves. It is a community asset that ought to stay in public hands, but we all know that the ideologues at Spring Street are hell-bent on selling this very important community asset to the city. I could go on at length but there will be a day of reckoning in the Geelong region for this government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much has been said about the issue of youth unemployment in recent times. It is an issue of great concern to politicians on both sides of this House and one which all political leaders cannot choose to ignore or to hide. Today, I want to highlight the problems of youth unemployment in regional electorates like my own and to put forward some positive suggestions about the way in which it might be tackled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The August 1995 regional unemployment rate for teenagers&mdash;that is, 15- to 19-year-olds&mdash;in the Wide Bay-Burnett area of Queensland was 42.2 per cent. That takes in my home town of Bundaberg and the southern half of my electorate. At other times, it has been almost as high in the northern part. That means that more than one-third of the young people between the ages of 15 and 19 living in my electorate are looking for a job and cannot find one. This is well above the Queensland average of 20.6 per cent. As unpalatable as this figure might seem, it reflects the great difficulties being faced by young people living in regional Australia and trying to enter the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two weeks ago the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) was in Bundaberg selling the virtues of Working Nation. With a general unemployment rate of 14.9 per cent in the Wide Bay-Burnett region and 6,000 people in Bundaberg and a further 2,000 people in the Gladstone area receiving unemployment benefits, the minister was keen to talk up the job prospects and advantages of Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not inappropriate. I recognise it is the responsibility of the government of the day to provide unemployment and training programs. While I have reservations about some, I actively promote others. We must all promote and encourage opportunities for job growth and for skilling the Australian work force. The acid test of these programs is how many real and sustainable jobs exist at the end of the government subsidised period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the minister laid the challenge to create 5,000 new jobs in Bundaberg by the end of the year. It sounds a bit like an election promise, does it not? Nevertheless, I will be the first to congratulate the minister if this can be achieved. But to make this challenge cynically with an election in mind will carry with it its own rewards, especially in a region with high interstate migration and population growth, a major building industry and industry supply slump, a crippling drought and a parlous lack of government infrastructure spending in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the same day in my electorate, the employment minister opened the new premises of one of Australia's most progressive group training companies, BACAS. As a founding member of the board of that organisation, I well understand the importance of structured training and apprentices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent report on group training by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training described group training as one of Australia's best kept employment secrets. I for one believe the government should continue to fund and support core activities of these organisations which are providing a valuable role in coordinating and targeting training in our ever changing workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This in turn is improving the job prospects of many young Australians. One of the great successes of group training has been the placement of many of its clients. If you like, it meets that acid test. BACAS currently has 200 young apprentices and trainees on its books&mdash;an achievement we are quite proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the day following the minister's visit to my electorate, the shadow minister for youth affairs, Senator Campbell, and the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) visited Bundaberg as part of the coalition's national youth road tour. We hosted a forum at the Bundaberg campus of the Central Queensland University at which about 40 young people, students and youth workers, attended to share their views on matters of concern to youth in our part of Australia. These included youth crisis accommodation, the increasing incidence of sexual abuse amongst teenagers, public transport and youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of youth unemployment, when the minister's exhortation of the previous day to create 5,000 jobs in Bundaberg was raised&mdash;it was raised in quite a benign way&mdash;it was met with peals of cynical laugher from the audience. Such was the commentary of youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the employment concerns that had been raised included the lack of real full-time job opportunities, even after a training program; the frustration with accessing certain labour market programs&mdash;some lamented the fact that they had to be out of work for 18 months to access them; the lack of part-time employment, especially for students looking to supplement Austudy payments; the criticism of employers for discriminating against young people on the basis of age&mdash;it is cheaper to employ a 14- or 15-year-old than an 18-year-old; the axing of the JPET program for homeless youth in Bundaberg and leaving those people to the whims of the already overloaded DEET case management regime. They were just a few of the comments made by young people at the youth forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I became despondent when one of the critics of the coalition youth forum was the National Union of Students, which, as we all know, has become an excellent mouthpiece for the ALP. Rather than support or encourage the process that enabled greater student input into the policy development program, the NUS saw it simply as an opportunity to make a political attack on the coalition&mdash;I might add that they were not at the forum; this was all in the media afterwards&mdash;everything from the champagne socialist joke to the clothes we supposedly wore, and they even got down to the 1993 youth wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is unfortunate that the NUS could not forget its own political connections and for once think about advancing the plight of the people that it claims to represent&mdash;namely, the students. Here was an opportunity for students throughout Australia to tell a group of politicians what they really felt about issues that affected them directly. They certainly did that at the Bundaberg forum, which was opened by the vice president of the local student council, presumably a NUS member. There was very little liaison between the national body and the local body in this exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier that week the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the shadow cabinet were my guests in Gladstone. While in the harbour city, Mr Howard and shadow education minister, Senator Hill, met with representatives of the Central Queensland University Student Union from both Gladstone and Rockhampton. This was in stark contrast to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) snapping at students in Adelaide to get a job. It seems the NUS is happy to roll over and have its tummy scratched by the government rather than face up to some of the real issues that concern its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the recent state election there was a letter in one of my local newspapers from a so-called student representative claiming that they had no choice but to vote for Labor. What a cop-out. Have they forgotten about the meddling with HECS and Austudy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the low student population ratio in central Queensland, which is about 60 per cent, the region continues to be under-funded in terms of real university places. Even with the budget allocation of 4,200 new places for Queensland institutions over the next three years, Central Queensland University does not get its fair share. In fact, our allocation is a mere 420 extra places for 1996-97, of which 100 were previously announced by the then minister, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in essence, CQU was allocated 320 new places out of this year's budget which, when you spread them over five campuses over two years, amounts to very little going into each campus and falls well short of expectations. While these university places are principally allocated to areas of high population growth, I believe there should also be a special preference given to areas with high unemployment. This would have the benefit of lifting the skills in the region as well as increasing employment opportunities for the young people affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister for employment correctly stated recently, youth unemployment ultimately affects all of us, not just this generation but future generations of Australians as well. Youth unemployment is by no means a simple problem. Rather, it is a complex problem that requires a range of responses, some of which I have tried to outline today. Ultimately, the key to sustainable job creation is greater economic growth, appropriate spending on infrastructure, which is abysmally lacking in central Queensland, and micro-economic and taxation reform to enable businesses to expand and to take on more staff. These mainstream economic reforms, together with structured and targeted training, will improve the outlook of many young Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the grievance debate today to take the opportunity to once again place concerns before this parliament relating to a very important issue within my electorate: the Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. This is a subject which I have raised in debate on the floor of this parliament time and time again. I raise this issue again today because of the continuing misapprehensions circulating in my area over Sydney West airport and the malicious glee that certain individuals now seem to have in stoking them into the fears that some people have now sadly begun entertaining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of south-western Sydney are no more an ungrateful community than any other part of Australia. They have the same willingness to applaud government when it does something smart, just as they will exercise their right to complain when an issue is perhaps not being dealt with as they would like. The people of south-western Sydney want more jobs, an improved transport infrastructure, and all the other benefits that will flow on from Badgerys Creek, but before that they want answers&mdash;answers which this government must provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, we are faced with two major questions which my constituents, and those in my colleague's electorates nearby, want addressed. How will the flight paths at the airport, when they are determined, affect those individuals, and why is the airport currently intended to operate on a 24-hour basis? I have never seen the need for an airport to operate on a 24-hour basis. As I have said before in this House, if Kingsford Smith airport can manage to operate at a profit with a night-time curfew, then surely any new airport to be built in Sydney's west can do so just as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people surrounding Badgerys Creek have exactly the same desires for night-time peace and quiet as those in the inner city. Surely they should be treated with the same respect and consideration. Yet, while we in the government are doing our best to allay concern in the community, and while we have continually said that issues such as the airport's flight paths will only be determined after extensive independent analysis and community consultations, we still have elements&mdash;disreputable, malicious elements&mdash;who choose to continue spreading misinformation for their own self gain. I believe that if we in the Labor Party are indeed the `true believers', then those people who are spreading these rumours are the `true deceivers'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have certain individuals within my electorate, I kid you not, who are cheating the people of south-western Sydney into thinking that somehow a vote against Labor in any upcoming federal election would mean a step towards halting all airport proceedings: not a delay, not a pause, not a cessation of work, but a complete and unadulterated halt. The people who are spreading these untruths have become very prominent in our communities for this fact alone. Some of them have even gained seats on our councils in the recent local government elections. Perhaps these people have been talking about it so much that they have even fooled themselves into believing that such an eventuality could manifest itself. Well, I think it is time that I once again put them straight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their pipedreams are not based on fact. The Sydney West airport cannot and will not be stopped. It is up to us to make sure that when it does start being built it is developed thoughtfully and in consideration of the people of south-western Sydney. That is what this government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, a federal coalition government means the fast-tracking of Badgerys Creek without consultation: no delays for them, no pauses and certainly no involvement of the community. For the coalition, the people in Sydney's west are, and always have been, used as `fall guys'. When the coalition's traditional voters on the north shore and the eastern suburbs start getting upset over an issue, more often than not Sydney's west is pointed out as a useful target for any undesirable development. This will occur when and if the coalition ever comes into power. This is not going to happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), a person I have quoted many times on this subject to highlight the opposition's policies in this area, was clear in his intentions over Badgerys Creek in recent conversation with the mayor of Marrickville, Barry Cotter. Mr Howard told Mr Cotter that the coalition supported `the fast-tracking of Badgerys Creek'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no room for any sort of different interpretation of a comment like that. The Leader of the Opposition's intention is clear&mdash;crystal clear: no new environmental impact statement, not even a supplementary EIS, to which this government has committed itself. Mr Howard stated that the opposition will rush at developing Badgerys Creek like a bull at a gate if the coalition wins the election; not for the sake of the people of south-western Sydney, and not for their economic or social benefits, but for those of his blue-ribbon constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition is concerned that the present government is not moving fast enough. In July he wrote that the Labor government has `demonstrated a clear lack of commitment to this particular project'. I find that puzzling, particularly when one reads the budget papers and finds that an extra $762 million is intended for allocation to the project. If that is an example of lack of commitment, I would like to know what is commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that what the Leader of the Opposition sees as a `lack of commitment' is actually the government's unwillingness to condemn the people of Sydney's greater west to an `airport hell' as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> so colourfully put it recently. We want to make sure that it is done correctly. We are not about to make knee-jerk decisions to make life easier for a few of those silvertails in the electorate of the member for Bennelong, and in so doing punish the people in Sydney's west. We are approaching this project with forthrightness based on solid community consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has even had a letter published in one of our local newspapers, not addressing the issues that would interest them about Badgerys Creek&mdash;because we all know where he stands on that&mdash;but about the `airport noise crisis', as he put it, at Mascot. He says that the present government has `turned a deaf ear' to the people of the inner city. This remark was published in a paper in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from it!. The government is about sharing the load and that is why Badgerys Creek is being built: to act as a supplementary airport to Mascot. The Leader of the Opposition wants to fast-track Sydney West airport and he wants it operating at an international capacity as soon as possible. He has even said that he will force airlines to base themselves at Badgerys Creek to guarantee its viability. He does not want to balance the operations between the two Sydney airports; he wants the people of Sydney's west to bear the heavier burden, just as all coalition governments have desired in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not just the Leader of the Opposition and his party who are working to deceive the people of south-western Sydney. Certain elements in Sydney's inner city are also involved. These people continue to make the trip out to our areas, gather at our local airport meetings and then attempt to sabotage what is normally a level-headed exchange of concerns and information. On the one hand, these people&mdash;professional spoilers and stirrers, as I like to refer to them&mdash;have been campaigning vociferously not only to have Mascot's third runway shut down, but to have the entire airport's operation halted as soon as Badgerys Creek begins running. Then they have the gall&mdash;and I believe hypocrisy&mdash;to come to our meetings and attempt to coach members of our community on how to stop Sydney West airport going ahead. Talk about two facedness and deceit!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Sydney's west deserve much better than this. The concerns of members of our community are genuine and the federal Labor government must treat them as genuine. That is why the Department of Transport, in conjunction with the Federal Airports Corporation, has today opened to the public an information centre on the airport's intended site to help alleviate any worries and to give answers to questions raised by the population at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Information at that centre, situated on Badgerys Creek Road, will be updated regularly and experts will be on hand seven days a week to talk to members of the community about anything concerning the airport. There are even plans to organise a mobile centre which will tour the popular shopping areas in the region giving out information and working to alleviate any worries that may exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to get Sydney West airport right. We must get Sydney West airport right. We are working to cut through the clouds of rumour circulated by people who either refuse to hear our words or who are no longer capable of sitting down and looking at the facts objectively. As the federal member for Prospect, I have raised&mdash;and will continue to raise&mdash;the concerns of my constituents over the flight paths for Sydney West airport and the proposed no curfew policy. I am committed to making sure that the decisions the government makes are taken with the best interests of the people of Sydney's west at heart. I can assure my community that I will continue to pursue their concerns until we have the answers that we want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, I will not shirk from standing in this House again and again to expose the hypocrisy of certain individuals&mdash;those `would-be leaders of our community'&mdash;whose sole reason seems to be choosing Sydney West airport as a topic of debate not only to promote themselves but for their own self gain.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity today to speak in this place about an issue which has outraged many people in my electorate. On 14 June, the French government announced that it would resume testing nuclear weapons at Mururoa Atoll, bringing to an end the moratorium that had been observed since 1992. As June drew to a close, letters and calls opposing the resumption of testing continued to flood into my office. The message was clear: stop the bomb. Opposition to French nuclear testing is well-founded.

But, complete with wide hats, drinks, sunscreen, banners and Australian flags, we covered the distance in good humour. It was estimated there were several hundred international participants and, in all, about 4,000 people taking part. I was particularly touched by the warm reception given to us by those who stood by the roadside or who came out of their homes as we passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While not boasting any real talent, we did sing <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advance Australia Fair</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS> and a hastily-worded song to the tune of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frere Jacques</EMPHASIS> which we even managed to sing in parts. It went something like this: `Jacques Chirac, Jacques Chirac; you are sleeping, you are sleeping; warning bells are ringing, warning bells are ringing; stop your bomb, stop your bomb.' I think John Ryan from the New South Wales parliament can take most credit for this number. The protest march was very peaceful, and I was later told that members of the media contingent filming from a bridge as we came down the road confessed to `not having a dry eye amongst them'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the march&mdash;and, I have to say, after some fairly intense negotiations&mdash;I managed with some of my colleagues to personally deliver hundreds of letters of protest to the French High Commissioner. Throughout the march I had carried letters from hundreds of school children from Adelaide as well as letters from Archbishop Faulkner, Archbishop George, the Council of Ex-Servicewomen of South Australia and the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard. At a later rally I was able to read from John Howard's letter, which I now put on the parliamentary record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the People and Nations of the South Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision by the French government to resume nuclear testing on Mururoa Atoll is one that has outraged Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the leader of the Federal Coalition which represents a large number of these people in our parliament, I am writing to express support for your efforts to force the French government to abandon testing at Mururoa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The South Pacific is not a vast expanse of empty ocean in which distant nations can undertake the activities that are too dangerous or unpopular to undertake in their own back yards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is your home, the place from which you derive your livelihood and your culture and the French government's determination to proceed with testing at Mururoa Atoll despite your opposition must be loudly condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to resume nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific is also contrary to the spirit of the recent Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review and Extension Conference and undermines attempts to finalise the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both of these Treaties are crucial elements of an emerging nuclear weapons control regime and again, the French government must be condemned for jeopardising this regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a nation on the rim of the Pacific, we are your neighbours and it is in this spirit that members of the Liberal Party have travelled to Papeete.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My federal parliamentary colleague, Trish Worth, is the spokesperson for these members and I have asked her to present this letter of support to you.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>The following two days were taken up by negotiations to establish an international network to continue the protest that we had begun and by meeting with residents, including the Archbishop of Papeete. I am hopeful that the international network will work well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there was some discussion as to what role Oscar Temaru should have in this network, it was finally resolved that he should be interim chairman for the next year and that Senator Bruce Childs should be secretary. I commend Senator Childs for the role he played in these negotiations. The network is to be known as Parliamentarians for a Nuclear-Weapons-Free World, and it adopted the following as its charter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be a network of Parliamentarians co-operating on a continuing basis as a network to exchange information and plan action including meetings from time to time to achieve a primary purpose of the cessation of all nuclear tests and the dismantling of all nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To achieve the above purposes Parliamentarians will use all the existing political and parliamentary associations including the IPU and the UN in addition to the initiatives in their own Parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA>We left Papeete in the early hours of Tuesday, 5 September, only to find as we left the plane in Sydney that the French government had exploded its first bomb. This was devastating news, as was the television coverage of the riots in Papeete. It had seemed such a peaceful place. I had walked alone and unafraid in streets that I then saw ablaze. Isolated by international opinion and protest, President Chirac has somehow managed to blame others and, in particular, Australia and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first began campaigning against the decision to resume nuclear testing in our region, it was fashionable among cynics to suggest that the efforts of people such as myself would inevitably be in vain. In retrospect, I think the cynics have been proven wrong. Certainly the French government has already exploded one nuclear weapon too many. However, there is evidence that France will not proceed with the full eight tests as initially planned, and this is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the international anger that has been brought to bear on France has shown that nations, even nuclear powers, will be held accountable for their actions by the international community of which they are a part. The message that has been sent loudly and clearly, not only to France but also to the other nuclear powers, is that the non-nuclear nations&mdash;among which Australia numbers&mdash;are deadly serious about seeing the implementation of a set of international treaties to control the proliferation of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The integrity of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and its ability to thwart the emergence of new nuclear powers is entirely dependent on the existing nuclear powers observing their side of the bargain&mdash;that is, showing `utmost restraint' in regard to the development of their nuclear capacities. The cessation of testing of nuclear weapons is the foundation of this `restraint'. France's belief that it could, with impunity, conduct testing as a prelude to signing a comprehensive test ban treaty has been shown to be completely misguided and, in the process, the commitment of the other nuclear powers to a comprehensive test ban treaty has been strengthened. </PARA>

Boonah Shire has been affected by drought for the past four years, and indeed its major water supply, Moogerah Dam, is totally dry. Irrigation has been cut to all farms in the area. This has led to very substantial problems, particularly given that the area is noted for the growing of potatoes, carrots and other small crops, and for its horticulture. Also, it is quite a sizeable pig producer, and the cost of grain in the area has in fact meant that pig production has been depleted.</PARA></TALK.START>

Over the weekend we saw parts of Sydney and other places receiving rain, and it is then we realised the very serious social problems that drought brings with it: industries are diminished and the work which can realistically be done in the community is brought to a halt. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has also been welcomed by the MTIA, the Metal Trades Industry Association, and the ACTU. So some of the major players in this area are supportive of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfair dismissal and industrial relations bring to mind my own state of Western Australia and some of the unfair dismissals that have occurred there in recent times&mdash;the unfair dismissal of the member for Moore, Mr Filing, from his endorsement and the unfair dismissal of the member for Curtin, Mr Rocher, from his endorsement. There is clearly a link between the unfairness of their dismissals, the industrial relations legislation of the Western Australian government and the industrial relations aspirations of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the federal opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to go through a forensic study of those industrial relations laws, including unfair dismissal laws, which the Leader of the Opposition has committed himself to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to go through a bit of forensic analysis of what the Leader of the Opposition has committed himself to, and when he committed himself. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 20 June, Alan Wood, in an article entitled `West's IR reforms a time bomb for Howard', makes the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If John Howard thinks the worst of his political problems in Western Australia are now behind him, he had better think again.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explosive is in the form of proposed amendments to Western Australia's industrial relations legislation, in particular amendments aimed at the operation of unions, which Kierath calls his "second wave" of industrial reforms.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995, the focus is likely to shift to the west, with . . . the message "vote Liberal federally and this is what they will do to you".</PARA>
<PARA>He also says that from an analysis of the Western Australian industrial relations legislation it seems that it is likely and destined to play a key role in the forthcoming federal election campaign, due in the next six months or so. We have seen Mr Howard commit himself to those industrial relations laws of Western Australia. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of Saturday, 29 July said `Howard: WA is our model'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I continue on in that guise, it is interesting to see some analysis of the unfair dismissal provisions of the Western Australian legislation contained in the current legislation in place in Western Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An analysis by a couple of well-known QCs in Western Australia of those two pieces of legislation and their effect is worth taking some note of.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation does not protect prospective employees who wish to be employed pursuant to an award rather than a workplace agreement in circumstances where the prospective employer requires that they enter into a workplace agreement as a precondition to employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation does not protect employees who have entered into workplace agreements in circumstances where their employer threatens to dismiss them from their employment by notice, in accordance with their contract of employment, for the purpose of compelling them to accept less favourable terms and conditions of employment in a new workplace agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, you get the sack if you disagree. The opinion goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation does not protect employees in circumstances where their employer threatens to dismiss them from their employment by notice, in accordance with their contract of employment, for the purpose of compelling them to accept the terms and conditions of employment in a workplace agreement proposed by the employer, except in the situation where an employer has not previously entered into a workplace agreement. Whether the employee is actually protected will depend upon the particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>The opinion concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation does not protect employees if their employer dismisses all its work force by notice, advertises their jobs and then employs only those persons, including the former employees, who are willing to enter into a workplace agreement on the terms and conditions specified by the employer.</PARA>
<PARA>You can see the harsh and pernicious terms that apply in the existing legislation in Western Australia&mdash;what is known as the `first wave' of the state government's legislation. As will become clear, that is the precise policy which the federal opposition leader has committed himself to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To get some indication as to how pieces of Western Australian legislation have been received, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of Wednesday, 21 June, under the heading `Kierath plans flawed', says:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labour Relations Minister Graham Kierath's plans would bring the community pain in exchange for marginal benefits, chamber labour relations director Brendan McCarthy said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>A quote from Mr McCarthy reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Why legislate knowing something is not going to work? Because it is unworkable and because it impractical, it would be bad legislation and we are opposed to that," Mr McCarthy said.</PARA>
<PARA>That concerns the second wave. We have heard the learned opinion of two QCs, including Mr Viner, on some aspects of the first wave of legislation, and we have heard the views of the chamber of commence on the proposed second wave. An editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on the following day, Thursday, 22 June, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be a clear signal to him to think again for the sake of industrial stability when both the WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Trades and Labor Council denounce his legislative proposals as unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Mr Kierath has shown a hidebound resistance to calls for change to controversial parts of his so-called second wave of industrial legislation, despite the blunt rejection of them by the most affected parties.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community will not support laws that are unfairly one-sided in their application&mdash;or appear to be based on vindictiveness rather than need&mdash;regardless of whether unions strike over them.</PARA>
<PARA>So the view of the second wave of legislation in the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> is not unlike those of the chamber of commerce&mdash;unfairly one-sided and appearing to be based on vindictiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So with all this out in the public arena in June of this year, we find that the Leader of the Opposition visited Western Australia in July of this year. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of Saturday, 29 July 1995 we find the big story which handcuffs the federal opposition to the Western Australian industrial relations legislation and proposals&mdash;`Howard: WA is our model'. The story says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Federal coalition government would mirror the industrial relations policies implemented by the Court Government in Western Australia, Federal Opposition Leader, John Howard, said yesterday.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"I would like to see throughout Australia an industrial relations system that is largely similar to what the coalition Government has implemented in Western Australia," he said.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to refer to a comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are pleased that the Federal (coalition's) industrial relations policy will be modelled on what we have successfully implemented here.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, of course, a quote from the Western Australian Premier, Richard Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have the handcuff firmly applied. Just in case members opposite might think that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> got it wrong, in the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry bulletin of August 1995 there is an article which says that Mr Howard praised the industrial relations policies instituted by the WA Liberal government and promised to develop a similar environment at the federal level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With his eyes open and in full knowledge and understanding&mdash;we assume&mdash;of the first wave of legislation and the proposed second wave, the Leader of the Opposition has handcuffed himself and the opposition to the Western Australian model of industrial relations legislation. In August this year in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> we find further developments in the forensic expose. The article by Nigel Wilson states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia's industrial relations laws&mdash;touted by the federal Opposition leader, Mr Howard, as the template for a federal Coalition government's workplace reforms&mdash;are already regarded as the most draconian in the country.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The West Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has warned the Government Mr Kierath's proposed changes would produce "very marginal gains" and are "threatening and provocative".</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Wilson's article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howard told a lunch in Perth last month the State's industrial relations laws were the model for the federal Coalition and that he believed a federal Coalition government could adapt them so that up to 79 per cent of Australia's industrial relations activities would be covered from the national capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the audience were chamber executives who, while endorsing the existing WA industrial laws, have pointed out that Mr Kierath's proposed changes could damage both local business and Australia's international reputation.</PARA>
<PARA>There we find over a period of almost three months&mdash;June, July and August of this year&mdash;the federal Leader of the Opposition clearly committing himself, and it being perceived that way by people in Western Australia including the Chamber of Commerce, to that particular model and regime of industrial relations legislation. This is picked up again in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 17 August under the heading, `Bosses question industry reforms', in a story which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WA industry leaders have raised concerns about Labor Relations Minister Graham Kierath's planned industrial reforms with the Federal coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">WA company chiefs . . . told Federal Opposition industrial relations spokesman Peter Reith at a meeting in Perth last week . . . about the State Government's proposed reforms.</PARA>

<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pressure on Mr Kierath to reconsider some of his plans continued this week, with the revelation that the WA Chamber of Mines and Energy and the Australian Mines and Metals Association had written to him outlining their concerns about the proposals.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on, interestingly, to report Mr Kierath as saying that he rejected speculation that the federal coalition was pressuring him to delay or change his industrial plans, saying he outlined his proposals to federal opposition leader John Howard when he was in Perth a few weeks ago. Mr Kierath said that Mr Howard had supported the plans wholeheartedly. That was on 17 August. That comment by Mr Kierath was repeated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> of 20 August. Mr Kierath is reported to have rejected the same claims about federal coalition pressure on him, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've had no warnings at all. The only discussions I've had is with John Howard . . . and he seemed very supportive of the principles.</PARA>
<PARA>To August this year we find the handcuff to the Leader of the Opposition. It has been confirmed by the state Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Kierath, that not just the first wave but the second wave is supported by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, told Parliament that Mr Howard had effectively endorsed the West Australian legislation&mdash;which has yet to gain Cabinet approval&mdash;as a template for his own policy.</PARA>

" Mr Howard said later that the endorsement related only to the reforms already passed by the West Australian Government and did not refer to the so-called "second wave" reforms.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not what we find in the forensic evidence and that is not what Mr Kierath is reported to have said the next day. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"He (Howard) said what constitutes the second wave . . . are things the coalition feel very strongly about and agree with wholeheartedly," Mr Kierath said then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also said Mr Howard was happy with his reasons for going ahead with the two proposals criticised by the WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have it. It was brought to a conclusion by Nigel Wilson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> when he said, `Liberal IR reforms go too far and too fast.' So the federal opposition is handcuffed not just to wave one of the Western Australian legislation but to wave two as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just in case anyone was under any illusions as to the effect of wave one of the legislation, the effect of the Workplace Agreements Act, which was passed by the Western Australian parliament in 1993, is that under the act an agreement entered into by an employer and an employee, provided it meets certain formal requirements and is registered by the Commissioner for Workplace Agreements, will set aside all state award provisions that would otherwise apply to the conditions and wages of that employee. The regime created by the act has had an extremely harsh impact on employees and contains a number of serious flaws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the adverse and harsh impact that piece of legislation has had. The minimum conditions of employment enshrined by that piece of legislation include 40 hours of work at a weekly rate of pay of $301.10, which comes to an hourly rate of pay of $7.53. When you go through some of the common awards you will find how inferior those minimum conditions are to those award payments. Under the shop assistants award, for example, the comparative information is for 38 hours of work with $401 being the weekly rate of pay, or $10.55 as an hourly rate of pay. For fast food, grade 1, the award is for 38 hours at $396.60, or $10.44 as an hourly rate of pay. For a clerical assistant, grade 1, it is 38 hours for $374.80, or $9.86 as an hourly rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So you can see that the effect of the legislation is to drag those award conditions down. You know what the policy of the opposition is: it is precisely mirrored by the Western Australian legislation. Their policy and approach in this area are precisely the same as they are across the board; that is, bash the worker, slash wages and conditions, and leave no effective award safety net in place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;People listening to this broadcast could well be forgiven for thinking that we are standing in Western Australia, that it is midafternoon and that we are in the Western Australian parliament, because the contribution from the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has done nothing more than focus on what he sees as the Western Australian legislation and what he imagines&mdash;quite wrongly, as indicated by the shadow minister for industrial relations&mdash;to be the link between the federal opposition and the Western Australian government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that we are standing here in the federal parliament, looking at the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill, and indicating that the opposition is not intending to oppose this legislation. I bring to the House the words of the shadow minister for industrial relations. In moving an amendment, the shadow minister indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill and whilst recognising that this Bill provides some improvement to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, the House is of the opinion that, even as amended, the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act remain a disincentive to job creation, that they impose a very heavy burden on business, particularly on small business, and that they were enacted without proper prior consultation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very different scene from the scene painted by the honourable member for Perth, who spent the 20 minutes of his speech focusing entirely on the Western Australian legislation. Mr Deputy Speaker, you, in common with the shadow minister at the table, have heard all of the comments from the member for Perth, the member for Lilley (Mr Swan), the member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) and the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). They have left all listeners with the impression that all the opposition seeks to do in industrial relations is to get people to work for less and make it easier for employers to dismiss them. In one word, the government has painted the picture that all that the opposition stands for is exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow minister for industrial relations indicated by his comments, he is not seeking to oppose this legislation; he welcomes sectors of it. His great concern about the legislation is precisely the same as it was when its unamended form was introduced in the House, and that is that it is a disincentive to employment. It runs counter to job creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I had the shadow minister for industrial relations in my electorate. He was there to address a very successful branch function. Because we had an hour and a half to spare I thought I would take him to some of the most labour intensive industries in my electorate and let him see for himself what happens in labour intensive industries in Australia. I note that the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) has entered the chamber. He will be as aware as I am of the dilemma that labour intensive industries face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with the opposition shadow spokesman on industrial relations, I stood with people who were picking citrus fruit in the Wakeley area who were there as contractors, who were there choosing to work on a Sunday because the weather suited them and they had a particular family program that meant that Sunday was a more convenient day for working than were other times of the week. They were happily part of the team determined to fuel the emerging export industry in export quality citrus. They freely indicated to the shadow minister for industrial relations the employment arrangements they had entered into, the contract arrangements they had entered into, the opportunities they saw for employment for the entire family in what they were doing and the arrangement they had with their employer, which reflected the very flexibility that the member for Perth was so critical of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it would be easy to give the impression that the opposition is seeking changes to the present unfair dismissal laws simply for some cheap political reason, or seeking to make it easier to exploit workers. The reality is that this is not the case, and this view is not held wholly by the opposition. Mr Carr, the Labor Premier of New South Wales, said about these very provisions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are kids going without jobs because of the way the unfair dismissal provision works in federal law. There are kids with good training, good education, who are not given employment because employers won't take them on if they know that down the track, whatever the circumstances, it is very difficult to effect a dismissal. The European experience makes it very clear: if you make it complex for employers to vary their employment levels down the track, they won't take on the employment to start with. The federal provisions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this, by the way, is a Labor Premier speaking:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are a handbrake on employment growth. I want to revise the federal law. If we can, there are going to be more employers taking on young people who would otherwise be unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>Reflecting on just what Premier Carr was saying, the government has made some changes to the unfair dismissal provisions which are not being opposed by the opposition. In spite of all that has been said opposite about the opposition's attitude to industrial relations, the reality is that we are supporting these provisions and saying two things: first, with great respect&mdash;we told you so. We indicated all this would be necessary and we were ignored. Secondly, you can go even further than this in introducing flexibility into the labour market, to pick up the words of Premier Carr, `giving the opportunity to young people to be employed'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no recognition from participants opposite in this debate of the valid claims that the opposition has made that the existing unfair dismissal provisions have fuelled unemployment, have been a deliberate disincentive for people to employ people. This has been our cry, ignored by those opposite. In place of that recognition, we have had from those opposite nothing but constant carping and criticism of what they perceive to be the opposition's industrial relations policy; nothing but misrepresentation of what we stand for; nothing but the constant cry from Labor Party members that we in some strange way represent only the employers and would stand for anything that we could get away with that was exploitative; nothing but the impression of an enormous chasm between our attitude and what they are proposing. That is absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one thing that joins both the government and the opposition in the industrial relations debate&mdash;one thing that determines that every opposition member is as anxious as every government member to ensure that employees cannot be unfairly dismissed or unreasonably exploited&mdash;and that, Sir, is simply this: we are all parents. We all have young people seeking employment. I am the parent of a 23-year-old and a 20-year-old, currently still students and, as students, seeking to have employment opportunities to enhance their current income. I feel as bitterly about anyone exploiting my children as anyone over the other side feels about exploitation of theirs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My children, who work in the hospitality industry as well as being students, are involved in some way in an industry that has relatively little status in union terms and leaves itself open to exploitation. I get indignant if I feel that they are running the risk of being unfairly dismissed or of not being as realistically paid as anyone else. I want legislative proposals in place that ensure that all employees cannot be exploited. That is my commitment. It is the commitment of the shadow ministers on the front bench and at the table; it is the commitment of the opposition. We do not want an exploitative society, for exactly the same reasons as the government members do not want an exploitative society. We do not want people unfairly paid. What we do want&mdash;in common, by the way, with the government, though rarely recognised&mdash;are job opportunities in Australia. What we have had, as Premier Carr has clearly illustrated, are unfair dismissal provisions which have been maybe unintentional but nonetheless are an effective disincentive to employment, making it harder for our children and all Australians to get secure, well-paid jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal of time in this debate has been spent focusing on Western Australia, and on what was seen to be the second wave of amendments that the government in Western Australia was proposing to introduce that would in some way make Western Australia the area where everybody would be exploited. The shadow minister for small business may no doubt want an opportunity to comment on this as well. As I understand it, this raft of so-called second wave provisions in Western Australia provides initially for secret ballots before strikes are entered into. In a democracy, is it such a terrible provision to introduce the proposal that before you enter into a strike&mdash;not that you should be denied a ballot; that would be terrible&mdash;the ballot that you conduct should be conducted in secret? That is nothing more than the heart of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter whether those who propose that our present democratic system should be changed so that we no longer have compulsory ballots are right or wrong. As far as I know, no-one proposing changes to the present democratic system in Australia is proposing that we should do away with secret ballots&mdash;with every one of my family members having the right to vote in an election as they see fit and unknown to me. Precisely the same provision ought to apply in industrial relations, particularly before people choose to go into strike mode. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me reassure the House that as someone standing here as an employer, anxious to have employees who are happy to work for me and keen to be productive, in common with the vast majority of employers I am not offended by the hourly rate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor government has foisted upon the small business community one of the most draconian and discriminatory industrial relations regimes imaginable. It is anti-employment, anti-investment and anti-business growth and has been overseen by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), who has absolutely no credibility in the business community in respect of his consideration of a review of the unfair dismissal provisions of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act have been the cause of considerable controversy since the law on unfair dismissals in Australia was changed by the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993. Indeed, Ian Spicer, chief executive of the ACCI, summed up the government's IR reforms perfectly in February this year when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we also have now in Australia a new growth industry; the so-called unlawful dismissal industry, spurred on by the current deluge of claims, now being received at a rate of around 150 new applications each week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have to date been over 5,000 dismissal applications lodged placing considerable burdens upon individual employers in responding to these claims. More importantly there is now significant evidence that the operations of these termination provisions are interfering with improvements in the labor market by frustrating company decision making processes regarding employment creation.</PARA>
<PARA>Those comments were made in February. The total of unfair dismissal claims has now risen to in excess of 10,125. The impact on and cost to the small business sector has escalated in the same proportions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses have been confronted with exorbitant, vexatious and outrageously expensive claims for unfair dismissal by employees who, in many instances, had been dismissed for perfectly satisfactory and rational reasons. The provisions are universally agreed by employer and business organisations to be restrictive and biased and to place too much weight on process rather than principle and practicality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was informed by a small business proprietor who visited my office only last week that one member of his staff reported her suspicions that another staff member was stealing stock from the shop. A few days later, the owner himself caught the individual in the act of stealing, yet he was too paralysed by the fear of an unfair dismissals claim to do what he should be legally able to do to protect the profitability of his business, boost the morale of his honest staff and maintain his own integrity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He should be free to instantly dismiss employees such as the one he described to me, yet this government's legislation prevented him from doing so. This is one of thousands of similar stories all over the country. The labor government's bad legislation has hindered the application of good management practices, is reducing business profits and viability, is increasing business costs, is reducing employment prospects as employers react to their experiences in dealing with the flow-on effects of the unfair dismissal provisions, is reducing the confidence of small business proprietors, and is increasing the uncertainty of owning and operating a small business in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has the government done any economic analysis of the impact of these unfair dismissal provisions? Has the government considered the cost to government outlays from employers' reluctance to increase employment opportunities, or from the changes to employment profiles, as more employers seek `safer' ways to employ?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quality of employment opportunities in many small businesses has declined and the ministers responsible have never expressed any concern at all&mdash;neither the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) nor the Minister for Industrial Relations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ironical aspect of these unfair dismissal provisions is that they have been enacted by the same Labor government that has overseen the rise in Australia's unemployment to in excess of one million Australians at its peak. They have demonstrated that their union mates come first, and then employees, employers and finally the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the arrogance of the ministers concerned is such that they could not see the damage that was being done to the confidence of Australia's small business sector. The government has successfully sown the seeds of doubt into the minds of the country's predominant employment sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With massive unemployment and under-employment around Australia, this is one of the most disgraceful acts that could be perpetrated by a government that is forever making soothing noises about its concern for the unemployed. The imposition of these draconian dismissal provisions has been condoned by the small business minister, Senator Schacht, who has repeatedly refused to listen to and act on the concerns of the small business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His silence and inaction on the concerns of the small business sector reflect the fact that he has never had the responsibility of employing people himself.

But, most importantly&mdash;a point that has been lost on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the ministers responsible for this fiasco&mdash;there has been a loss of confidence by employers and a lack of willingness on their part to employ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition understands the crisis of confidence in small business in the community at present and believes that profit should not be a dirty word. Reasonable profit should be the reasonable expectation of people who are prepared to put their family home at risk and to put their all into running a small business and employing other Australians. It is the foundation of confidence that is reasonable profit. It is a foundation of confidence, investment and employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must be very clear why we are debating this legislation here today. It has nothing to do with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) or the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) suddenly seeing the light on the road to Damascus and recognising the legitimate concerns of small business employers. It has everything to do with the big hand of the Prime Minister clearing the decks for an early election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 June, when the Prime Minister delivered his humiliating rebuff to his mate the Minister for Industrial Relations, he was simply desperate to get rid of some electoral baggage that he knew would be a major issue in the forthcoming election. He was belatedly acknowledging the well-founded criticisms and protests of major employer organisations and individual employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill have been introduced to thwart an embarrassing employer campaign in the lead-up to the next election. Employers should carefully scan the skies for other backdoor measures that the government will try to introduce to overcome the embarrassment of this backdown. Remember the l-a-w tax cuts; one blink and they were gone. But it is very obvious that the ministers' hearts are just not in the process of these amendments. Their staunch support for the previous legislation is testament to that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the shadow minister for industrial relations, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), stated on 21 June 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have run a long and constructive campaign to highlight the gross deficiencies of Labor's unfair dismissal provision. But as recently as 31 May, Brereton accused me of running a campaign of total misinformation and asserting that his provisions had got the balance of policy right.</PARA>
<PARA>The commitment of the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations must also be questioned. During question time in this place on 7 June this year, the assistant minister arrogantly treated with contempt Australia's chambers of commerce when he said that he had spoken to a number of chambers around Australia who indicated this. I will quote the minister's words in this place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They say the game is now over because employers are learning that there are reasonable ways in which they can dismiss people.</PARA>
<PARA>While the minister's response in question time on 7 June grossly misrepresented the position of the Australian chambers of commerce and was simply a fabrication of the minister's imagination, the reaction from the business community was swift and expected. The headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review </EMPHASIS>on 13 June told the story. It said in bold headlines `Business rejects claims on dismissal legislation'. </PARA>

<PARA>Mr Edwards went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can't think of any chamber of commerce, or even a single business, that is not worried by the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the largest chamber of commerce, I am surprised Mr Johns has not checked with us&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the QCCI has certainly never given Mr Johns or any Cabinet member any indication whatsoever that the chamber supports the unfair dismissal legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, quite the opposite is true. QCCI has been a consistent critic of unfair legislation federally and in Queensland because of its negative effects on employment and its unfair approach to the issue of dismissals.</PARA>
<PARA>The government has elevated spinning on statements that are blatantly without substance to an art form. Too frequently this goes unchallenged by industry and the community. It must have been awful for the assistant minister to get such a solid thump on the ear from the business community on unfair dismissal provisions. With a performance like that one, it will be a long time before he loses his learner's plates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry groups around Australia have expressed cautious optimism that the amendments in this bill will overcome the barriers to employment created by the government's ineptitude.

But, unfortunately, the political expediency that has surrounded the introduction of these amendments suggests that there is good cause for considerable doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, in relation to unfair dismissals, is more concerned about process than practical and fair outcomes for employees and employers. The coalition and others support the fact that dismissals have to be fair. But they must be fair to all parties. It is a partnership. We are not back in the dark ages. We are not living 150 years ago when employers were seen to be like old Scrooge, who gave employees a rough time. We have moved very much forward from that. In today's commercial reality, in contemporary Australia, we have a very different arrangement. It is a partnership. If the trade union movement in this country is going to remain relevant, it has to catch up with that fact. It has to help create a situation of win-win rather than set one party against another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country has problems to be resolved. We have a current account crisis. We have a highly competitive global market to confront. Unless we have a trade union and ministers in government who are prepared to help employees produce the very best results, this country is headed for a bleak future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, in relation to unfair dismissals, is more concerned, as I said, about process rather than practice, and that has to change. In summary, I reiterate the important fact that the only reason we are debating this amendment is that the Prime Minister was running scared when he overruled Minister Brereton on the unfair dismissal provisions. In fact, he announced it at a lunch in Sydney at an international meeting of small business people. The Prime Minister announced it, not the minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to revisit on behalf of several distraught families in my electorate a matter that has previously been addressed by the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) and the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) in this place. I speak of the drug pulmozyme. We have already heard from these two members that thousands of cystic fibrosis sufferers could benefit from the listing of this drug on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Cystic fibrosis is a crippling disease which affects children, usually reducing the life expectancy of its sufferers to less than 30 years. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has said in this place that she will not move to help the sufferers of this disease by facilitating the listing of pulmozyme on the PBS. Currently, families who need pulmozyme are paying around $1,300 a month to supply their children with the treatment. I do not know of many families in my electorate who could afford that without financial assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To use the drug currently, a family would need to find over $15,000 per annum for each child with the disease. It is all but impossible in families where more than one child suffers, unless they are lucky enough to be part of a very wealthy household. I suspect that the minister has been a bit busy with other things to be able to give her full attention to this matter, but in the very limited time I have available to me I would like to try to implore her to realise just how important access to this drug is to some Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to read a letter from one of my constituents. It is a letter which sent a shiver down my spine when I read it and, as they read it, I hope the minister or someone on her staff might think about the pain and anguish that is being suffered not only by the children who have this horrible disease, but by the families of the sufferers&mdash;in particular, the parents, who feel impotent in trying to save the lives of their loved ones. There are hidden sufferers; these are the hidden sufferers. Yet they could be helped by helping the children they love. Parents and grandparents, like the Taylor family, the Rosario family, the Challen family, the Weddell family and the Chandler family, to name just a few in my electorate, have suffered. The letter I wish to read is from Mr Ray Taylor of Banff Court in Duncraig in my electorate. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sir</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to seek your support in obtaining Pharmaceutical Benefits listing for a new product called Pulmozyme which will benefit people with Cystic Fibrosis (CF).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CF is a dreadful genetic disease that attacks the lungs and digestive systems of its sufferers and considerably reduces life expectancy. My fourteen year old son died a slow, painful death from CF two years ago, an experience my wife and I will never forget nor wish to repeat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not wish the same thing to happen to his little sister who also has CF.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would you please use all the influence you have to get Pharmaceutical Benefits listing for Pulmozyme, as it offers the best hope for CF patients that we have seen in many years, and should be available to all, not just those that can afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">R W Taylor.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how much anguish writing that letter caused Mr Taylor; I suspect it caused him a great deal. At any rate, the courage of people like him and his wife cannot easily be understood by those of us who have&mdash;touch wood&mdash;healthy children at home. At any rate, Mr Taylor implored me to use any influence I have to assist him. To Mr Taylor and the many other families who have written to me with similar entreaties, I would say that I am trying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having written to the minister and received only a standard response in the past, I have raised the matter here tonight in an effort to penetrate some of the bureaucracy that currently surrounds this particular issue.

I note that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) is present here this evening. I hope that this message is conveyed. I am sure it will be. If at the end of the day this matter is not addressed, the Taylors, the Rosarios, the Chandlers, the Challens and the Weddells of Australia will continue to lose their children to cystic fibrosis, and the suffering to them and the children, and to all of those who have any association in any way with their loved ones, will be prolonged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to speak about a health problem in the community which is largely being ignored or, even worse, compounded. I refer to attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. They are major problems that, as the names imply, occur in children, teenagers, and even adults, suffering from lack of concentration, disruptive, childish behaviour and aggressive tendencies. Most damaging is the anti-social effect that these disorders have on society and the sufferer. At present there are a number of problem areas which require attention&mdash;that is, recognition of ways that the disorder can be treated. Obviously, the medical profession is generally conservative in its outlook and fairly slow to accept new methods of treatment. There is one called neurometrix. Parents whose children have been treated by this form of treatment are very confident that it does work, but it has been rejected by the NHMRC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that in schools there is a varied response to the children who suffer from these disorders. In some schools that I have visited I have found the staff prepared to accept the responsibility of handing out medication to those children who suffer. But, as you would be aware, Mr Speaker, this is not regarded as one of the responsibilities of the teaching profession. At some schools the staff decide that it is a responsibility they would rather not have. So in those schools the medication is not administered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, we are talking about medication such as ritalin or dexamphetamine, which only lasts for four hours. The school day is eight hours long, from the time the child leaves home to when they return home. If there is no-one to administer that drug in the middle of the day, the afternoon can be extremely disruptive. If you have more than one of these children in a class, the behaviour problem is passed on to the whole of that class. That becomes a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the electorate of Paterson I have been working with a number of support groups. As the community becomes aware of ADD and ADHD, support groups have been set up by the parents of the sufferers simply to try to find out more about the nature of the disorder and about its treatment. They have done an enormous amount of good, particularly in the educative process and by exchanging information on how treatment can be administered and what sort of treatment works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I have written to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) asking that she seriously consider getting the National Health and Medical Research Council to set up a working group to look into ways that the families of sufferers of ADD and ADHD can be supported in the community. What forms of help do they need and what forms of help can be supplied fairly quickly and on an even basis?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that in the electorate of Paterson psychiatric services are not readily available. If parents have to take their children to the nearest centre where it is available, they are probably faced with an 18-month wait before they can get in to see that specialist. One of the things that is urgently needed is the correct diagnosis. Is it a behavioural problem or a genetic problem? What has caused the disorder in the particular case? No two particular cases are necessarily the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week is Attention Deficit Disorder Awareness Week. I urge all members to go to their electorates, work with the groups that are trying to find out more and consult widely with them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My thoughts were provoked a little by an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> where a lecturer at the University of Queensland's Graduate School of Management, Dr Thomas Bramble, was telling a conference on unionism that there was a necessary condition for reversing union decline in the rank and file trade unionists. His paper shows that four of the five full-time officers on the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions have a combined total of six years work experience outside the trade union movement. The fifth, who happens to be Mr Mansfield&mdash;whom I have met a few times and is a fairly practical fellow&mdash;has at least served a four-year trade apprenticeship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that one statement we can see part of the problem facing our industrial relations system in this country. We have professional industry or union politicians who do not have a lot of practical experience in the workplace. In the rhetoric that passes for debate in this place from time to time, the role of the self-employed in small business enterprises&mdash;or SMEs as they are known more accurately these days&mdash;is ignored. The traditional role over many decades of leadership, commitment and discipline that has been provided by these hundreds of thousands of small businesses throughout Australia is too often ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am acutely aware of it within my own electorate of Grey&mdash;an electorate which I keep reminding this House has amongst the lowest incomes of this country. It contains 90 per cent of the state of South Australia in area and produces some 50 per cent of that state's export income but it is very low in terms of actual average income. About 25 per cent of my electorate has a linkage with small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow minister said, in regional Australia we are not particularly interested in this confrontationist approach, this fear and smear campaign, that the government, including the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), likes to indulge in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) correctly drew the House's attention to a recent court case in South Australia in which the memory of Premier Dean Brown was found to be somewhat lacking in relation to events which took place a day or so after the formation of his government in 1993. At that time when he came to office in South Australia he did so on a very substantial vote. Obviously, Premier Brown felt he could do no wrong and he had to sweep all before him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manner in which he did that in relation to Dr David Blaikie, the then Chairman of the Health Commission&mdash;in effect the CEO of the department of health, the Health Commission in South Australia, for which I was the minister for the two years prior to the election&mdash;was a very shabby process indeed. I think the recent Supreme Court case has not only amply demonstrated his inability to relate to the court accurately the circumstances which took place at that time, but also highlighted the extraordinary manner in which the government at that time dealt with a very experienced and senior public servant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than focus on the issues surrounding the Premier's recollection of those events and the way in which the court saw fit to criticise him for that, I will focus on another aspect of this matter&mdash;that is, the history, career and contribution of Dr David Blaikie. Although he has now been largely vindicated in relation to the manner in which he was effectively dismissed from the South Australian Public Service, what has not been effectively put on the record is the nature of his contribution over those many years and the manner in which he was effectively dismissed from that service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Blaikie was very much a career public servant. He had been a member of the Health Commission in one capacity or another for many years prior to becoming the chairman of that body. While he certainly possessed all the normal skills which you would expect of a senior public service official&mdash;he was a very competent manager and very experienced in a wide range of those areas&mdash;he also had some unique skills which I think particularly fitted him for the position of chairman. I certainly had experience of that during the time that he worked with me when I was Minister of Health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Blaikie was well able to move in the medical community, the hospital community and among the ancillary service providers&mdash;whatever profession that might encompass&mdash;and, indeed, in the general community, and determine the ebb and flow of events. This was not so much from a political perspective because that was not his job. That was the task of the minister of the day and should remain that way. But he was well able to understand the way in which the public relates to health; the way in which the various, often conflicting requirements of all the professions that contribute to the health industry are focused. He was able to bring that experience to bear on those problems and often reach accommodations and solutions which, in the end, furthered the best interests of the community as a whole as well as those of the health industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His contribution was a very important one during very difficult and trying times in terms of budgets, in terms of Medicare renegotiations. While my perspective on some of those Commonwealth-state relationships has changed somewhat in the last few years, I can certainly testify to his skill on behalf of the state of South Australia and on behalf of its taxpayers in terms of extracting the best possible deal from the Commonwealth. He knew a great deal of the background of those issues. His corporate experience, his corporate memory, was quite substantial. As minister, I often made considerable use of those skills in terms of obtaining the best possible arrangements for our state and ensuring that the arrangements that were put in place achieved the maximum advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To see such a career public servant dismissed effectively within a day of the government taking over, and in circumstances which were hardly appropriate or satisfactory, brought a great deal of sadness to me, as one who knew Dr Blaikie professionally, although I might say not personally that well. He was simply summarily pushed out of the public service without any effective attempt at negotiation or discussion about his position. No charges were brought against him. No charges were ever proved against him by the government. They simply decided they did not like him. While I accept that every government has a right to choose its permanent heads and those who serve it&mdash;that is clearly a right that any government has and I do not quarrel with it&mdash;I certainly think there is every reason to quarrel with the manner in which this was done. The way in which a senior, dedicated and committed public servant of South Australia was dealt with is I think something about which the government of Dean Brown should hang its head in shame. The Supreme Court of South Australia has dealt appropriately with this matter on this occasion. </PARA>

However, in our terms they are neither here nor there, nor in fact anywhere in particular. They are not in any one place but are all over the place. Because of being in this no-man's-land, they have little self-awareness and self-esteem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is manifest in the so-called depressed child, the defiant child, the bully or even the withdrawn child. These are understandable responses when you consider the words of expert, Dr Ken Whiting, who said of the people with ADD:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can you imagine what it must be like to get out of bed in the morning knowing that for the rest of the day you would be in trouble?</PARA>
<PARA>Add to this the fact that 65 per cent of ADD kids have more ear infections than any other child population, and therefore short-term but recurring hearing loss; and 60 per cent of ADD kids have some bi-motor difficulty, which means they may not be able to copy simple letters or shapes from the blackboard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us all understand that ADD is not the result of bad parenting. ADD is not the answer for most children's bad behaviour. ADD is not the latest yuppie disorder. It is a real disorder, a medical disorder, mainly genetically passed from generation to generation with at least four per cent of cases caused through frontal lobe injury or birthing and the often associated post-natal infection. It is a real concern on which the government in the United States of America spends in excess of $20 million annually on research grants through hospitals and universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are interesting facts, but let us look at the big picture. At a political level, ADD is an issue which is not contained within any single ministerial portfolio. It is vital that all members of the House are aware that the issue of ADD spans across and extends over the following portfolios: health, education, welfare, justice, employment and children's services, just to mention a few. In other words, governments at both federal and state levels need to take into account the individual human, family, community and financial costs engendered by people who suffer ADD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An integrated policy and introduction to appropriate services needs to be set as a priority, and there also needs to be a commitment from the responsible government ministers. ADD is not an issue to be placed in the too hard basket. In fact, as a matter of urgency, we need to identify testing programs for potential sufferers through early screening, place research dollars into both medical and university research areas, provide support services for parents and siblings of ADD, consult with education authorities on appropriate training for teachers and curriculum development to cater for ADD needs, establish both screening and treatment programs for identified adults and provide information to the wider community about the disorder as well as active ways to deal with sufferers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rhetoric is not the answer. Positive action and program implementation is the only way to tackle this issue head on. This is the week of ADD awareness. I join with my colleague the member for Paterson (Mr Horne) in encouraging all members of this House to take an active interest in this particular issue because it is an important issue to these children and their parents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, members of the House paid tribute to the memory of the late Dame Pattie Menzies. During the debate on the condolence motion, I added the condolences of the people of Alexandra in the state of Victoria, the place of birth of the late Dame Pattie Menzies. In the course of that debate, I also noted that the Dame Pattie Menzies Centre for the intellectually disabled is located at Alexandra and that hopefully the name of Dame Pattie Menzies will remain in Alexandra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great difficulty is that an uncaring Liberal Party is now making the future of that centre appear very dim indeed. Only a few weeks ago I received correspondence from the Dame Pattie Menzies Centre for the intellectually disabled requesting my intervention as a federal member in respect of the actions of the state government of Victoria. This year, as in past years, the disability groups in Victoria are being hit with what is known in Liberal Party terms as a 1.5 per cent efficiency dividend. In other words, these disability groups have to make further cuts to fund this 1.5 per cent dividend. They have already had to reduce services and sack staff. Nevertheless, they have to find another 1.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first Kennett budget imposed savage and vicious cuts, and we are now getting an increasing annual attack on these disability groups. I would have thought that, considering the home is called the Dame Pattie Menzies Centre for the intellectually disabled, the Liberal Party would at least want to preserve in perpetuity the memory of this great Australian lady. I would not have thought that the Liberal Party or a Liberal Party Premier would want to force this service to close in Alexandra. Yet that is the potential reality if this centre is forced to continue to make the vicious and savage cuts that the Kennett government is still imposing on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice my colleague the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) sitting on the other side of the House. I hope he is talking notes about what I am saying. After all, he is a member of the Liberal Party and can probably contact the Premier of Victoria, Jeffrey Gibb Kennett, about these matters. Hopefully, the honourable member will note that the Dame Pattie Menzies Centre for the intellectually disabled in Alexandra should not be forced to close because of an uncaring and unthinking Liberal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Ballarat comes from rural Victoria, he would probably know that rural Victoria cannot take much more, because the cuts are vicious. They are not cuts which are targeted at more efficient service delivery. They are across-the-board cuts. Each service, wherever it may be, is required to make the same cut. The service is not asked whether or not within the context of its budgetary framework it can maintain and provide the appropriate service efficiently or more cost effectively. Instead, it is simply told by the great centralists of the Australian political system&mdash;the Liberal Party&mdash;`You're getting less money, but you're supposed to provide the same service.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Alexandra, you cannot sell a house for love nor money. The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources has lost approximately four full-time employees from the office. The State Electricity Commission of Victoria office has closed. More staff have gone. In my electorate, 15 schools are being closed down. More teachers are leaving the district. If you take away the public servants and the salaries they provide to a town the size of Alexandra, you will create a mini-recession within a rural district. Those salaries will be removed from the local traders. If you reduce the number of adults living in a town, you will reduce the number of children living in a town. Hence, you will place further pressure on the schools and start losing more schools. You will get a snowballing effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope my colleague the member for Ballarat does take this message to his Premier of Victoria, Jeffrey Gibb Kennett. I hope my colleague from Ballarat asks Jeffrey Gibb Kennett to ensure that the Dame Pattie Menzies Centre in Alexandra receives the appropriate funding, that the disabled get the proper care they deserve and that the memory of Dame Pattie lives on for much longer. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

He also said that due to the level of outstanding contributions to the regular budget he had stopped making reimbursements to contributors of troops and equipment to peace keeping operations. The UN Secretary-General suggested that Member States in arrears issue bonds which could be taken over by Member States who are owed for troop and equipment reimbursement.

These provisions can be invoked once a Member State's arrears equal or exceed the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two years. At the end of June there were 21 Member States who risked losing their voting rights under the provisions of Article 19 and several more who could be affected if the provisions were interpreted more strictly.</PARA>

Contributors were also advised that the book would appear with United Nations endorsement and that the United Nations reserved a right of review and approval. Authors were advised that it was not the purpose of the book to single out individual countries for criticism. While I agree that it is somewhat over-sensitive of the UN to interpret reference to the Dalai Lama as a criticism of China, I do not consider that the directive was inconsistent with Article 100 given the explicit instructions given to contributors beforehand.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Two companies are presently contracted to carry out surveillance of Australia's northern coastline. Skywest Aviation carries out fixed winged surveillance and Reef Helicopters rotary winged surveillance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The responsibility for the management and coordination of the Civil Coastal Surveillance Program presently lies with Coastwatch, a sub-component of the Australian Customs Service. Defence Force support to the program consists of the provision of 1800 patrol boat days of surface patrol and response capability and 250 hours of P3C Orion air surveillance. Coastwatch also draws on Defence intelligence information and assistance with the planning and conduct of specific surveillance operations.</PARA>
