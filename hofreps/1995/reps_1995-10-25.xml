<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, at the great risk of being repetitious or of telling you what you heard last night, I think I ought to trace over some of the history of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995, particularly the comments that prompted both the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), me and I believe the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) to be anxious to participate in it. Our particular interests focus on the arrangements in this bill to allow horticultural crops, particularly horticultural plantings, to be written off over the life of the planting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was indicated last night, this gesture by the government to allow horticulturalists to write-off new plantings over the life of the planting is a much better situation than the one that currently exists where there is no tax write-off at all for new horticultural plantings. For that reason, the opposition will not be opposing this bill; in fact, we support it and we believe that this is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great concern of those of us in this place who represent horticulturalists is that the bill not only does not go far enough but also sends the wrong signals to both horticulturalists and viticulturalists across Australia. Currently&mdash;you would be aware of this, Mr Speaker, as a result of the comments made last night&mdash;the government has an arrangement where viticulturalists placing vineyard cuttings in the ground in order to create a new vineyard have a tax write-off provided by the government over five years. That tax write-off is a result of negotiations with the wine industry when the government first proposed to increase the wine tax. The wine industry, as part of its consultation with the government, called for these tax write-off provisions. These are in place and they have been widely used by the viticultural industry, as a quick glance at any winegrowing region of Australia will illustrate. You have a vast acceleration in the planting of wine grapes in all regions of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What subsequently followed was a crisis in the horticultural industry, particularly the citrus industry. The horticultural task force under Senator Sherry recommended that precisely the same planting write-off provisions be provided for horticulture as had been provided for viticulture. Horticulturalists and the opposition presumed&mdash;they presumed wrongly as it turns out&mdash;that that was the direction the government was going to take. The direction the government proposes to take is contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), which is currently before the House as part of this cognate debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has proposed that, instead of writing off horticultural crops over five years, as currently exists for viticultural crops, the write-off should commence when the horticultural crop comes into production and should be spread over the estimated commercial life of that particular horticultural crop. I believe that, while this is a step in the right direction, it does not go far enough. Worse than that, it sends the wrong message to all of those in irrigated areas and all of those in viticultural and horticultural areas who are making a decision about what they ought to plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right now there is a real incentive for people to get into vineyard production. As a result, there is a consequent disincentive for people to get into horticultural production. That is counter to what has been the general direction of the government. As I said last night, while it would have been easier for the opposition to criticise the government for its non-interventionist policy, we have not done so over the decade. In fact, we have welcomed it. Here we have the government intervening&mdash;I suspect unwittingly&mdash;in the marketplace by encouraging people to be in viticulture at the expense of horticulture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plea that the member for Cowper has made, the plea that I make and the plea that I would suggest the member for Mallee will make is for the government to look again at this provision and consider offering horticulturalists exactly the same depreciation schedule and tax write-off schedule as currently exists for viticulturalists. Why? Simply because there is very little difference between the cost of establishing a vineyard and a modern horticultural crop. But, even more significantly, there is frankly very little difference in the estimated life of a vine or a fruit tree. Both have a commercial lifespan of about 30 years. I guess it can be extended depending on the nature of the fruit tree or the vine. Both have a lead time; that is, the time that it takes to get into production. In the case of vines, it is probably about three years. For horticultural crops it varies from four years; in the case of stone fruit, to eight years; in the case of crops such as olives; and it goes out to even 10 years in the case of walnuts. So there really is a lead time and a commercial production time for both viticulture and horticulture. It would be appropriate for the government to ensure that the same write-off provisions as exist for viticulture are introduced for horticulture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will say that this has certain revenue implications, and I guess they are right. However, I do not know that the revenue implications need to be all that dramatic. After all, there is already a provision to allow those who are replacing existing horticultural crops with other horticultural crops&mdash;that is, those who are replacing existing trees in a fruit orchard&mdash;to have a write-off for that replacement. What does not exist is a write-off for new expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are great export opportunities in the horticultural industry, just as there are in the viticultural industry. It is fair to say that, in viticulture, the wine industry has been so effective in expanding export markets that its expansion has become the benchmark for other export development in Australia. It is to be commended. But there are opportunities in horticulture that should not be overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said last night, if you look at crops such as the walnut crop or the olive crop&mdash;not crops with which I am familiar&mdash;and at the level of imports of walnuts and olives in one form or another coming into Australia, you see there is great opportunity both for import replacement and export development. The government would be well advised to offer to horticulture precisely the same incentive as it offers to viticulture. It otherwise sends excessively encouraging signals to viticulture at the expense of horticulture. It ought to be taking a crop with export potential, such as the horticultural crop, and saying, `What can we do to offer those who are prepared to invest in this long-term industry real encouragement to do so?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has taken that step in the viticultural industry and taken it successfully, I point out to the Special Minister of State (Mr Johns), who is at the table. As a result, as I have said, the wine industry has become the benchmark for export development. What it is doing with the proposals currently before the House is I think unintentionally, but nonetheless effectively, prejudicing the vineyard industry in favour of the horticultural industry. That is unwise because it means the government is backing what it believes to be a winner but, even more unwisely, it means that the people represented in this chamber by the member for Cowper, the member for Mallee and myself are forced to consider whether or not they will invest in viticulture instead of horticulture when the horticultural crop may show much the same promise, but the government is offering the carrot of tax write-off which tends to mean they will focus on viticulture at the expense of horticulture. I do not believe that direction is in the government's interests or part of what the government intends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My plea is that the government look again at this and consider doing what Senator Sherry originally recommended. Senator Sherry, one of the government's own members, a parliamentary secretary, recommended that in horticulture we should offer the same write-off as currently exists for viticulture. We in the opposition are pleading for that stance from the government in this debate this morning and in continuation of the comments made yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has already indicated that it does not intend to oppose the bill because, as I said in my opening remarks, what is offered is better than nothing and without this bill what the industry gets is nothing. We do not intend to oppose it. We do intend to commit ourselves to offering the level playing field in taxation that we would have expected to appeal to the government and that the constituents we represent were led to believe they would be getting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill fails those constituents. It may well also be failing the Australian economy because it fails to deliver the same sorts of export opportunities in the promising horticultural industry as currently exist in the viticultural industry, which has so successfully performed under the opportunities for export that are being cultivated by the government and, I must say in fairness, even more enthusiastically grasped by the wine industry across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want reflected in horticulture precisely the same opportunities as already exist in viticulture&mdash;not in order to disadvantage the viticultural industry in any way at all but to offer the same encouragement that is given to the horticultural industry and to send the same planting signals to the horticultural industry as have been sent to the viticultural industry. To do anything else runs the risks of unfairly prejudicing one industry against another and of thwarting the market signals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) is quite right. I take this opportunity to place on the public record my concerns about horticulture. These taxation bills which we are debating cognately embrace a whole range of proposals. Like the member for Wakefield, I wish to focus on the tax write-off to horticulture, particularly for new plantings, and to zero in on division 10F as proposed in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). As is the case with the member for Wakefield, horticulture is an important industry in my electorate as it is associated with the irrigation from the Murray River. Hence my keen interest in this matter. A conservative estimate would probably place horticulture as an industry in value terms of probably $200 million per year, just in my electorate. So it is of vital concern to me that artificial distortions will be created by this bill, providing artificial incentives for people in that industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have waited quite a long time for the government's response to the task force recommendations and, whilst I was grateful for that response, I want my concerns placed on the public record in respect of the distortions. Horticulture has been asked to bear quite a lot of pain in the last decade, particularly the dried tree fruit and citrus sectors of the industry. That pain is a result of trade reform. In particular, the citrus industry is bearing the full brunt of that reform and has suffered badly as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The citrus growers in my electorate and that of the member for Wakefield are being asked to restructure, listen to market signals and change the varieties they produce. That requires them to invest. But the signals that this bill sends are tempting them with a carrot to move away from tree plantations to vine plantations. That is not in the best interests of horticulture, which is a broad industry. It is certainly not in the best interests of citrus. If signals like that continue, we are at risk of losing our citrus industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the member for Wakefield, I am grateful for at least a step in the right direction. I am really pleased to see that the wine industry has added its voice to these concerns. It is a sector that would benefit by a greater degree of vine plantation. But even it says that these are not the right signals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Citrus growers today are looking at threats from imported Brazilian concentrate. They have already been sent the very strong signal that producing fruit for the juice market is not their best option. They need to get into a fresh fruit market that requires them to consider new varieties. But citrus is a particularly difficult fruit to grow and investment in new genetic varieties requires a long-term view. To ask these people to consider writing off their capital investment when their crop is produced is to require them to consider that it could be four or five years after their capital investment before they can commence their write-off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was shown some fruit a fortnight ago by citrus growers. They were new varieties which were quite unstable. Some of the fruit was quite grotesque. That is characteristic of the new varieties, which are designed to be ultimately perfect fruit. With the very early fruit&mdash;some of them quite grotesque distortions, the shape of pears&mdash;the only option is the unprofitable juice market. It would take some five or six years after the planting of these new varieties of citrus before anything like decent fruit for the fresh fruit market could be sent to markets looking for perfect fruit. It could even be up to 15 years before a profitable quantity of crop is produced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When my citrus growers see schedule 10F of this bill they are not all that encouraged to consider making a capital investment and to listen to requests to consider restructuring, because there are possibly better options with vines. These are not the correct signals to send. Whilst I am grateful for one small step, further steps will need to be taken to remove these distortions. Like the member for Wakefield, I urge the government to consider taking some further steps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I truly hope that the decisions that have been made in preparing this bill are not revenue driven. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in his second reading speech yesterday stated that an implication of this bill will be a reduction in revenue of $1 million in 1997-98, $2 million in 1998-99 and $4 million in 1999-2000. From this perspective, the government possibly thinks that it has done very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But horticulture deserves that forsaking of revenue by the government, and probably a great deal more than that, because of what it has been asked to bear from the government's trade reforms over the last few years. We as an opposition have supported those reforms&mdash;because tariffs are just another form of tax, a cost to consumers&mdash;as they have been the correct direction to take. But we are talking about industries that have had to bear the full brunt of these reforms and which look for the opportunities to restructure and to compete with rigorous overseas competition. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Nehl" NAMEID="AE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AE4">Mr Nehl</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NV5">Mr FORREST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is my next point. It might be relatively easy for larger producers and larger corporations to absorb the distortions that are being created here, but most citrus and dried fruit producers are small family enterprises on small acreages&mdash;like the ones in my electorate&mdash;who can ill afford to borrow funds, make the investments and then wait many years for the benefits of having those capital costs written off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These producers and corporations, of course, are the ones we are asking to consider restructuring. At present we are asking small family operations to compete with huge conglomerates on the international market. I urge the Assistant Treasurer, who is in the chamber today, to consider taking the next few steps. If they involve revenue reduction implications, I would say that that is only fair, given what the horticulture industry, particularly the dried vine and tree fruit and citrus sectors, has been asked to bear,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Wakefield has mentioned the horticultural task force, and I would like to specifically refer to its recommendation of February 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Industry Commission recommendation that the taxation treatment of expenditure on all new horticultural plantations be revised to provide a more neutral treatment compared with expenditure on other activities. All new horticultural plantings should be treated consistently with the recent Government amendments to the ITAA to allow the costs of acquisition and planting of grape vines to be written off over 4 years from the time of planting.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the key signal to send to prevent those horticulturalists involved with orchards, the growing of trees, from being tempted to move across to vine production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituents have waited a long time for the implementation of these task force recommendations. As I said, I am grateful for at least this small first step. But I have to advise that problems will be created, and it will be incumbent on the government to deal with them. The opposition, when we are next in government, will certainly be committed to removing these distortions and installing the level playing field that the member for Wakefield has referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax treatment for horticultural expenses creates a bias towards investing in vineyards. When a write-off is not available until year five and six and then the maximum write-off period is, say, over 14 years, the length of time before the cost of a plantation is written off may well be far too excessive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thinking ahead to what the international market signals are going to be is like anticipating a movable feast. I know that in the stone fruit industry research activity and market intelligence need to look about seven, eight and even 10 years ahead. Trying to determine, with a crystal ball at your disposal, what market signals are going to be given by consumers, particularly in Asia, what the requirements are going to be and what style of fruit will be required 10 years ahead requires an enormous step in confidence from a producer who as a result, will have to remove a variety that he thinks is not going to be suitable in that time span and then plant another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It takes an enormous amount of confidence for a grower to do that and face the prospect of a proportion of his acreage not producing, thereby reducing his cash flow for such a long time span. I think it would be perfectly normal for anybody in that position to make the decision and say, `I may as well become a wine grape grower rather than invest in a long-term industry.' These are not the right signals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large number of my primary producers are very concerned about these distortions. One of these sectors is represented by the Australian Dried Fruits Association. These are people who produce crop from vines, and even they are saying the decisions in this bill are not in the best interests of broad horticulture. The Australian Dried Fruits Association represents the interests of 4,000 vine fruit and tree fruit growers and believes that the new depreciation provisions will lead to a mis-allocation of resources in Australian horticultural industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expenditure incurred in the establishment of new vineyards is fully deductible over a four-year period. As I have said, this is not the correct signal, and those involved are very concerned about this. The imbalance that could result is a dangerous precedent, they advise me. For example, if a grower establishes a new tree fruit plantation, the cost of establishing this plantation will be incurred in year one. However, no assessable income will be produced until some time after that. Dried tree fruit crops can have an economic life of up to 30 years, so the depreciation as a result would only be spread over the latter half of that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new provisions are inconsistent with the federal government's achievement goals of competitive neutrality amongst competing industries in the economy. I do not believe this is an appropriate signal to send. Growers have expressed their concern, and I have been required to place these concerns on the public record. I hope the government is listening to the message that the member for Cowper sent last night and which the member for Wakefield sent today. It is not too late to consider taking the next step. I look forward to the government's positive response to these pleas being made in the chamber today on behalf of horticulture. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank all those who have participated in the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995. A number of points have been raised to which I would like to respond. Firstly, there has been some general criticism of the bill. One criticism is that it is long and complex. In fact, the trust loss measures were pointed to as an example of this complexity. In my second reading speech I pointed out the reasons for the length of the measures. It is always a trade-off between fairness and size. The government is prepared to add a few pages to legislation where that achieves greater fairness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my second reading speech I also explained that the trust measures are written in the new tax law improvement style. For example, you will find that about 10 pages of the bill are devoted to summaries and charts to lead the reader through the measures. The easy-to-read layout of the text also adds to the number of pages. The overall result, however, is to make the legislation easy to read and follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complexity of the amendments to the bill are also pointed out. The government made details of the measures available with the budget announcements and, as always with these measures, the government has continued to receive representations on the bill. The government has made every effort to provide the legislation as early as practicable and will also continue to examine representations made and to respond where necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in the debate on a different bill earlier this week, we would be delinquent if we did not listen to the concerns of taxpayers when they get to see the bill, its fine detail and the second reading speech. If they were to make representations to us, of course we must take account of that, and sometimes this leads to amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in the bill are at times fairly complex, but this is because they deal with very complex situations. The measures relating to demutualisation of mutual insurance companies are a good example of this. We, as well as insurance companies, agree the amendments deal with very complex situations. The government has received further industry representation on these measures, and these will be examined and remedies will be worked out where necessary. The government has always been willing to listen to and resolve genuine taxpayer concerns, and that has happened once again in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the retrospective application of capital gains tax to non-residents who sell taxable Australian assets, it is quite clear that parliament intended to subject to capital gains tax disposals of taxable Australian assets by non-residents. Taxable Australian assets include shares in private companies and holdings of 10 per cent or more in public companies. It is argued that sales of these shares are exempt from capital gains tax because they are used to produce income from dividends that are subject to withholding tax or exempt from withholding tax because they are franked dividends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would mean that non-residents would not be subject to capital gains tax on the sale of any of these shares. It would make the provision relating to shares being taxable Australian assets meaningless. It is a general rule of statutory interpretation that parliament does not enact legislation that is superfluous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the amendment is made prospective, non-residents who pay tax on the sales of these shares would claim refunds of these taxes. This would lead to a loss of revenue already collected on a fair interpretation of the law. If this retrospective amendment is not made, the effect will be to levy capital gains tax on only Australian residents who sell shares in companies. Foreigners would be free to dispute liabilities for this tax. For those reasons, it would be unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A question also asked was why the same business test will not apply to trusts other than listed widely held trusts. Trusts are generally investment vehicles. Some of these trusts are treated as not carrying on a business. The same business test cannot apply to these trusts. If a trust is treated as carrying on a business, it will generally always carry on a business of investment. The same business test cannot therefore apply in any meaningful way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Family trusts are provided concessional treatment in carrying forward losses. They can generally carry forward losses so long as members of the same family are the only persons who can benefit from the trust. It is therefore not necessary to provide the same business test for these trusts. Family trusts could sell the trust assets. Trust losses will continue to be available to the former trusts. These losses could be used to offset future income of the trust so long as the same family benefits from the trust. It would not be appropriate to apply the same business test in these cases. Moreover, a purchaser will not buy a part of a discretionary interest in a trust. The trust will be bought over in full. In these cases, it will not be appropriate to carry forward trust losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the compliance cost of the trust measures for losses compared with the company loss provisions. A complaint made was that different rules apply to different categories of trusts. It was said that this adds to compliance costs and complexity. The fact is that there are various categories of trusts. These differ markedly from each other and different tax rules are provided to reduce compliance costs. Some of these were the result of consultation with the trust industry. An example of the effort made to reduce compliance costs of the measures is the concessional treatment provided to family trusts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A question was raised on the denial of franking credits for international profit misallocation. The proposed measures seek to ensure that franking credits in certain circumstances cannot be used to largely negate the additional company tax payable as a result of an adjustment to correct international profit shifting or misallocation. In providing franking credits, the imputation system for company taxation is seeking to relieve a second tier of tax on company profits&mdash;that is, where tax is being paid at the company level, profits, when distributed to shareholders as dividends, carry a rebate for the tax paid at the company level if the shareholder is a resident or, if the shareholder is a non-resident, they are not required to pay dividend withholding tax on those franked dividends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where international profit shifting or misallocation has occurred, the profits have in effect already been distributed to an offshore entity without suffering any second tier of tax. Therefore, there is no need for relief by way of a franking credit. In giving a franking credit in these circumstances, companies which have engaged in international profit shifting or misallocation may distribute other profits in a tax free form where those profits have not suffered tax at the company level. This places these companies in a more favourable position than Australian companies which have complied with arms-length standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also concern expressed about the proposed measures applying to original and amended assessments irrespective of the income year to which the misallocation of profit adjustment relates. As the proposed measure seeks to ensure that revenue is not lost by the conferring of an unintended benefit which is inconsistent with the basic policy of imputation&mdash;that is, the company dividend suffers tax at one level: either at the company level or in the hands of the shareholder upon distribution&mdash;it is quite appropriate to apply to assessments which issue after the budget announcement on 9 May 1995, irrespective of the income year to which the misallocation of profit adjustment relates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a claim that the proposed measure will impact unfairly on Australian multinational groups. Claims that the proposed measures will impact unfairly on Australian multinationals are based on a flawed assumption&mdash;namely, that profit shifted from Australia through transfer pricing or non-arms-length dealings will be returned to Australia as dividends or realised as a capital gain on the disposal of shares in a foreign subsidiary. This assumption is flawed because there is little certainty if or when profits will be repatriated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is highly unlikely, for instance, that profits shifted from an Australian resident subsidiary to its foreign parent will be returned to Australia. Even in cases involving profit shifted from an Australian resident parent company to a wholly owned subsidiary, there is no certainty if, when or to what extent the shifted profits may be returned to Australia. It is also unclear how shifted profits could in practice be returned to Australian resident companies to put them in the same position as would have existed if the dealings in question had been undertaken on an arms-length basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A table was handed out by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) allegedly demonstrating the harsh operation of the proposed measures to deny franking credits for international profit misallocation adjustments. The proposed measures will not, in the proposed situation outlined in that table, alter the tax situation of the shareholder taxpayer. The taxpayer on the $3 million profits under the new measure will remain the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that an amendment that would retrospectively deny life insurance companies both a tax rebate and imputation credit is unfair, while receiving both a deduction and a rebate in relation to the imputation credit attached to a dividend amounts to double dipping. It is clearly contrary to the intention of the dividend imputation system. This would have been known by the institutional taxpayers affected by this amendment&mdash;that is, the life insurance companies and their tax advisers. Those companies that did claim both a rebate and a deduction for the same amount would have gained an unconscionable commercial benefit over their competitors who did not exploit the defect. Therefore, it is appropriate for the amendments to be retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the question was asked: why has the government not addressed another defect in the dividend imputation provisions relating to life companies? The corrective amendments already in this bill were inserted because they were relatively simple and could be made within the legislative deadlines that existed at the time. The other alleged defect is more complicated and also applies to superannuation funds. Time prevented this issue from being fully considered and any remedial legislative amendments being included in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, according to representations made by the life insurance industry, life companies have been adopting a proposed interpretation of the law so that no life company has been disadvantaged by the alleged defect. This suggests that the urgency for an amendment is not as profound as the other corrective amendments that have been included in this bill. It is interesting to note that this proposed approach to interpretation is inconsistent with claims of some members of the life insurance industry that, when the defect operates in their favour, they ought to be able to rely on the plain wording of the act, even though this produces a clearly unintended result. </PARA>

I think there is something wrong with the procedure we now adopt whereby the first reading is made and that is all there is to it.

<PARA>This amendment relates to non-residents and taxable Australian assets. The reason why the amendment is being moved is because we believe that the legislation offends against the principle of retrospectivity. I should say that it is not only in relation to these particular provisions but also in some other provisions of the legislation itself that retrospectivity is offended against by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle of retrospectivity has been well set out by the courts of this country. It is a principle which is understood and ought to be understood by governments&mdash;that is, where they take actions which can penalise citizens of the country, then those actions ought not be retrospective. As Mr Justice Wells said in his often quoted judgment in the case of Heading v. Elston in 1980:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[The statutory presumption against retrospectivity] rests upon the well nigh universal conviction that, if members of a community are expected and encouraged, as they are, to govern their conduct by reference to the laws in force in the community, it would be unfair to penalise someone for conduct that was not contrary to the law at the time when he committed himself to it.</PARA>
<PARA>That principle was restated more recently by Justice Deane in the High Court in the case of Heppells v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In cases where tax avoidance is not involved and where the substance of relevant transactions is not concealed by artificialities of form, the basic principles of statutory construction of taxing provisions remain those identified and explained by Justices Rich and Dixon in their judgment in Anderson v. Commission of Taxes (Victoria) in 1937.</PARA>
<PARA>In that case the court said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention to impose a tax or duty or to increase a tax or duty already imposed must be shown by clear and unambiguous language and cannot be inferred from ambiguous words. It is a cardinal principle&mdash;a principle well known to the common law that has not been and ought not be weakened&mdash;namely, that the imposition of a tax must be in plain terms.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Deane went on and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The above principles are supported by strong reasons in both law and commonsense. In circumstances where successive administrations have allowed the Income Tax Assessment Act to become a legislative jungle in which even the non-specialist lawyer and accountant are likely to lose their way in the search to identify the provisions relevant to a particular case. The least that such a taxpayer is entitled to demand of government is that, once the provisions are fully identified, a legislative intent to impose a tax upon him or her in respect of a common place transaction will be expressed in clear words.</PARA>
<PARA>That principle is one which has withstood scrutiny by the higher courts not only of this land but also elsewhere throughout the course of this century. Here we have yet another example of a government saying, `That really was not the intention of the parliament.' The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) relied upon some principle that provision in the act was not meant to be superfluous, as if that principle should override the fundamental principle of retrospectivity in relation to these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If for no other reason than the principle of retrospectivity, we say that the government ought to accept the amendments which have been circulated. They are amendments which are on all footing with what taxpayers and their advisers have understood for a period of time and have acted upon those. They have had no indication to the contrary from the tax office, from the government or from anyone else. Why should the government come in here today and say that we are simply going to turn around something which has been well understood upon any ordinary interpretation of the legislation? I urge the Assistant Treasurer to reconsider his position and accept the amendments. </PARA>

We all remember the retrospective legislation he introduced. We always remember why he introduced it, not because he wanted to but because he was shamed into it on account of the unfairness of the tax system. So don't talk to us about retrospectivity. We understand it. We understand that governments of both political persuasions have done it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak under schedule 2 to item 160(1). It has been said that the government's bill will amend transactions entered into prior to the date of announcement, which of course was budget day on 9 May 1995. I can see no reason why the amendments should not be confined to transactions entered into after the budget announcement. After all, that is typical for application of amendments to anti-avoidance provisions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Typically, the amendments deal with transfer pricing reviews, and transfer pricing reviews take considerable time. The degree of time taken in negotiation between taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office is very considerable indeed. Recognising that these usually involve establishing an arms-length price is not a matter of precision. It involves both sides but particularly the Australian Taxation Office in a fair amount of subjective judgment. It is not uncommon&mdash;in  fact, I suggest that it would be the norm&mdash;for people on both sides of the argument, no matter what their good intentions, to differ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The normal process involves the ATO examining documentation and records of a taxpayer. As part of the process they are expected to do an independent analysis of transfer prices. That process having been followed, the ATO then reaches certain conclusions, I presume, and offers an audit settlement on the basis of a particular price. That offer, typically again, would be examined by the taxpayer and issues are raised and further discussions with the ATO are held. I understand that almost invariably the offer made by the ATO in these circumstances would be modified either as a result of discussion, and therefore voluntary, or after a counter offer is made by the taxpayer. This is a whole process of negotiation. Sometimes agreement is reached after many years of negotiation on a transfer pricing settlement. Even when that happens, the paperwork will not issue for some considerable time after that. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments relate to dividend imputation and, in particular, to the denial of deduction for franking rebates received by a life insurance company via a trust. The amendment here applies retrospectively. There are objections which I raised in the second reading debate in relation to that. For example, the Life Investment and Superannuation Association of Australia noted with disapproval the proposed amendments. They said that in their view any shareholder life company which may have claimed deductions on a correct interpretation of the law as written should not now some five years after the introduction of the provisions be forced to refund the tax applicable to those deductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened here is that from 7 December 1990 the plain wording of the act entitled an ordinary non-mutual life insurance company to the section 160AR deduction. There has been no indication in any bill, act, explanatory memorandum, second reading speech, published ruling or any other determination or public statement from the Australian Taxation Office or any other extrinsic material that it was the intention of the Taxation Office, the government or the parliament that a life insurance company could not claim a deduction which was specifically allowed to it under the legislation. Because a life insurance company is under a statutory fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of its policyholders, it could well have been in breach of that duty if it failed to claim a deduction to which it was entitled under the plain wording of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been pointed out&mdash;I believe the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) is well aware of this&mdash;that at least one life insurance company claimed the deduction and also acted to its detriment by crediting the after tax earnings, including the tax saved, to its 250,000 superannuation policies on a daily basis since 1990. This is not dealing with the situation in which the company or the shareholders benefited from the tax saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these amendments which are proposed in this bill by the government are passed and are retrospective, the company will not be able to recoup any retrospective tax or penalties from a quarter of a million policyholders. Therefore, the company will have to pay the whole of the aggregate amount from its own resources and those of its shareholders. The Australian Taxation Office has known about the deduction claims since at least the end of last year, yet neither the Taxation Office nor the government has given any indication prior to 28 September 1995 when this bill was introduced that the deduction was not intended to be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a situation where the responsibility for the defect&mdash;if there is such a defect&mdash;clearly rests with the tax office and the government. Having regard to the plain wording of the act, a taxpayer cannot be presumed to know what parliament&mdash;let alone the government or the tax office&mdash;intended in the absence of any written indication to the contrary of an intention prior to tabling this bill. For these reasons, the amendments which have been circulated in my name have been moved. We believe that out of any sense of fairness to this situation the government ought to accept the amendments rather than continue with a situation which quite clearly and patently creates major problems for companies. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment relates to research and development. As I indicated in my speech in the second reading debate, research and development syndicates have been a mechanism for funding by research and development companies requiring taxation shelter. Generally, these companies would not spend money on research and development in the absence of a deduction. On the other hand, companies who wish to conduct research development need funds and cannot make use of a tax deduction. A significant source of these research and development projects has come from public and private tax exempt companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments here are aimed at ensuring that consistent tax treatment is forwarded to expenditure, as is the case with expenditure incurred by public tax exempt entities under section 73CB. The amendments apply to expenditure incurred after 7.30 p.m. on 9 May when the measured was announced. Although the transitional rules are slightly more generous than the original transitional rules announced on 9 May, there are problems which have been pointed out because of applications which were on foot and are therefore caught by these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, one researcher alleges that they were led by AusIndustry to believe that their submissions would be considered at a meeting in June. Another person alleges that AusIndustry officials advised all major syndicate arrangers during the lead-up to the May meeting of the TCC that private exempt syndicates would not be considered at the May meeting but the deferral would not affect their right to consideration at a later meeting. Other private tax exempt applications were considered at the May meeting and approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated yesterday, the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney have said that the effect of this bill is that, even though they submitted a research and development syndicate application on 3 May 1995, in accordance with the legislation existing before 9 May, it will not be considered. There are details of other projects where the same complaints are made. For example, in applications relating to research and development in the agricultural sector, there is an indication that the applications were lodged in January 1995, there were approvals in April 1995 in relation to two of these matters, and then the AusIndustry officials advised the parties concerned during the lead-up to the May tax concession committee meeting that private tax exempt syndicates would not be considered at the May meeting but this deferral would not effect their right to consideration at a subsequent meeting. They say that they cooperated with this request expecting that there would be no ultimate disadvantage as a consequence, but now they find that the provisions of the bill will disadvantage these applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major pieces of research are involved. One, as I mentioned, relates to the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute and others relate to major agricultural research. These researchers, having entered into the process of having made the applications and acting in accordance with the rules and the provisions which they understood to be relevant at the time, are now finding that, having gone months through this process, they are cut off at a particular point and the research and development is placed in jeopardy. I hope that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has had an opportunity to look at this more carefully since I raised the matter in the debate at the second reading stage yesterday. These amendments are designed to overcome this disadvantage which these and other researchers will suffer. I again urge the government to accept the amendments that have been circulated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not the researchers that the amendments propose to protect; it is the investors. The opposition proposes to protect the investors who put money into private tax exempt bodies even though that expenditure is not fully at risk. The investors the opposition want to protect will not have entered a syndicate or incurred any expenditure before the government's budget announcement, and any who have are already protected. They will not have entered into contracts to incur the R&amp;D, and any who have are already protected. If a scheme lacks even a preliminary of finance scheme approval, no-one has a legitimate claim to the former research and development exemption. So once again it is not the researchers that are being protected by this; it is the investors. As I said, the investment money is not at risk and therefore should not attract a tax exemption.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is somewhat superfluous to say that the researchers will not be affected, it will only be the investors that will be affected. I am sure the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) understands that the basis of research being carried out is dependent upon the investment funds being available. In relation to two applications which I am referring to, the total estimated cost in preparing and lodging those two applications was around $250,000. Here we are in a country that prides itself on the slogan which your government put forward that, `We ought to be the clever country. We want more investment. We want more saving. We need more research and development.' That research and development is dependent upon investment and investors coming forward and having a clear understanding of the rules and procedures which are to be followed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have investors halfway through the process&mdash;having spent a quarter of a million dollars on two major pieces of research relating to agriculture in Australia, having gone through the lodgment process, having gone through the preliminary process of approval, having gone to AusIndustry, with its blessing&mdash;being told, `No, we will not deal with it at the May meeting of the tax concession committee, but that will not ultimately be of any disadvantage to you.' For the Assistant Treasurer to come in here and say, somewhat superficially, `It doesn't matter, research is not going to be affected' is no way to go about increasing and enhancing research in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that these people have undertaken that process in good faith, on all the advice of the bureaucrats concerned to act in a certain way. The government then turns around overnight and says that it will change the rules, no matter that these people have invested a quarter of a million dollars in applications for research. For the Assistant Treasurer to say, `It is only the investors who are concerned,' is to give a funny answer. On the one hand, he says that research is important; on the other, he is saying not to worry about this because it is only the investors, not researchers, who are losing.

I did say that in the research and development field there is an opportunity for some investors not to take a risk. We give tax deductions when money is at risk. We do that to encourage people to put their money at risk. We do not give tax concessions where an investment is virtually guaranteed. Why would we give a tax deduction for that?

<PARA>The Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill 1995 puts in place the necessary legislative framework for the sale of the Commonwealth government's remaining 50.4 per cent shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, CBA, as announced in the 1995-96 budget on 9 May 1995. The Commonwealth's decision to sell its remaining Commonwealth Bank shareholding reflects the significant changes which have occurred in the Australian financial system since the early 1980s and the changes which have occurred in the Commonwealth Bank since 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deregulation of the financial system, and the increased competition within the Australian banking sector in particular, has significantly weakened the case for majority government ownership of a commercial bank. The Australian banking sector today is significantly more competitive, efficient and responsive to the needs of consumers and the Australian economy in general than was the case when this government came to office in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this environment, the government decided in the budget preparation process this year that there was no longer any compelling reason for it to continue to hold a majority shareholding of a commercial bank. This was a change in the policy I announced in September 1993 that the government had no intention to further reduce its shareholding. I made that announcement in the prospectus for the public share offer of approximately 19 per cent of the bank's shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of that second public share offer, which increased private ownership of the bank to 49.6 per cent, played a role in changing our minds about the government maintaining majority ownership of a commercial bank. Despite being the majority shareholder, it has been the government's longstanding policy not to interfere in the commercial operations of the Commonwealth Bank. The bank operates on a fully commercial basis and has a proven track record as a successful bank operating in a very competitive industry and yielding good returns to its shareholders. This has been reflected in strong investor support for the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background, in the budget deliberations we considered the clear budgetary advantages of selling the government's remaining 50.4 per cent stake. The sale will make a major contribution to the reduction of outstanding government debt, to the benefit of all Australians. The sale should allow public debt interest savings of around $400 million per annum once the bank is fully sold. Our decision to sell the government's shares will also provide an excellent opportunity for small investors to buy into the bank. The bank's management has welcomed the sale, saying the decision will allow the bank to pursue its development with clarity of purpose and that the sale of the shares will be in the long-term interests of existing shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to the details of the bill. The Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill 1995 provides:</PARA>
<PARA>.the necessary amendments to the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 to facilitate the sale of the Commonwealth's CBA shareholding;</PARA>
<PARA>.detailed transitional arrangements for the Commonwealth guarantee of the liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Bank Officers Superannuation Corporation&mdash;CBOSC&mdash;and an on-going Commonwealth guarantee of the liabilities of the Commonwealth Development Bank, the CDB;</PARA>
<PARA>.for the conversion of the CDB and the CBOSC from statutory authorities to Corporations Law companies and for the conversion of the statutory superannuation fund of the CBOSC to a trust;</PARA>
<PARA>.that the Commonwealth Bank body, which includes the CBA and its subsidiaries, will be, as far as practicable, subject to legislation after the sale, consistent with other private sector companies and approved banks;</PARA>
<PARA>.that the Commonwealth Bank body and its shareholders are not disadvantaged under section 63A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as a result of the change in ownership resulting from the sale of the Commonwealth's CBA shares;</PARA>
<PARA>.that the CBA and the CDB will be provided with appropriate transitional arrangements regarding protected business names;</PARA>
<PARA>.for the retention, post sale, of employee entitlements accrued in pre-sale service under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973; and</PARA>
<PARA>.the necessary consequential amendments to other Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I will elaborate on some of those points. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides appropriate transitional measures for the Commonwealth guarantee applying to the CBA's liabilities consistent with my budget night announcement. These arrangements ensure that the CBA's depositors, creditors and superannuation fund members are treated fairly as a result of the Commonwealth's sale of its shares. The arrangements are broadly comparable with those applying to the sale of the State Bank of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transitional arrangements relating to the Commonwealth guarantee of the liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank and the CBOSC commence at the `effective date', which is defined as the time at which the Commonwealth's CBA shareholding falls to below 50 per cent, or 9 May 1996, whichever is the later. The transitional period for which the guarantee applies depends upon whether the liability is a demand deposit, a term deposit or any other liability. </PARA>
<PARA>The transitional arrangements provide for:</PARA>
<PARA>.the guarantee of all demand deposits for a period of three years from the effective date;</PARA>
<PARA>.the guarantee, until maturity, of term deposits outstanding at the effective date or made during the three years following the effective date; and</PARA>
<PARA>.the guarantee, until maturity, of all other liabilities and off-balance sheet obligations outstanding at the effective date. </PARA>
<PARA>The bill provides that the Commonwealth will continue to guarantee all of the liabilities of the CDB as is currently the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides that the Commonwealth will guarantee the liabilities of the CBOSC&mdash;or the superannuation fund&mdash;for a person who was a member, retired member or beneficiary before the commencement of the relevant provisions of the act. This section preserves for these persons the guarantee currently contained in the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank are to negotiate appropriate accountability arrangements relating to the Commonwealth guarantee of the liabilities of the CBA, CBOSC and the CDB.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Taxation Issues</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides an exemption from the possible application of section 63A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 relating to the deductibility of losses on bad debts. This provision seeks to ensure that the Commonwealth Bank body and its shareholders are not disadvantaged as a result of the change in ownership resulting from the sale of the Commonwealth's shares. This is irrespective of whether the sale is structured in such a way that an intermediary or intermediaries are interposed between the Commonwealth as seller and the buyers of the Commonwealth's shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also exempts various transactions associated with the sale of the Commonwealth's CBA shares from most state and territory taxes, levies, fees, duties and charges. This measure is intended to enhance the attractiveness of the sale to potential purchasers. The Commonwealth, however, has indicated its in-principle support for providing relevant states and territories with an ex gratia payment compensating them for stamp duty forgone in relation to the sale. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Foreign Ownership</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does not impose any legislative restrictions on the ability of foreign interests to acquire shares in the Commonwealth Bank. Post-sale, the CBA will be subject to the same foreign investment regulatory framework that applies to other Australian banks. International investors will be permitted to participate in the public sale of CBA shares, as was the case in the 1993 sale. Foreign participation will expand the market for the CBA's shares, which is in the interests of all shareholders. It would be pointless to deny such participation when foreign investors can buy CBA shares on the Australian Stock Exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Commonwealth Bank will remain predominantly Australian owned immediately after the sale and will have a dispersed share ownership given the application of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, the Banks (Shareholdings) Act 1972 and the allocation policy which is expected to apply for foreign investor participation in the sale. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Future of the Commonwealth Development Bank</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed sale arrangements not only provide for the retention of the Commonwealth Development Bank, with its existing charter and the Commonwealth guarantee of its liabilities, but will also enhance the CDB as an independent financial institution aimed at providing specialist banking services to the small business and rural sectors. The CDB will continue to be 91.9 per cent owned by the Commonwealth Bank and 8.1 per cent owned by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will continue to pay an annual subsidy to the CDB to undertake the banking activities defined in its charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the conversion of the CDB from a statutory authority to a public company under the Corporations Law with its own memorandum and articles of association. The CDB's existing charter will be removed from the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 and replicated in the CDB's memorandum of association. The conversion of the CDB to a public company with its own board of directors will enhance its position as a specialist financial institution. This is consistent with the proposed granting of a separate banking authority to the CDB. </PARA>

<PARA>The second reading speech of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill was notable for what it left out rather than for what information it gave us. For instance, I refer to his statement that the shareholders agreement will be made available when it is finalised. I relate that to part 1 of my amendment, which says that the agreement should indeed be made a schedule to the bill. But more of that in the body of my speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also find it interesting that&mdash;in dealing with such an important bill, for which we have been waiting for five months and we are given five days notice once it was introduced to consider it and to debate it today; in other words, we get one day of consideration for every month we have waited&mdash;the sum total of the contribution the Treasurer is able to make is 11 minutes of speech. That is not good enough, Treasurer. As I said, we have been waiting for this bill for 11 long months. It was published in the budget session&mdash;that is, last May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was said by the bank, when responding to the announcement that the remainder of the Commonwealth's holding was to be sold, that a debate on the bill in May would `be helpful to the maintenance of an orderly market for the bank shares and certainty of the sale and buyback process'. But, as I have often said during that long waiting period, the Commonwealth Bank sale was just another classic case of policy on the run. There was no proper planning and no proper consideration of the implications for things such as the Commonwealth Development Bank. Your speech, Minister, did nothing to allay the fears of those people who have looked at the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scenario in which this was introduced was a very simple one: the government had planned to sell off the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS>, start the breakup of Telstra&mdash;flog it off. Then they changed their mind and decided that, no, they could not do that, after talking to Telstra. So, instead, to fill the great gaping hole in their budget, where they had planned for a $5.3 billion sale of assets which they would spend immediately on recurrent expenditure to give us a supposed surplus, they said, `Wow! Let's sell the Commonwealth Bank.' I think the cabinet was told a number of hours before the decision was announced. The caucus, however, did not get to hear of it until only minutes before the announcement was to be made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Too late, as my colleague says; quite  right. It was too late so that they could not mount a reaction to the proposed sale. Then there was the caucus meeting the other day to finally approve of this bill. I think it was carried by only six votes&mdash;hardly a resounding endorsement of your policy. Again it is quite indicative on today's speaking list in that there is you, Minister, and the poor old member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), whom you trot out at any time when there is desperation in the ranks. I think we have 10 speakers on the list. However, we will be able to vote on our motion, so we will give those people who spoke out so firmly and so fervently at your caucus meeting the opportunity to vote against the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just like to remind the Treasurer of his own promises that he made, when he was the Minister for Finance, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program back in August 1992, when he was having a little interview with Laurie Oakes. Laurie Oakes said to him, `There's nothing to stop you now selling the Commonwealth Bank in the same way,' referring to the previous part sale. Ralph Willis, the good Treasurer, said, `We won't be selling the Commonwealth Bank any further.' Laurie Oakes said, `But you could, could you not?' Ralph Willis said, `We're not intending to.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then in September 1993 Mr Willis reaffirmed this strong position he had taken in relation to the government's commitment not to reduce the Commonwealth's holding in the Commonwealth Bank. In a letter, which was then included in the prospectus for the sale of the second tranche, Mr Willis assured prospective investors and said, `The government has no intentions whatsoever of further reducing its shareholding.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Keating government have long been characterised by misleading statements promising the Australian people one thing and doing precisely the opposite without any concern for what they have said in the past or what impact it may have on things for the future. This government's track record is one of broken promises and it is known widely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is immaterial whether you are talking about l-a-w law tax cuts, the promise not to increase the Medicare levy, the sale of Qantas, the privatisation of federal airports or the privatisation of Telstra; what is consistent in all these cases is the government's deception of the Australian people. At every opportunity this government twists and manipulates the truth in a cynical attempt to retain power at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So watch for the election. It is going to be peppered. It is going to be featuring dirty tactics by the government  the like of which I do not think this country has yet seen. This is a morally bankrupt government and their spectacular reversal on the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank simply confirms it, and indeed is a precursor to their intention to sell Telstra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look further at their announcements. The government said that they would sell off the rest of the bank in two tranches and have a share buyback of government shares only&mdash;not on offer to ordinary mum and dad type shareholders&mdash;that would take up $1 billion of the bank's money. And they would do all this by legislation and not need a shareholders meeting. Following a statement by Mr Willis to the bank, who wrote to all shareholders on 12 May, all shareholders were informed that there would not be a need for a shareholders meeting. This was duly reported by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 25 May 1995, saying that the government would do it all by legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, in clause 20, refers to the buyback, albeit indirectly. Historically, I think it is important to look at the bank's initial response to the proposal of both the sale and the buyback. Their first reaction was recorded on 9 May in a media release. That release was very cautious on the buyback option and listed a number of conditions which must be met before they would be agreeable to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relevantly, the conditions included an independent expert report and shareholders approvals, including special resolution, required by the Corporations Law or the Australian Stock Exchange listing rules or considered necessary by the board of the bank, for matters such as: any selective buyback; any necessary amendments to the bank's memorandum and articles of association which remove all special rights to the Commonwealth, apart from its right to appoint a director; dealings with the bank's majority shareholder; and any necessary approvals from regulatory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other conditions were that the bank and the government reach agreement on acceptable transition arrangements for the Commonwealth guarantee of the bank's liabilities and, importantly, that the bank and the government reach agreement on the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank. This is certainly not met. The explanatory memorandum sets out very clearly that the future of the bank remains undecided. The bank added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The board of the bank believes consideration of legislation by the parliament in the budget session would be helpful for the maintenance of an orderly market for the bank's shares and the certainty of the sale and buyback process.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, we certainly did not get that, did we? Here we are, five months later, and we are given five days notice for consideration of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, I think it is important to examine the condition the bank put on their tacit approval to the plans of the government; that was, the important point that there needed to be agreement reached between the Commonwealth and the bank on the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Development Bank is the bank for little people. It is for farmers. It is for small business people. It is for people who cannot get money elsewhere. It has a special charter in the Commonwealth Banks Act presently which tells the Commonwealth Bank how it must carry out those lending procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, as stated in a document of 1993, Mr Keating's piggery group of companies had a loan of in excess of $2 million from the Commonwealth Development Bank. I think there is an obligation on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to explain to us how he was perceived to be a needy client or to be meeting the criteria of the charter to get the loan. But, of course, we have a very rich Prime Minister who does not share with us where he gets his money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the conversion of the Commonwealth Development Bank into a company limited by shares under the Corporations Law with the name Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia Ltd. The share capital of the Commonwealth Development Bank will continue to be 91.9 per cent owned by the Commonwealth Bank and 8.1 per cent owned by the Commonwealth, as is currently the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank&mdash;that is the one that is now in legislation&mdash;provides finance, where it would not otherwise be available, on reasonable or suitable terms and conditions, having regard primarily to cash flow and prospects rather than security so that its focus is on development. That charter is no longer to be enshrined in law; it is to be placed in the memorandum of association of the new Commonwealth Development Bank Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the explanatory memorandum states, in relation to that agreement, `The bill does not define the future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank'. As I said, this is the bank that little people need to rely upon. The Commonwealth Development Bank's existing charter as defined will be repealed and replaced, as I said, in the memorandum. It further states, `The Commonwealth will continue to pay an annual subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank to undertake the banking activities defined in its charter.' But it does not define what this subsidy arrangement will be. This, again, is left to be defined in the shareholders agreement to be entered into between the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank before the transfer time. The transfer time is defined in the legislation as `the time at which the Commonwealth ceases to have the status of being the holder of more than 50 per cent of the shares in the bank'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that this does not meet the important condition for the board to consider a buyback, as set out in the board's media release of 9 May. If a buyback takes place, as foreshadowed in the bill, it means that the board has been rolled by the government into submission at the expense of ordinary shareholders as well small business and rural and export sectors which are dependent on the venture capital for which that Commonwealth Development Bank is unique. Indeed, the stage is set for the demise of the Commonwealth Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, the government is not bound to continue the subsidy. The bank in its 1995 report, which is yet to be tabled, uses words similar to those used in its last year's report&mdash;that it requires the subsidy to successfully carry out the charter. Specifically in the report yet to be tabled, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bank's objective remains to achieve a proper commercial balance between the consequences of the charter and the size of any subsidy received in support of it.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Commonwealth Bank is saying in its report that it relies on the subsidy to carry out the charter&mdash;not on the guarantee. Let us have a look in more detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum states that the shareholders agreement is to be entered into between the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank and it will provide for the existing charter, as currently defined in the sections which are to be repealed by the legislation. The existing statutory provisions are to be replaced in the terms of the shareholders agreement, as I have said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 74A of the Commonwealth Bank Act 1959, which currently provides for a capital injection by the Commonwealth to the Commonwealth Development Bank, is also being repealed by item 27 of the schedule to the bill. The 1994 annual report of the Commonwealth Bank states that, in consequence of this amendment to the Commonwealth Bank Act 1959, there was to be an injection of $30 million to the capital of the Commonwealth Development Bank, which resulted in the Commonwealth having its holding of 8.1 per cent of issued capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 85A of the Commonwealth Bank Act, which provides for the grant of financial assistance to the Commonwealth Development Bank by the Commonwealth, is being repealed by item 29 of the schedule. The 1994 annual report records that the Commonwealth Development Bank received a subsidy of $20 million to the year ended 30 June 1994, and the budget papers for 1995-96 show that the sum of $20.6 million has been provided for payment of subsidies to the Commonwealth Bank for the year ended 30 June 1996. In view of the significant role played by the Commonwealth Development Bank for small business and the rural and export sectors, it is amazing that the government should attempt to rush through a bill for the sale of its shares in the Commonwealth Bank without laying bare its agenda for the Commonwealth Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's poor planning is only matched by its ineptitude and policy somersaults in attempting to effect the sale of the shares of the AIDC Ltd where its current policy is to acquire the minority shares disregarding its policy on full privatisation for the AIDC. No thought seems to have been given by the government to the question of whether the activities of the AIDC Ltd and those of the Commonwealth Development Bank could not have been brought under the one umbrella organisation. This would release the Commonwealth Bank of carrying out the public authority functions of the Commonwealth Development Bank on the basis of a Commonwealth subsidy promised in a shareholders agreement, notwithstanding that section 74C of the bill makes the point that the Commonwealth Development Bank, when restructured after the enactment of the bill, is not to be taken to be a Commonwealth authority or Commonwealth company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board of the Commonwealth Bank must indeed be disappointed that its expectations for a firm policy stance of the Commonwealth on the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank and its annual subsidy have not be forthcoming in tandem with this bill for the sale of its shares. Under the title `Looking forward' in the 1995 annual report, the bank states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compression of interest margins due to increased competition from commercial banks will continue during 1995-96. To counter this the Development Bank will focus on three key elements of strategy increasing penetration of the small and medium business market, particularly manufacturing and the service sectors with export potential, increasing penetration in rural and major urban areas and reinforcing its role as a specialist bank focusing on clients' prospects for success in business. However, as noted at page 5, the future of the Development Bank is currently the subject of a review by government. The bank's objective remains to achieve a proper commercial balance between the consequences of the charter and the size of any subsidy received in support of it.</PARA>
<PARA>Thus when the explanatory memorandum states that the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank will be retained in the memorandum of the Commonwealth Development Bank, coupled with the repeal of section 85A, providing financial assistance to that bank by way of government subsidies, it will in reality be a charter without substance because the memorandum can be amended under the Corporations Law. In the absence of a subsidy, the Commonwealth Development Bank will be compelled to do away with its specialist lending facilities and put all its loans on a strict commercial basis. This will see the end of the special role that it has met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the bill provides in clause 117(2) that the Commonwealth guarantees the due payment by the Commonwealth Development Bank of any amount that is payable by that bank to a person other than the Commonwealth. Despite the existence of the guarantee, it is clear from the stance of the board that it is only prepared to tailor its specialist lending facility to the subsidy and not to the guarantee. There might well be no alternative under the Corporations Law in view of the due diligence obligations of directors of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this bill does, in effect, is enable the Commonwealth to rid itself of the shares to meet its budgetary requirements and saddle a wholly privatised Commonwealth Bank with the Commonwealth Development Bank whose charter is both without substance and lacking the specific terms of subsidy. In the absence of these terms, the directors could revert to the normal commercial terms of lending. As I said, the scene is set for the demise of the Commonwealth Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum does not indicate the terms of the shareholders agreement in so far as the subsidy is concerned. It merely states that the Commonwealth Bank will have an option to purchase the Commonwealth shares in the Commonwealth Development Bank in the event that the Commonwealth decides to sell its shareholding or if an adequate annual Commonwealth subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank was not paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus it must be inferred that the shareholders agreement would not give any definite undertakings binding the Commonwealth to an adequate level of subsidy to enable the directors to carry out the terms of the charter in the memorandum. Further, the door has been left open for the Commonwealth Bank to wind up the operations of the Commonwealth Development Bank based on commercial consideration by acquiring the shares held by the Commonwealth on the grounds that the subsidy is inadequate&mdash;a very neat little plot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum also states that the Commonwealth Bank will not exercise its voting power to amend the memorandum of the Commonwealth Development Bank while an adequate Commonwealth subsidy is in place. But this poses the question: what is an adequate subsidy? With the Commonwealth Development Bank deciding to discharge its fiduciary relationships under the Corporations Law, it again means that the question of adequacy remains simply indeterminate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of the shareholders agreement cannot override the provisions of section 74B(6)(c), which states that nothing in section 74A prevents a change in the structure, memorandum, articles or membership of the Development Bank. In addition, there is no provision in the bill which seeks to override the provisions of the Corporations Law regarding the effecting of amendments to the memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore clear that the terms of the shareholders agreement will be crucial to the continued operations of the Commonwealth Development Bank in serving the present and future needs of small business and rural and export sectors. The government should place before the parliament the terms of the proposed shareholders agreement, including the undertakings in relation to the payment of subsidies, to clarify the future of the Development Bank post privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;as my amendment sets out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of the shareholders agreement will also be of significance to any buyback of shares held by the Commonwealth prior to the sale of the balance of the shares to the public. The buyback will deplete the Commonwealth Bank of funds which might otherwise provide for the Commonwealth Development Bank to discharge any obligations under the charter in its memorandum. Such a withdrawal of funds&mdash;a billion dollars&mdash;if not accompanied by a binding contract by the Commonwealth to pay the Development Bank for carrying out its charter would compound the position for other shareholders in the Commonwealth Bank. The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1995 inserted a new share buyback provision in division 4B. The section which did this, section 206A, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These rules are designed to protect the interests of shareholders and creditors by:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)addressing the risk of buy-back activity leading to the company's insolvency</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)seeking to ensure fairness between the company's shareholders</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)requiring the company to disclose all material information.</PARA>
<PARA>Although the bill foreshadows the possibility of a buyback, it does not spell out the details. Advice I received from the bank today confirms that a selective buyback will take place and that the necessary extraordinary general meeting of shareholders will in fact take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is wise to observe that, in the new simplification law, there is a provision for exempting the need to have a shareholders meeting and that would be gained from the Australian Securities Commission. Therefore, it is necessary to address that point, particularly with the need to provide for just terms for any acquisition of property in accordance with section 51(xxxi) of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the provisions of the shareholders meeting, the Commonwealth, as an interested party, will not be able to vote, and it is necessary for a majority of 75 per cent of the remaining 49 per cent of private shareholders in the bank to vote in favour of the proposal. But having regard to the needs of mums and dads&mdash;who comprise the majority of the dispersed share ownership, other than the Commonwealth&mdash;it is necessary that their interests are protected in a buyback which may circumvent that approval. It is relevant to note that in the prospectus to the secondary share offer of 178 million shares on 24 September 1993, the government said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also possible for the government to initiate amendments to legislation which, if enacted by the Australian parliament, could reduce its role or increase it.</PARA>
<PARA>There were two roles for the government to play&mdash;one, the majority shareholder and, two, the guarantor. The prospectus also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The completion of the offer will not affect the current guarantee of all moneys owed by the Commonwealth Bank, as guarantee is made pursuant to section 117 of the bank's act as amended.</PARA>
<PARA>The only problem is that, with the final privatisation, that guarantee will go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prospectus also stated categorically that on completion of the offer the only change would occur in the reduction of the Commonwealth shareholding, which would not be less than 50.1 per cent. Again and again there are undertakings given to people who become shareholders that the government would remain a shareholder and, indeed, a majority shareholder and that the guarantee would remain in place. The government should provide undertakings that any buy-back, whether put to a meeting of the shareholders under section 206E(1) of the Corporations Law or whether granted exemption on terms to be set out by the Australian Securities Commission under section 206E(4) of the Corporations Law, must be on just terms in accordance with section 51(xxxi) of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two other matters that I want to briefly deal with in the time that remains are the question of restrictions on foreign ownership and the important question of regulations, because clause 19 of the bill we are debating allows regulations to be made with a retrospective effect. Very simply on the restriction of foreign ownership under the legislation which remains in place&mdash;there are various acts that affect this&mdash;the aggregate foreign investment  permissible under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act is 40 per cent. Foreign acquisitions beyond this trigger the aggregate control interest provisions requiring foreign investors and the bank to notify the Foreign Investment Review Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Individual shareholding under the Banks (Shareholdings) Act is 10 per cent. Subsection 10(1) says that the Treasurer can give an exemption up to 15 per cent. But, once again, nothing has been learned from the Qantas privatisation, where every remedy to overcome a problem where the shareholding foreign ownership goes over the required limits is all retrospective. There is no plan in the legislation to prevent its happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of regulations, which I again address in my amendments, clause 19 enables regulations to be made regarding any savings or transitional matters arising out the Commonwealth's sale of its shares in the bank or related matters arising out of an enactment of the bill. Subclause 19(3) states that regulations can take effect retrospectively but not earlier than the transfer time. If a share buy-back takes place as a first step in the sale process, as is to be expected, the transfer time will coincide with the buy-back and the regulations could therefore cover the buy-back. The explanatory memorandum justifies the need for retrospectivity on the basis that regulations relating to savings and transitional matters may not be able to commence before the date they are notified in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, thereby potentially frustrating the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not clear whether the commercial considerations require the need for retrospectivity of regulations, which is achieved by providing that the provisions of 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act do not apply to these regulations made pursuant to section 19 and take effect on or after the transfer time. The possibility that regulations may cover the buy-back is an additional reason for making provision that any acquisition of property in consequence of the buy-back be on just terms under section 51(xxxi) of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, whilst not denying the bill its second reading in this House, I urge the House to support my amendment because once again we are seeing three things happen in relation to lack of planning: firstly, lack of planning means that the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank is now at the very best uncertain; secondly, lack of planning as to how the facility for small business and rural and export manufacturers could have been addressed by using the AIDC; and, thirdly, lack of planning so that we have to have retrospectivity with regard to the regulations and a backflip with regard to the need to hold a shareholders meeting when the government maintained it could all be done by legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the edification of the member for Wide Bay, let me give some of the history. On 16 August 1947, following a meeting of the federal Labor cabinet, the then Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, issued the following 43-word statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cabinet today authorised the Attorney-General, Dr Evatt, and myself to prepare legislation for submission to the federal parliamentary Labor Party for the nationalisation of banking other than state banks with proper protection for the shareholders, depositors, borrowers and staffs of private banks.</PARA>
<PARA>This legislation before the House today completes the denationalisation of the Commonwealth Bank. In this regard, I am sure some members, including the member for Wills, will say that the legislation is contrary to Labor tradition and, as such, it should be opposed. I am very strongly convinced that the legislation is consistent with Labor Party traditions&mdash;those that emphasise goals instead of methods and those that emphasise ends instead of means. It raises the issue of party tradition and its relevance to contemporary policy making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is self-evident that tradition should never be seen as an end in itself. Tradition is at its most useful when it is guiding the goals and objectives of a party and is not leading to confusion between goals and methods or between ends and means. I maintain that the Labor Party's goals in 1995 are no different from those in 1947. We still want a more equal, a more tolerant and a more independent Australia. We still want the public sector to play a liberating and equalising role in our society. It is just that our methods, our means and our policy tools throughout this period have sensibly changed in response to social and economic changes not just here in Australia but throughout the civilised world. There is no sense in clinging to tradition for tradition's sake. There is no sense in clinging to tradition if the very purpose of the traditional approach to policy has changed, and I want to demonstrate this point in two ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, I want to talk about Chifley's proposal for bank nationalisation. Let us go behind the romance of the history. Let us go behind the myth making that has been so prominent from that period. Chifley's nationalisation announcement was in response to a decision by the High Court of Australia to declare constitutionally invalid the government's banking bills. The purpose of those bills was to regulate and to supervise the operation of private banks to ensure, as much as possible, they operated in the public interest. Those things are already in place. Ironically, those things were achieved by the banking legislation of the Menzies government in the 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a licensing system for private banks, which was one of Chifley's purposes. We have minimum deposits that need to be held by the private banks. I refer to page 40 of the recent annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with internationally accepted standards, Australian banks are required to maintain risk weighted capital ratios of at least eight per cent including at least four per cent in the form of tier 1 or core capital which comprises items such as ordinary shares and retained earnings and provides depositors with the surest protection against losses.</PARA>
<PARA>There is absolutely no doubt that the central purpose of Chifley's legislation with regard to the supervision of private banks is in place. It is supported, I would assume, on both sides of the House. There is no dispute about these matters. The recent report of the Reserve Bank also refers to developments in supervision. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prudential supervision of banks continues to evolve in response to local and international developments. Major activities during the past decade have focused on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) ensuring that banks maintain capital buffers commensurate with the risk in their business</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) encouraging banks to establish and maintain sound risk management systems and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) strengthening mechanisms for the early detection of potential problems.</PARA>
<PARA>The regulations are in place. The public risks are being covered. This raises the point of the need for vigilance with regard to bank regulation. I know many members have been concerned about fees and charges. This is an area where the government needs to take a strong hand. Regulations and legislation need to be closely examined. We need to recognise that banking in the 1990s is an essential part of life. People cannot survive these days without banking, just as they cannot survive without food, clothing or shelter. There is room for a government mandated approach, room for legislation which provides a basic low cost package in the banking sector. Regulations are in place already, but there is always the need to update the approach across time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The core lesson of this is that governments do not have to own banks to govern their operations; they do not have to own banks to supervise the operations of the banking sector. No-one in this House&mdash;absolutely no member of this parliament&mdash;can pretend that in recent years the Commonwealth Bank, with its commercial charter, has operated any differently, any more in the public interest, than the private banking sector. One only needs to look at the record on fees and charges to find the best proof of that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to Chifley's nationalisation announcement. The second purpose of that proposition was to establish a central bank function to ensure government control of monetary policy. This was a logical response at the end of the 1940s to the establishment of the Bretton Woods agreement for fixed exchange rates and the establishment of a new world economic order. Chifley's Commonwealth Bank Bill established the words later repeated in the Reserve Bank Act 1959, ironically introduced by the Menzies government. Let me quote to you the words in Chifley's legislation, in his Commonwealth Bank Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It shall be the duty of the Commonwealth Bank, within the limits of its powers, to pursue a monetary and banking policy directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia and to exercise its powers under this Act and the Banking Act 1945 in such a manner as will best contribute to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) the stability of the currency of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) the maintenance of full employment in Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>This today remains the charter of the Reserve Bank of Australia. I urge all members to go to the recent annual report and open up the front cover. On the inside they will find that those words are repeated chapter and verse. The purpose of Chifley's banking reforms in the late 1940s have been fulfilled. So we should be celebrating the fact that Chifley's goals have been satisfied without the need for nationalisation or Commonwealth ownership of the Commonwealth Bank. Chifley's goals, his central goals in the late 1940s, have been satisfied without tying up scarce public resources which could be better used elsewhere&mdash;for education, reskilling, infrastructure and social equity programs&mdash;in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seriously believe that Labor's goals have been fulfilled in the banking sector, the goals that Chifley himself established in the late 1940s. In 1995 we can celebrate not only Chifley's success but also that of Andrew Fisher who, in 1911, established the Commonwealth Bank. Let me quote from the then Labor Prime Minister and Treasurer in his second reading speech on the Commonwealth Bank Bill 1911:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will be a bank belonging to the people and directly managed by the people's own agents. It will ultimately become the bank of banks rather than being a mere money lending institution. Our chief aim is not to make profits but to ensure safety and security to depositors.</PARA>
<PARA>The first of his two goals in the second reading speech for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank has been long satisfied by the banking standards that we have in place in Australia. The bank of banks, the central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, is effectively controlling monetary policy in Australia. The second objective, to ensure the safety and security of depositors, has been satisfied. There is absolutely no question that that goal has been satisfied in the 1990s. One can logically conclude out of this that public ownership of the Commonwealth Bank cannot enhance either goal&mdash;the role of the Commonwealth Bank as a bank of banks, as a central bank, and the safety and security of depositors&mdash;because the Commonwealth Bank for many years has been operating with a commercial charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to appreciate that the so-called Labor tradition in this area was a response to the collapse of the financial sector in the depressions of the 1890s and the 1930s. Labor's response was a crude instrument of public ownership. Today, our response is much more sophisticated, adept and relevant. Labor's policy on banking, as shown in this legislation, recognises the globalisation of financial markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give some statistics, and I hope that the member for Wills is taking note. In 1975, the international bank lending volume was $265 billion. By 1994, it had increased by a factor of 16 to $4,200 billion, or $4.2 trillion. In 1980 the total stock of financial assets traded globally was $5,000 billion. By 1992 this had increased sevenfold to $35,000 billion, twice the GDP of the OECD nations. McKinseys have forecast that this market will increase to a massive $83 trillion by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big challenge for left of centre parties is how to respond to the globalisation of capital. I would argue that international cooperation is the only effective means by which national governments can respond to the internationalisation of capital&mdash;the only effective means by which governments can play a countervailing role in supervising and regulating the movement of capital and in supervising and regulating the financial sector&mdash;all in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find the response of leftist economic nationalists, like the member for Wills, totally inadequate. They are trying to defy the internationalisation of capital, and defy it in a way that is totally unrealistic and totally untenable. This bill asks: why should the Commonwealth maintain its $4.5 billion stake in the Commonwealth Bank in an attempt to influence a $83 trillion industry? The statistics are so overwhelming. Why should the Commonwealth government, with an opportunity cost in its investment, try to maintain its $4.5 billion investment in the Commonwealth Bank in an attempt to influence a $83 trillion international industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you look at the proportion of that investment to the global market, the percentage is 0.00542 per cent. That is, the Commonwealth government's half holding in the Commonwealth Bank is 0.00542 per cent of the international financial market. What sort of influence can you have on those sorts of figures? What sort of countervailing role can the government play through public ownership? It is an absurd, completely irrelevant and unrealistic proposition in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some would say that the Commonwealth Bank has a role to play with regard to symbolism&mdash;symbolism of what Labor governments used to do. In my experience, particularly in my working-class electorate, symbolism is a middle-class luxury. I would caution anyone in the Labor Party or those on the broader Left of politics to be most careful about the way in which they look at the symbolism of the money power. Things evolved in Labor history through fear of the money power. It was an ideology that wove together issues of nationalism, imperialism, monopoly, democracy, class and race into a grand conspiracy theory. It served as a populist tool in the national debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But like all populist tools, the money power thesis had its scapegoats. It was deeply and irreversibly anti-Semitic. That extended from left wing members of the Labor Party in the 1920s, like Frank Anstey in Victoria&mdash;someone the member for Wills would describe as a good bloke&mdash;to the Right in New South Wales, like the Auburn plute, Jack Lang. I urge members to read Jack Lang's writing about the money power. It is deeply and irreversibly anti-Semitic. This is hardly an enlightened or progressive tradition. It is, more likely, racist and primitive in its approach to public issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Symbolism has an opportunity cost&mdash;the opportunity cost of how the public investment could be used elsewhere. The Commonwealth's 50.4 per cent share in the Commonwealth Bank has a market value of $4.5 billion. It is a part of the 1995-96 budget strategy to recognise that the macro impact of a $4 billion fiscal tightening has the same effect as a one per cent tightening of interest rates. The denationalisation of the Commonwealth Bank thereby reduces the Commonwealth's call on financial markets. It has a positive impact downwards on interest rates in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to the issue of symbolism, I would like to apply the Claymore test. Claymore is a public housing estate in my electorate, an area that is genuinely struggling to find employment and the social and economic skills required in our post-industrial society. Quite truthfully, public ownership, by the Claymore test, counts for little. I recently distributed 30,000 survey sheets to electors in Werriwa. There was not a single mention in the responses of the denationalisation of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the mainstream issues for left-of-centre parties in the 1990s are very clear from working-class opinion: they are all about finding employment, getting a job; they are all about getting a good HSC result; they are all about the first generation in working families taking out a university degree; and they are all about acquiring economic and social skills&mdash;not ownership&mdash;for the information age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would rather spend $4.5 billion on education reform, on tackling the education disadvantage in working-class areas by linking the home learning environment to the school learning environment through new forms of information technology. I would rather spend $4.5 billion on providing extra public sector jobs in low skill, low demand regions, like the south-west of Sydney. I would rather spend large slabs of public resources on the redistribution of government facilities to areas of greatest need. I would rather spend $4.5 billion on public housing renewal, on labour market programs and on the introduction of universal case management for disadvantaged parts of our community. I would rather spend $4.5 billion on refashioning the effectiveness of the welfare state, in response to an information based society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of these reforms are expensive and intensive in their administration. Reformist government&mdash;government interested in social justice in the 1990s&mdash;cannot bear the opportunity cost of having billions of dollars of public resources locked away in areas of ownership when these genuine equity tasks are outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an old saying that if you are not a socialist at 20 years of age you have no heart. I am sure that applies to the member for Mackellar at any age. The saying goes on that if you are still a socialist at 40 years of age you have no head. The combination of those two things applies perfectly to the member for Wills. That is not to suggest that he is not genuine. The member for Wills is genuine in his goals, but he is confusing goals with methods and confusing ends with means. That is the sign of a confused thinker, someone who is not clear on the sorts of goals and relevance that we require for public sector administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's goals are still the same. The strong in our society have a responsibility to help the weak. Active government can play a positive, equalising and liberating role in our society. It is just that our methods and our means have altered. Public ownership no longer satisfies equity goals. Public ownership is not an end in itself; it is not satisfying the sorts of social justice objectives the Labor government has and should continue to have in the 1990s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I respect very much the opinion on economic matters of my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who has just resumed his seat. He is one of the people in the Labor Party who argues a consistent line. I watched him when he was Chairman of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, taking in nine councils of the western part of Sydney, and I know that he has a very authentic view about economic management. He has been consistent prior to his entry into parliament and since being here. One of the problems, however, is that the ducking and weaving of the Labor Party, to eventually come to a position that he has endorsed at the very beginning, is destructive and distracting for the whole of the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) is prepared to issue a letter in the prospectus signing off on further sales of the Commonwealth Bank has damaged the investing confidence of hundreds of thousands of small investors. I know of people who used their life savings, $5,000, to buy shares in the Commonwealth Bank, expecting that this would be their one and only chance. Having made that purchase&mdash;and they are lifetime clients of the Commonwealth Bank; there are hundreds of people in these circumstances&mdash;they find that the government is going to catch them on capital gains tax, and they cannot afford that. They are looking at this package of $5,000 as something to pass on to their families. Not only that, but the government then dilutes the whole process by moving for a further sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no objection to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, but the uncertainty, the toing and froing, the sudden gaping holes in budgets, the inability to manage and plan ahead that the government has demonstrated, are completely at odds with the consistent line that has been run by the honourable member for Werriwa. I think it is a tragedy that there is not a better sense of direction and management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has only to look at the broad accounts of the Commonwealth to realise that Australia is in desperate circumstances. We are running a massive deficit, one of the largest of any nations in the world, yet we have got massively increasing taxation, in a period in which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is claiming that taxation will be kept to a minimum and he will promote massive changes relating to the needs of middle income earners. He has not done that. Taxation has increased as a percentage of gross domestic product. At the same time, we have had to enter into the sale of what amounts to the Australian silver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the last remaining institutions to be sold by the Australian Labor Party. The next one will be Telstra, and they will sell it after the election, if they should win the election. There is no doubt about that; they have to plug the hole. The profligate spending that they have gone on with has been to no advantage for most Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will keep saying that it is not the Commonwealth that has a problem with the foreign debt; it is not the Commonwealth that has borrowed money. But they cannot explain away the fact that there is a $9 billion interest bill in every budget to pay the interest charges on the funds that we have borrowed. Every year, that is ticking over. It is as big as the education or health budgets. We are borrowing at the same time, and we are selling assets at the same time. If we were a private company run by any of the great businessmen who are friends of the Prime Minister, we would not only be called before the stock exchange but we would be disbanded as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Werriwa has argued a consistent line, so I have got no problems with many of the things he said about privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank; that is his view. But I know he would also be concerned about the fact that the debt is so large that we are hitting Australians with high tax rates and we are flogging off the silver at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know where the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the  Prime  Minister (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table, thinks Australia is going to finish, because there is always the promise of turning the corner, but we never quite get there. There is always the promise, but next year you sell a bit more, or next year you increase taxes somewhat, or next year the interest charges go up, or next year something else will be sold. It just goes on and on, getting worse. All that seems to be of concern to the parliamentary secretary and members of the Australian Labor Party&mdash;barring the member who has just resumed his seat&mdash;is to retain office. They do not care where they lead Australia as long as they appear to be in front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think President Chirac said something very significant yesterday when he said that you are followers and not leaders. All you do is stay in front of the opinion polls to retain your popularity and let the Australian community rumble you along in any direction that the whim of the day happens to take them. You do not go below the surface and find the distress there is at the size of the foreign debt and at the fact that we no longer own Australia and foreigners have us captive to their economic circumstances. You do not go below the surface. All you do is rumble along in front of an opinion poll driven attitude to government. President Chirac was exactly right in summarising the attitude of the Prime Minister this morning. He said, `They are not leaders; they are followers.' That is the problem with the leadership in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This latest effort, the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill 1995, is the final part of the process. There are a number of issues that are of concern to the opposition, but my major concern is what the government is going to do with the Commonwealth Development Bank. That bank, with a charter and history of support for primary industries, small industries and manufacturing, has been the very core of prospects for new and developing businesses and for carry-on and consolidation funds for established businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farms of Australia are littered with tractors and equipment bought through the Commonwealth Development Bank. There are factories full of machinery and equipment purchased through the Commonwealth Development Bank. There are small businesses running today that would not be there if it were not for the Commonwealth Development Bank. There are medium and large businesses which were established by loans from the Commonwealth Development Bank. But here you are again coming into this House with a framework of legislation that is devoid of detail, devoid of regulation and devoid of the very essence of your intentions and you expect the House to accept, once more, the proposition that the Commonwealth Bank be sold, regardless of the circumstances or the future of the Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Development Bank, one of the great establishments and institutions of this nation, has played its role in this nation's development from a pastoral, grazing, farming and cropping economy to a diverse manufacturing and tertiary industry. That role has been most significant.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why the Labor Party caucus would walk away from what must be one of the institutions of Australia simply for the sake of making a sale because the Treasurer and the Prime Minister need the dough to pour into the coffers. That is the principle you as a party are prepared to sell out on in relation to the Commonwealth Development Bank. You are not prepared to request them to provide the detail. You are not prepared to hold things up until there is certainty not only for both those who have borrowed and the long-term borrowers of the Development Bank but also for the future of further borrowers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the position now for small business and farmers seeking to establish a firm understanding of their financial commitments, opportunities, prospective expansion and prospective consolidation of both farms and factories if they do not know whether or not there is going to be a Commonwealth Development Bank?

They are all a standard&mdash;a hopeless standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole thing you guys have done is to be prepared to sell out Australia no matter what the conditions and circumstances are. Where are the commitments from the government in regard to these matters? You are going to sell the remaining 50.39 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. You are just going to roll that out. You are going to sell to whoever comes along. You have some caveats on foreign ownership. For goodness sake, this is not what Australians expect you to do with one of their great assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can imagine what the cries would be from the Australian Labor Party if it were a Liberal government making this sale. There would be accusations of mates in high places and of deals done with foreigners to sell this bank.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that in your party room this is a matter of contention and that those who are concerned about the Commonwealth Development Bank were narrowly rolled in a division.

<PARA>The Airports (Transitional) Bill 1995 and the Airports Bill 1995 went through this parliament just last week. The Federal Airports Corporation is privatised. So, time and again, despite the statements and the promises to the electorate, this Labor Party is prepared to go back on its promises and renege on everything it has made a commitment on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government is tired, cynical and corrupt. The sale of the Commonwealth Bank embodies all of these things perfectly. If one wanted a perfect demonstration of the bankruptcy of this government, not just in financial terms but in morality and principle, it would be hard to beat this legislation we are debating today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, there is the financial bankruptcy. The Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) have told us that the sale of the government's remaining 50.39 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank is a vital part of the 1995-96 budget. This year's budget technically delivers a surplus of $718 million&mdash;and the crucial word here, of course, is `technically'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When all the clever accounting tricks are seen through, when all the one-off items are discarded, the figures actually show a budget deficit closer to $8.5 billion&mdash;not, of course, that the government will have any of this. Again the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance rushed to assure us that, once the two tranches of the Commonwealth Bank shares have been disposed of, around $4.5 billion will have been raised. In other words, the sale of the final part of the government's share of the Commonwealth Bank is just part of a financial sleight of hand trick&mdash;and not a very convincing trick at that&mdash;designed to give the government a notional surplus at the bottom of its budget papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's bill is part of the asset sales program that the government is using to fudge its budget figures. But we should also remember that in the past the government's successes in achieving its budgeted asset sales figures have been abysmal. We should remember that the government has only received $5.8 billion, or a paltry 53 per cent, of the $11 billion worth of projected revenue from asset sales it has written into budgets since 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this year's budget the government has outlined plans to increase proceeds from asset sales from $55 million last financial year to $5.4 billion&mdash;an optimistic jump in anyone's language. It is lucky, perhaps, that they have such blue-chip offerings to sell such as Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. Quite a few members of the ALP are not all that happy with what the government has put on offer. After all, the Commonwealth Bank, the people's bank, has been a Labor icon for so long&mdash;and this is where the moral bankruptcy comes in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Liberal Party suggested disposing of the bank a decade ago, many of the people who are putting out the `for sale' sign today were scathing in their response. Ten years ago selling the Commonwealth Bank was derided as being one of the ultimate New Right heresies. Today, for just the same lot, it is simply a matter of good public policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1890s, like the 1990s, were a time of recession for Australia and, like today, it was ordinary Australians who were hardest hit. The idea of a people's bank, a bank that was more than a mere money lending institution, became an important goal to the nascent labour movement. When Andrew Fisher's Labor government, the first ALP government with a majority in both houses, legislated to establish the Commonwealth Bank, the then Prime Minister told the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this will be a bank belonging to the people, and directly managed by the people's own agents . . . our chief aim is not to make profits, but to ensure safety and security to depositors.</PARA>
<PARA>Something fairly dramatic must have happened in Labor's approach to banking over the years. In the 1980s and early 1990s, state banks run by Labor governments in Victoria and South Australia cost ordinary Australians billions of dollars. It was, of course, to pay off massive debts run up by the failure of the Victorian Labor government to properly govern its state bank that the first shares in the Commonwealth Bank were sold. Even then, Labor's attachment to state banking remained strong. Joan Kirner, the then Premier of Victoria, rejected a higher bid from Westpac to take over the State Bank of Victoria. Back then, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Kirner believed that the benefits to Victoria of having a publicly operated bank take over the business of . . . the public state bank of Victoria, was worth more than $55 millions in terms of state interest.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, a state Labor government in desperate financial straits was prepared to go without $55 million of much needed asset sales just for some ideological point. Today that ideological point is going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the sale of the bank was announced, the co-convener of the Left&mdash;the parliamentary secretary's own faction&mdash;Senator Bruce Childs, ran through all the predictable bits and pieces of Labor nostalgia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're not very happy about it.</PARA>
<PARA>But then he told the truth. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suppose I'd have to say that the Commonwealth Bank hasn't helped in recent times because there's been a great deal of criticism of the Commonwealth Bank behaving much more like a commercial bank in recent times, and there's certainly a fair bit of evidence of that.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course there is, Senator. The Commonwealth Bank is run like any other bank. This government has a keen appreciation of history. It knows the value of tradition, particularly in times of rapid change. That is why it has stressed Labor icons like the Commonwealth Bank in the past. But when it needs cash all this goes out the window. The Commonwealth Bank is being sold, and everything to do with its sale is a grand exercise in hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When British Labour leader Tony Blair spoke to the News Corporation leadership conference in Queensland last July, he at least was honest enough to admit:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will, inevitably, be overlap between left and right in the politics of the twenty-first century. The era of the grand ideologies, all encompassing, all pervasive (and) total in their solutions . . . is over.</PARA>
<PARA>This should not have come as a surprise to any of us in Australia. Nick Greiner was talking about `post ideological politics' half a decade ago. But the pragmatists of the ALP have developed a habit over the years of suddenly becoming old style class warriors when they think there might be a vote or two in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the British Conservative Party launched its big ticket privatisations of government bodies such as British Telecom and British Gas in 1985-84, Tory grandee and former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan warned against selling the family silver. Twenty thousand kilometres away, it was a cry the Australian Labor Party, then firmly convinced of the evils of privatisation, was happy to take up. Of course, since then, it has learnt that privatisations are not necessarily all bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Privatisations and the notion of privatisation are not all bad in themselves, but how and why they are carried out can certainly be. Some of the initial privatisations carried out by the British Conservatives after 1979 when employees of small state enterprises were allowed to take over businesses that should never have been in government hands have been amongst the greatest privatisation success stories worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was much to be said for the notion of a share owning democracy, where small consumers would still have a significant say in the operation of largely privatised utilities, and with the proper regulatory framework and competition policies in place this could have worked. It has only been in its later privatisations, such as the break-up of British Rail, that the British Conservatives have slightly lost their way. The only beneficiaries of these seem to have been the consultants from large accounting firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to contrast the approach of the Tory Party to privatisation and the attitudes of the ALP that have led to today's bill. The Conservatives were motivated by the absolute necessity of cutting back a state that had reached an insupportable size. They were motivated by the desire to give people a real interest in the companies they worked in and in the directions of the services they used. They may not have succeeded in all these things, but we should remember the intent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here in Australia, under this government, the story has been entirely different. There has only ever been one reason for privatisation&mdash;extra cash. The Labor Party has been happy to use Macmillan's words when criticising the idea of privatisation but, when it has put the idea into practice this is exactly what it has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, but we believe there is a good cause for disquiet over how it is being sold. There are legitimate concerns over the future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank over whether acquisition of property that arises as a consequence of the buyback of shares will be on just terms under section 51 (xxxi) of the constitution and over the retrospective effects of the regulations under this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned as to why it is being sold. If the truth be told, it is clear that Labor has never had any coherent plan for privatisation nor any real motivation. Privatisation under the ALP has been an exercise in trickery and ad hoc politics. The government has simply sold off bits and pieces here and there to fund whatever grand design it has been promoting at the time. When the first big part of privatisations like Qantas were announced, the government felt obliged to call special party conferences to reassure its members of its commitment to majority public ownership and to try to convince them that at least some respect was being paid to party rules and traditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, those of us on this side of the House do not oppose the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. The only real opposition comes from my colleague the member for Wills (Mr Cleary), who seems unable to progress from that paradigm of the first half of this century which saw the growth of the state as the provider of services. That does not mean that all the members opposite are happy with what their ministers have decided. After all, we should remember that the ALP national conference has voted to retain part of the bank in public hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People like the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) have expressed their concerns. I again quote Senator Childs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this case, I suppose we're saying that some of that debate took place, a very vigorous debate took place when the initial moves were made to privatise or partially privatise the Commonwealth Bank. We've been very vigorous in our opposition in those days. This is the culmination once you start going down that privatisation route . . . we have a Budget decision and we're obviously not terribly happy about it, but because it has been made a Budget decision, there's little we can do about this.</PARA>
<PARA>Their shame is obvious when you consider that only one has had the guts to speak to this bill. They have been steamrolled. Their party's traditions, not to mention policy making rules, count for nothing. To the Left, there is no point in fighting any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that so many members of the government feel this way. Labor has no reasons for privatisation other than revenue raising. Privatisation is to the ALP what the local pawnshop is to a mug punter. It has been a quick and relatively easy way of grabbing a bit of cash. When the last batch of the Commonwealth Bank shares was sold in 1993, the then Minister for Finance wrote to all investors reassuring them that `the government has no intention whatever of further reducing its shareholding'. Eighteen months later, as Treasurer, he is flogging the lot off to produce a phoney budget surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not privatised to help consumers. It has not privatised to make government enterprises more competitive. It has not privatised to encourage share ownership or to give consumers a greater say in the services that they use. It has privatised because it needs the funds. Despite all its protestations, that means privatisation has not been an exercise in investment or economic reform. All it means is that privatisation has been a desperate struggle for extra cash. Privatisation under Labor has been a textbook example of privatisation as selling the family's silver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, like the government's whole approach to privatisation, is an exercise in botched economic reform. It is a demonstration of the government's failure to solve, let alone adequately tackle, the central dilemmas of contemporary politics. We are at a crucial stage in the development of society in government. Capitalism&mdash;large scale industrial capitalism&mdash;is a fairly recent phenomenon. It was born in England at the end of the 18th century and has been widespread for only the last 100 years. Those years have been paralleled by another phenomenon: the emergence of rapid economic growth that has made our world so different from the famine-surplus cycles that have plagued nations in the past. Finally, there has been a third phenomenon: the growth of government. One hundred and fifty years ago, great nations like Germany did not exist. But, as the enormous economic growth of the 19th century pushed local and regional economies together, councils and governments merged to create our modern states, our nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1990s, we are witnessing a change of equal significance. Growing global technologies, computers and telecommunications are exerting upward pressures and forcing upon us an internationalisation that will have a deep impact on our traditional notions of the state. Today's bill is part of the adjustment process to this trend, but it is an inadequate response. The head of the Economist Intelligence Unit, Nico Colchester, writing in the London <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spectator</EMPHASIS> earlier this year, spoke of the great inversion of roles that is taking place across the world, claiming governments are accustomed to setting the context within which elites and markets operate; while now it is the elites and markets that set the limits within which governments govern. He quoted the World Bank's latest report on global economic prospects, which states that one effect of globalisation is to expand the options available to private individuals and firms while reducing those of the policy makers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been all too clear in Australia, people look to government to protect them from change, from competition and from cultural intrusion. But Colchester argues that international leaders are now answering to an international meritocracy. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spectator</EMPHASIS> article suggested governments can react to the power of these floating elites in three ways&mdash;by revolting, acquiescing or adapting. Revolting, according to its author, is trying to put the genie back in the bottle. A country as large and self-sufficient as America or as small and authoritarian as Singapore might have a chance. A country like Australia would be out in the cold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, Colchester recommended a mixture of acquiescence and adapting, of accepting that competition between systems of government in a global market is not necessarily a bad thing. He suggested that the reach and control of late 19th century governments was probably an historical aberration, where for a brief period of time national government harnessed forces of technology to impose itself, which has now risen above government and demoted it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Labor Party initially liberalised its platform in 1990 to allow the privatisation of Qantas, it did so because of budgetary stress. Budget demands are the excuse for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. However, the demands of globalisation, internationalisation and the new challenges facing governments are equally significant reasons for this change in policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nanny state has proved a total failure. Government everywhere has been proved to be unable to run community and society and voters everywhere have revolted against its futility, burdens and bureaucracy. But the counter theory&mdash;the teachings that were first formulated by people such as Friedrich von Hayek and culminated in the neo-conservatism of the 1980s&mdash;has also not been proven. The nanny state has not  shrunk; instead it is growing even faster. By now it has become clear that developed countries can neither extend big government nor abolish it and return to some imagined 19th century state of innocence. The government we need will have to transcend both groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Merely taking an axe to government will not work. Instead, we need to rethink government. Every agency, every policy, every program and every activity of government should be confronted with the questions: what is your mission? Is it the right mission? Is it still worth doing? If we are not already doing this, would we now go into it? We need to know what results should be expected of government. We need to know what non-governmental ways there are of doing things that governments do not and cannot do effectively. We need to ask what the proper functions of government might be and could be and what results governments should be accountable for. We need effective government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this environment flogging off the Commonwealth Bank for a quick revenue fix is appalling policy. It shuns all the real questions needed for genuine economic reform. The Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill is legislation from a failed government that has lost its way.

Who would have thought that a federal Labor government&mdash;a government for the battlers and true believers&mdash;would be today moving a bill to sell the final 50.3 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. Only yesterday the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) was lampooning the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) for suggesting that Telstra should be broken up and flogged off. He is a member of the New South Wales Right and there he was, nailing his public enterprise colours to the mast and bemoaning the coalition's alleged support for foreign ownership of Telstra. The fact that Murdoch&mdash;the bloke who reckons the Keating government is not looking after the battler&mdash;is the great beneficiary of Telstra's communications infrastructure is never acknowledged by the minister. The fact that publicly owned infrastructure will be exploited by Murdoch's Foxtel to ultimately disadvantage viewers, all in the name of competition, is consistently ignored by the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), whose cliched textbook soliloquies about competition have become compulsory listening for House of Representatives insomniacs, really wants a bit each way. On 23 October, in a speech subsequently supported by his ideological mate the member for Warringah, he shed crocodile tears about possible Murdoch-Packer control of Rugby League and Rugby Union. What he did not mention was that control of our sporting culture by the media moguls is because of, not despite, government policy. As Ken Davidson noted on 15 April 1995, Murdoch did not even have to go through the public tendering process to win supply of the black box pay TV signal decoding mechanism to Telstra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister for communications was on the speakers list for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank he would be saying exactly what his mate from Werriwa had to say. He would tell us that we had no reason to hold on to a public asset of this kind because the market is a better deliverer of outcomes when it comes to banking and that it was only established and then defended by the old plodders&mdash;King O'Malley, Ben Chifley and the like. This, however, is exactly what the member for Warringah, his leader and the rest of the coalition believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is, as the member for Werriwa will tell you any time you bother to ask, that the ALP, as with the coalition, is totally committed to privatisation, except when you are struggling to distinguish yourself from the opposition and you desperately need to score a political point, as we saw yesterday with the minister for communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought I might start with a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sale of the Century</EMPHASIS> or <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pick-a-Box</EMPHASIS> approach to this question. See how you go on this score. It is a bit of shame that the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) is not with us because I am sure he would get the answer to this question as quick as a flash. Here it is: who said, `What in the name of reason is the justification for breaking up and selling off the great and efficient national assets like the Commonwealth Bank, Telecom, TAA and Qantas?' To make it a bit easier, I will give you a hand: it definitely was not King O'Malley; it was not John Curtin; it could not have been John Hewson; and, although John Howard has discovered his working-class roots of late, it was not him. It was too easy really, wasn't it? We all know that the person responsible for this affirmation of ALP principles was none other than the former Prime Minister and member for Wills, Bob Hawke. Of course, he was not on his own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985, the year the friend of the battler made that statement, they were lined up in support. The present Prime Minister, Paul `Labor to the bootstraps' Keating, in his previous life as Treasurer, was adamant. He said, `We are as protective of the ABC's public position as we are of the Commonwealth Bank.' In 1990, after the part sale of the Commonwealth Bank, the then Treasurer waxed lyrical about the Commonwealth Bank's `unique quality as a government owned bank'. After the decision in 1993 to sell 49.9 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank, the present Treasurer, the Hon. Ralph Willis, told the faithful:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've made it quite clear in the legislation that went through the parliament that we would not go below the 50.1% mark.</PARA>
<PARA>Now the deregulation and competition freaks in the party can argue all they like about the efficacy of the government holding on to the Commonwealth Bank. They can follow the Prime Minister's line that `there's no policy reason why it should remain a publicly owned institution' all the way up the slippery pole. But that does not the alter the fact that this government has lied and continues to lie to true believers about its attitude to public assets. Given the series of broken promises by prime ministers and treasurers in relation to the Commonwealth Bank, why would anyone believe that Telstra or Australia Post are safe? Why would anyone believe that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have look at the government's record on privatisation. In 1987 it sold the defence services loan authority. In 1991 the ALP conference approved the sale of 49 per cent of Qantas and 100 per cent of Australian Airlines. In 1991 the government announced plans to sell 49 per cent of ANL. In 1992 the ALP conference approved the sale of 49 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. It merged Australian Airlines with Qantas and announced plans to sell off 100 per cent of Qantas. In 1993 British Airways bought 25 per cent of Qantas. In 1994 the ALP conference approved the sale of the airports and 100 per cent of ANL and a number of other utilities. Of course the airports were not a sale, only a 99-year lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995 the government decided to sell off the Commonwealth Bank and the rest of Qantas. As the present Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) said in this House, the ALP does have a proud record on privatisation. Public assets&mdash;those that are left&mdash;will be safe only when people in the Labor heartlands vote for progressive alternatives opposed to rampant privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anyone has ratted on the Labor Party it is the Prime Minister and the new breed of technocrats who dominate the upper echelons of the ALP. Sadly, the only way the Left will regain the ascendancy is for the party to be in opposition. The likes of the member for Reid, Laurie Ferguson, will supersede the right-wing bandwagon merchants&mdash;and they know who they are&mdash;if the party goes into opposition. In opposition, those on the Right will become liabilities as the party attempts to redefine itself along interventionist lines. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Paradoxically, it is the ALP's embracing of privatisation and free market policies that threatens its future and enables the coalition, which is hardly a party of the working class, to actually flag the question of who is looking after the battlers. The fact that a party which consistently blames trade unions for Australia's economic problems can actually get away with flagging its commitment to the so-called battlers is possible only because of the ALP's drift to the Right. As they say in the northern and western suburbs: if the ALP goes down, it will have gotten its right whack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what about the arguments for privatising the Commonwealth Bank. As John Quiggin points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By selling the Commonwealth Bank and using the proceeds to repay debt the government makes long term saving in interest payments, but it loses the profits that the bank would have earned. The problem is to compare the gains and losses.</PARA>
<PARA>The facts are, as members of this House know and John Quiggin points out, the Commonwealth Bank in 1993-94 made a profit of $682 million, half of which is the government's share. Quiggin argues that savings on debt interest in privatised enterprises in Australia, New Zealand and Britain have been less than profits forgone and that privatisation has reduced public sector net worth. I suppose the $100 million to $250 million of revenue lost by the government's sale of the Commonwealth Bank is chicken feed compared with the $5 billion windfall this sale will accrue the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is typical of this government's approach to ownership and national sovereignty, there appears no desire to keep the bank in Australian hands once it is floated. By repealing section 27L of the act, which requires that the government has majority control of the bank, foreign control is no longer out of the question. As for suggestions, in the absence of statutory regulations, that the Treasurer might act to deny foreign ownership beyond the 40 per cent aggregate threshold allowed under the 1975 Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, I can only say: I'd like to see that. The idea that this government would act on the grounds that further foreign ownership is contrary to the national interest is laughable. </PARA>

In a slap in the face to the Australian government, the French government forced the withdrawal of Electricite de France from the tendering process. As I recall, Jack thought the Kennett government's posturing on the question of French nuclear testing was humiliating. We should not forget that the Keating government is already supporting moves within the OECD for a multilateral agreement on investment to comprehensively open up national borders to foreign ownership, or movements of capital for foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this comes at a time when foreign investment in Australian companies is increasing and payments of profits and dividends to overseas investors are rising. In the last financial year, interest and earnings to overseas banks and companies accounted for $18.4 billion of the $26.9 billion current account deficit. The days of the ALP using privatisation as a weapon against the coalition, as the minister for communications did yesterday, must surely be over, finished, dead, gone. To see the minister waving the finger at the member for Warringah and declaring his commitment to Telstra is about as galling as it gets. As the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the member for Petrie (Mr Johns), said on 7 September 1993, in response to allegations by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) that the government was a reluctant privatiser:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is far more accurate to say it is a careful privatiser but it does not have an ideological position that is either for privatisation or against it.</PARA>
<PARA>It is about time the people of Victoria, in particular the Public First Organisation, had a good hard look at statements such as this. Anyone who believes that a party which has no ideological opposition to privatisation would protect state public utilities needs to think  again.  John  Brumby  and Theo Theophanous do not want the Public First Organisation to defend public utilities. They want it to attack Jeff Kennett. That, I am afraid, is only half the equation. We have all heard ad nauseam about the beauty of competition from the deregulation freaks. But when the Commonwealth Bank was jacking up its prices in the market, wasn't it instructive to see the Treasurer forced to act like the owner of the bank and shoot around for a quick meeting and a word of advice? No matter how much the minister for communications crows about competition, the facts are that telephone charges, as Ken Davidson pointed out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in April 1995, are about eight per cent above the OECD average and are set there by Austel to ensure the survival of Optus. It is an interesting dimension to the free market approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the money shufflers are out of step with the Prime Minister's view, he is the first to want to stick his bib in and interfere with the market. So it was the case with the Treasurer who, fearing an electoral backlash, had to use his government's controlling interest in the bank as a means of pressuring the Commonwealth Bank to reduce its charges. Wasn't it delightful to see the likes of the Glimmer twins attacking bank charges when, under their government's policies&mdash;policies they support to the hilt&mdash;the truth is that the ordinary punter has no protection from the banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If deregulation and the free market are all they are wrapped up to be, why do we need intervention by the Prime Minister or the Treasurer? Who will be the guardian when the Commonwealth Bank is sold and the market truly rules? In an interview with Monica Attard on 20 June 1995, Anthony Albanese, a bloke who is replacing a woman, Jeannette McHugh, as the candidate for Grayndler&mdash;maybe the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and the like ought to think about that&mdash;was puffing out his chest and advising the Left to act independently. He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I think that that's why it's necessary, when something like the Commonwealth Bank is privatised, it is necessary for the Left to come out publicly and oppose it because it is simply an inappropriate decision out of touch with Labor's rank and file. And I think that there's a need for the Left to take a very vocal opposition to decisions such as that. I think that, in general, the general free-market approach to economic policy decision-making needs to be turned around and I think that the parliamentary Left have a role in changing that.</PARA>
<PARA>Where is the parliamentary Left today? Who have they sent in? What joker have they sent in to defend the sale of the Commonwealth Bank? Yes, the whippet from Werriwa, the extreme Right of the Labor Party. I cannot see one member of the Left. I really do feel sorry for the Left, but at some point they have to nail their colours to the mast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have really got to ask the Left why they continue to be bullied by the New South Wales Right. The fact that the Commonwealth Bank has not behaved like a people's bank in recent times is no reason to sell it off. Make it work like one. As John Quiggin asks, why is the government making a final commitment to deregulation when many people are suggesting the policy has not lived up to expectations? I am sure the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) would ask the very same question. He wants to put a tax on international financial transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deregulation in the banking system now means that the bottom end of town, the unprofitable battlers, are being driven out. As Ken Davidson points out, because of its origins the Commonwealth Bank has more of these battlers than the other banks. That is the kind of tradition that the member for Werriwa ought to be thinking about. He ought to understand what that means in the ALP tradition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we find that even the member for Werriwa is suggesting that we should be regulating the banks. When the market does not give the right return, when it does not behave properly, you send the minister around to tell the banks how to behave. But you will not be able to do that after today. </PARA>

He is telling working-class people they are unemployed because they are unskilled. What absolute arrogance!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, despite the fact that the federal government cut $1.2 billion from its Working Nation jobs program in the last budget.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working-class people in Werriwa must be sick of their member's patronising, technocratic nonsense. Why can't the Commonwealth Bank set the pattern and look after those people who are being driven out of the system? The fact that people, supposedly, did not cite banks as a problem in a mickey mouse survey conducted by the member for Werriwa proves absolutely nought. Low income people are always complaining about the banks. If they were not, the member for Werriwa and his right-wing mates would not be shedding crocodile tears and flagging regulation in this House. Ken Davidson, some time ago, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government has a duty to impose a regulatory regime on the banking system which ensures that it remains genuinely open to all, given that its sale of the Commonwealth Bank has abolished competition in banking as effectively as the sale of the ABC would effectively abolish program diversity in broadcasting.</PARA>
<PARA>This debate is not about symbolism only and it is not simply about tradition, but there is symbolism in this. If members of the Labor Party think that symbolism does not mean anything, then I wait until the next time the Prime Minister talks about being Labor to the bootstraps and evokes the memory of the light on the hill to see those members over there who do not support symbolism stand, laugh and condemn the Prime Minister. But they will not condemn the Prime Minister because they think that tradition, a set of values and a set of coherent ideas are worth something and that those traditions spur people on to make policy about social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), talks about social justice all the time. The Commonwealth Bank issue is one of social justice. That is why the Left are not in here talking about it&mdash;because it is about social justice and it is about fairness, equity and a more egalitarian society. Are the banks really delivering that fairness and those egalitarian principles to Australia's society at present? Not a chance! People are being driven into credit unions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This nonsense about confusing ends with means that the member for Werriwa trots out every day is nothing but a smokescreen. Ends are ends.

I refer to Qantas, the FAC and Telstra. The minister was talking about Telstra yesterday and has been challenged as to what the government is going to do. It is about all that is left to privatise.

When John Langmore argued that the sale was a breach of previous promises to caucus and the bank's shareholders, what he was referring to was the public letter which the then Minister for Finance, Ralph Willis, issued to the shareholders of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</PARA>

I will read from the article by Tom Burton regarding that letter&mdash;that commitment which the then Minister for Finance, the present Treasurer, made to the people of Australia and the shareholders when the government was selling the other half of the Commonwealth Bank.

Just to make sure no-one missed the message he added: `The government is proud of the Commonwealth Bank's record and looks forward to the Commonwealth of Australia continuing as the bank's majority shareholding in future.'</PARA>

The aspect of this legislation which I am most concerned about is the changes to the status and role of the Commonwealth Development Bank. This bill provides for the conversion of the Commonwealth Development Bank into a company limited by shares under the Corporations Law, with the name the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sale of the Commonwealth Development Bank has many far-reaching consequences. Chief among them is the impact this sale will almost certainly have on the nation's rural and small business people&mdash;the people who are most reliant on the Development Bank. This bill represents another slap in the face from this government for those people and families who have plunged ever deeper into financial and social crisis under the 13 years of Labor government in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original charter for the Commonwealth Development Bank was spelt out in the Commonwealth Banks Act of 1959. Section 72 provides that the functions of the Development Bank are, firstly, to provide finance for the purposes of primary production and, secondly, to provide finance for the establishment or development of industrial undertakings, particularly small business undertakings. An important aspect of this financial assistance is that it is available as a last resort: that is, it is available when other finance is either difficult or impossible to get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Development Bank's focus was on development needs, on long-term success rather than short-term security. For these reasons it was appropriate for rural and other small businesses with high capital costs and low short-term profits. It has provided an invaluable source of revenue for many people in small business, for many primary producers and farmers right across this nation who have long-term financial needs and cannot provide the short-term security that is required by major commercial lending institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These specialised functions of the Development Bank were extended in 1993 by the passing of the Commonwealth Bank Amendment Act. This amendment enabled the Development Bank to provide finance where some, but not all, of the finance would be available from other sources. In other words, the 1993 amendment authorised the Development Bank to provide finance in situations where finance could not be raised on commercial terms. This amendment was made only two years ago. Given the specialised charter of the Development Bank, it is little wonder that it was extremely popular with rural producers and small business people. It satisfied a very real need in the rural finance sector by filling a gap in the market supply of capital. It played a very real role and could continue to provide a very real role in regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us today repeals that very valuable bank charter and replaces it with a newly named memorandum of the Commonwealth Development Bank. I think it is reasonable to suspect that, along with the repeal of the Development Bank's charter, a much more fundamental change is going to occur with the operation of the bank. This remains the case even though the charter is said to remain in the memorandum. The reason for this suspicion is that there is no guarantee that the government will continue its funding role of the bank. The key to the operation of the Development Bank's special charter lies in the government's financial commitment to the Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without this subsidisation, the bank could not afford to perform the role it does. But the continuation of this financial commitment is under threat, for a variety of reasons. The first reason is that the future role of the Development Bank is completely unknown and unspecified. As the explanatory memorandum to this bill states very clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill does not define the future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank.</PARA>
<PARA>That is quite clearly spelt out in the explanatory memorandum. This is confirmed in the Commonwealth Bank's 1995 annual report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The future of the Development Bank is currently the subject of review by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>The people in small business out there, the primary producers of this country, deserve an answer on that review before the next federal election. The primary producers of this country want to hear before the next federal election what the government is really thinking on this issue. In the annual report of the Commonwealth Bank for 1995 it is spelt out quite clearly that the Commonwealth Development Bank is currently the subject of review by the government. Therefore, we are all left in a state of uncertainty as to what the future role of the bank and the government will be. This is particularly unfair for those people who are highly dependent on the Commonwealth Development Bank for their present or future livelihood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many people out there in drought ravaged rural Australia, either on the land or in small businesses, who currently use the Commonwealth Development Bank's facilities for their financial needs. Their uncertainty is made worse by the fact that this bill does not specify the Commonwealth's annual financial obligation or commitment to the Commonwealth Development Bank. Under the existing legislation the Commonwealth provides the Commonwealth Development Bank with capital injections. That subsidy or financial commitment, which is critical to the operation of the Commonwealth Development Bank, is currently worth about $20 million a year. However, while the explanatory memorandum to this bill says that the Commonwealth will continue to pay an annual subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank, the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill does not define what this annual subsidy arrangement will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill repeals section 85A of the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 which provides for that Commonwealth assistance. All we are left with is the statement in the bill that these important subsidy arrangements will be defined in a shareholders agreement, to be entered into when the Commonwealth sells its majority shareholding in the bank. We have this thing called the shareholders agreement, something so important that it will define the future subsidy arrangements of the Commonwealth, yet we do not know what it is going to contain. This level of uncertainty is completely unacceptable, particularly in view of the special needs of those families&mdash;many of whom live in rural areas&mdash;who are dependent on an adequate subsidy arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question needs to be asked: why is the government so intent on rushing this bill through before it has specified the future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank? Could it be that the government has decided to give up its role in the Commonwealth Development Bank and surrender it completely to the market?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, the Labor Party have a secret agenda planned for the Commonwealth Development Bank, and they should spell it out. They should come clean and tell the people of Australia just what their policy is on the Commonwealth Development Bank. Why will they not come out and tell the people of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot be blamed for suspecting that the Labor Party people have a secret agenda when it comes to the Commonwealth Development Bank because they will not spell it out in this bill. The repeal of both sections covering the special charter in Commonwealth assistance leaves the Commonwealth Development Bank open to fundamental restructuring. By transferring the Commonwealth Development Bank's special charter to the memorandum, the charter really loses its substance because the memorandum could easily be amended under the Corporations Law to which the bank will be subject after the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the Commonwealth's financial commitment is critical to the operation of the Development Bank's special charter, the absence of this financial commitment will compel the Development Bank to terminate its specialist lending facilities and put all loans on a strictly commercial basis. This will see the end of the special role of the Commonwealth Development Bank as we know it. This is the case even though the bill in section 117 provides that `the Commonwealth guarantees the due payment by the Development Bank of any amount that is payable by the Development Bank to a person other than the Commonwealth'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual report of the Commonwealth Bank says that the board is prepared to tailor its specialist lending facilities only to the subsidy and not to the Commonwealth's guarantee. In other words, it is not enough for the bank to have a guarantee from the Commonwealth; it wants to see the money first. But if this money is not forthcoming, then under the Corporations Law it will have no choice but to operate according to commercial demands. The result will be that we lose the specialist lending facilities of the Commonwealth Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the end of the bad news. We have even more reason to believe that the government is preparing to terminate the special operation of the Development Bank. The basis of this belief is that the explanatory memorandum to the bill makes an allowance for the Commonwealth Bank to purchase the Commonwealth shares in the Development Bank `if an adequate annual Commonwealth subsidy to the Commonwealth Bank is not paid'. This statement clearly leaves the door open for the Commonwealth to terminate its subsidisation of the Development Bank. Why would the explanatory memorandum put in this clause if a Commonwealth subsidy was guaranteed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also reasonable to assume from this statement that the forthcoming shareholders agreement does not intend to bind the Commonwealth to an adequate level of subsidy to enable the directors of the bank to carry out the terms of the charter in the memorandum. The upshot of all of this is that there appears to be no effective guarantee that the Commonwealth Development Bank will continue its specialised services to rural Australia and to small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government quite clearly is prepared to give up on many rural and small businesses dependent on the bank, for the sake of meeting its budgetary requirements. Is this what the Labor Party has to do to pay its bills? Does this not demonstrate clearly the degree of economic mismanagement of this administration? Does it not also demonstrate the government's hypocrisy concerning the Commonwealth Bank? I know that there are many rank and file members in Labor Party branches who remember Bob Hawke saying that he would defend the Commonwealth Bank with every ounce of Labor blood in this country. </PARA>

It won by a mere nine votes, and the Court of Disputed Returns may mean that the new minister from Queensland will find that the government in Queensland will not be there very long.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to recall some of the things that were said back in 1993 when the government sold some of its shares in the Commonwealth Bank. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), in responding to concerns that the Development Bank may be moving away from its special charter, said quite clearly, `That will not happen.' This is the Assistant Treasurer, on the benches of power today. The Assistant Treasurer knew at that time how dependent the small business and rural sectors were on the Development Bank. He admitted it in his speech. Yet we see before us today the likelihood that this government will turn its back on those very same small business and rural people, despite the fact that it knows how valuable the specialist services of the Development Bank are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot believe that a government could do this to the people of Australia. If we know anything in this place, it is that the people in rural and regional Australia are doing it extremely tough at this time. Farm debt levels are extraordinarily high; they are at record levels. The total amount of farm debt in Australia is a massive $17 billion. The average farm debt is $145,000. That same farm is recording a business loss of $13,700 each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To get some idea of how bad it is in some parts of Australia, one only needs to look at the situation in Queensland. In my own electorate in the south-west of the state, the average cotton farmer has a debt of $876,000. The average grain producer is doing almost as badly with an average debt of $422,000; and the average beef producer has a debt of $401,000. In the last decade 10,000 family farms have vanished; this is a tragic figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of the Commonwealth Bank, and of the Commonwealth Development Bank in particular, threatens to make these problems worse. For many people the Commonwealth Development Bank is the thread that is keeping them from going completely under. Therefore it is essential that the government make known its plans for the Commonwealth Development Bank before the next federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the government to do this, and to restore certainty to those people who depend on the Commonwealth Development Bank. And I call on the government to define the contents of the shareholders agreement between the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill 1995 amends the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 to provide for the sale of the Commonwealth government's remaining 50.39 per cent shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank. The explanatory memorandum states that the Commonwealth's equity, based on recent share prices, has a market value in the order of $4.5 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major issues to come out of this year's budget was the decision by the Labor government to sell the Commonwealth Bank of Australia&mdash;the icon of the Australian Labor Party. They decided to sell it without consulting anyone in the party; there were only about six people who knew. Caucus was not consulted, and first knew of this decision almost at the time when it was announced in parliament. I understand that the ripples are still going through the Australian Labor Party as a result of this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the history of the Commonwealth Bank is traced it is apparent that there are many commitments from the Labor Party that the bank would not be sold. I want to remind people in this House that in September 1993, and this was included in the prospectus, the then Minister for Finance, Mr Ralph Willis, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has no intention whatever of further reducing the Commonwealth of Australia's shareholding . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was written into the prospectus for the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a lot of comments about the proposed sale of the Commonwealth Bank and some of those comments have included such remarks as, `John Curtin and Ben Chifley would turn in their graves if they knew that the government was selling the Commonwealth Bank.' But to trace the history back a little further, look at what happened with a state Labor government in power in Victoria. That government also said that the State Bank of Victoria, another Labor Party icon, would never be sold. However, that bank was sold also. The state government gave into the pressure put on it by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Commonwealth Bank took over the State Bank of Victoria at a bargain basement price and now the Commonwealth will sell off that part of it as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interim period, staff numbers have been reduced from more than 55,000 people down to 35,000-plus. That means that 20,000 people have lost their jobs with the Commonwealth Bank. A big percentage of those people are former State Bank of Victoria employees. Relate that back to the statement by Ralph Willis, the then Minister for Finance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has no intention whatever of further reducing the Commonwealth of Australia's shareholding . . .</PARA>
<PARA>You simply cannot believe any statement that the government makes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same year, in February 1993, the Prime Minister stated that the Keating government would retain full government ownership of Telecom. Yet the government have already moved towards corporatising Telecom. You simply cannot believe anything that they say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the caucus members in the Australian Labor Party knew nothing about the sale of the remaining 50.39 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. Not disclosing that fact typifies the way this government operates, with executive power running rampant. Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, I am sure that you would have been outraged, absolutely outraged, at that decision being made without your knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to a particular aspect of this Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill and that is the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank. In this House in September 1993 I raised this matter in a debate on the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill 1993. In my contribution on that debate I raised the issue of the Commonwealth Development Bank which is so very important in providing finance for small business and particularly for rural pursuits. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and it provides finance to small business where it would not otherwise be available on reasonable terms and conditions. In other words, it is a lender of last resort. I put it to the government that I trusted that the government would continue that role as laid out quite clearly in the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959. Clause 72 refers to the first and primary objective of the Commonwealth Development Bank as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)to provide finance for the purpose of establishing, acquiring or carrying on business (including businesses related to primary production), in particular small businesses, in cases where, in the opinion of the Development Bank, the provision of finance is desirable and the finance would not otherwise be available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions;</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important aspect of the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank for people from within my electorate, particularly in the rural sector and also in small business where they have recourse to the Commonwealth Development Bank for finance as a lender of last resort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subclause 72(b) of the Commonwealth Banks Act further outlines the functions of the Development Bank:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) in accordance with policies approved by the Treasurer, to participate in businesses of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) in cases where, in the opinion of the Development Bank, participation is desirable and other persons would not be prepared to participate on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions;</PARA>
<PARA>Again, it spells out its role as a lender of last resort to farmers and small business people. That is a very important role. I particularly forced that issue in the House, seeking a statement from the minister at the table at the time, the then Assistant Treasurer, now Special Minister of State (Mr Johns). I kept pushing the point about trusting the government to continue the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank as a lender of last resort, and I want to read to the House what the minister responded to me following my request to him and my continued pushing of that issue on 7 September 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Johns</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I agree. I give you that assurance.</PARA>
<PARA>What he was referring to was the continuing role of the Commonwealth Development Bank as a lender of last resort under the two clauses that I have mentioned, subclauses 72(a) and (b) of the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959. No ifs, no buts, no maybes&mdash;`I agree,' says Minister Johns, `I give you that assurance.' Quite obviously that minister was being trampled on by cabinet and the executive just the same as the Labor caucus were trampled on in this particular issue&mdash;no explanation, no nothing. He gave a categorical assurance in this House that the Commonwealth Development Bank would continue its role as a lender of last resort in providing finance to small businesses and primary production. That is just like the statement from the then Minister for Finance and current Treasurer (Mr Willis) in September of 1993 that the government had no intention whatever of further reducing its shareholding. You cannot believe anything that they say. There we have a categorical assurance from a minister of the Crown: `I agree. I give you that assurance that the Commonwealth Development Bank will be continuing as a lender of last resort.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have raised this issue of the Commonwealth Development Bank on a number of occasions in this House because of the important role that it does play in providing support finance to small businesses, rural industries and agricultural pursuits in my electorate and right throughout Australia in rural areas. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have heard members that have spoken before me speak on this important role and you will probably hear speakers following me speak on this role, because it is an essential element of the borrowing pattern of people in country areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the extent of that loan capacity of the Commonwealth Development Bank has been somewhere near $500 million per annum&mdash;a not insignificant amount, particularly when you consider the crises that have gone through the rural community in this past year. My own electorate was badly affected by drought, probably the second worst drought in central Victoria's history, and it received no assistance whatsoever, absolutely nothing, from the federal government. There was no financial support under any drought relief packages&mdash;none at all. It was left entirely to the Victorian state government to come up with some support for those people who were going through the second worst drought in the history of the Bendigo and central Victoria region. There was not one dollar from the Commonwealth. It was an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is talking now about taking away the lender of last resort to that rural community. The Commonwealth Development Bank has played a significant role in providing finance to people in rural areas and on those farms. Whilst the people in my electorate have had some good rains in the last week or so and it looks as though they might be having a reasonable season with cereal crops, it has been virtually 12 months of nil or virtually no income during that period. They have been through an extremely difficult time, unaided by the federal government. The Keating government turned its back on them and would not give them help in any shape or form, and they have had to battle on. They have probably extended their loan facility from the Commonwealth Development Bank to tide them over that 12 months period. Most of them will have virtually no income until December, January, February of next year, and then they have to meet their repayments of any borrowings that they may have made from whatever financial source. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the financial sources, the one that I refer to as being in this bill, is the Commonwealth Development Bank, the lender of last resort to many rural industries throughout Australia. Yet we have had categorical assurances from ministers of the Crown in this House, at the dispatch box where the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is currently sitting, `I give you that assurance that it will continue as a lender of last resort'. They have obviously broken that promise; they have told a story to the Australian community that is not true, just the same as the statement by the then Minister for Finance, Ralph Willis, in September 1993. It is just a continuation of that: `Tell them anything and then, if we get re-elected, we will just change our mind anyway.' They have been caught out on this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that within the government's own ranks&mdash;last Tuesday, to be exact&mdash;at the Labor Party caucus meeting, the matter was raised of the Commonwealth Development Bank and the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. This has been simmering for some time, I understand, and it was recommitted to debate. It has been simmering in the government's caucus meetings and it blew up last week in caucus. There was a motion put up to overturn that decision and it was defeated; I understand the margin was about six votes. So the caucus itself is pretty evenly divided about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the members of the Labor Party who voted to defeat that motion, `Come over and support us, particularly on the issue of the Commonwealth Development Bank because there have been so many promises made about the role of this.' Obviously there is a lot of feeling in the Labor Party ranks. I do not know where the minister at the table, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, stood on that issue. He would be aware of the difficult conditions that farmers and small rural businesses are going through at the moment, and the need to maintain the Commonwealth Development Bank in the role as a lender of last resort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that there has been some sort of deal brokered behind the scenes and that there has been some agreement about it. Hopefully, the Labor caucus can put some more pressure on the government to see the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank continue in a form such that it will be of assistance to small business and to rural interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This saga has been going on for an extended period. I have raised it on a number of occasions. The budget speech and the budget delivery was probably one of the most traumatic times for the Australian Labor Party in this House&mdash;except for some people, I think, they did not know until about half an hour before the budget speech was made that they were going to sell that great icon of the Labor Party, the Commonwealth Bank. What it means is that they will do anything, say anything, to achieve their ends. The Labor Party caucus recognised that last Tuesday, when the issue was again raised in the caucus meeting in an effort to overturn that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not privy to the full debate on that issue, but a number of members of caucus have spoken to me about it. They are concerned about the way that decision was made and the effect that it will have, particularly in terms of the role that the Commonwealth Development Bank plays. However, it follows a very similar pattern to what happened in Victoria. I referred earlier to the Labor government in Victoria and the shocking mess that it made of the financial affairs of the state, and its ultimate decision to sell the State Bank of Victoria&mdash;another Labor Party icon&mdash;to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was more of a gift than a sale if the huge assets of the State Bank of Victoria are taken into account. I want to refer to that, if you will just bear with me, because it was a very significant issue at the time. The Commonwealth Bank got this bank at a bargain basement price. It actually took over the State Bank of Victoria for $1.6 billion. That may sound like a lot of money, but just have a look at the assets that the bank had. It had 3 1/2 million account customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the proposition were put to any of the retailing giants that something had 3 1/2 million account customers, I am sure they would evaluate that into a very significant sum of money. The State Bank of Victoria also had a huge amount of property assets in land and buildings throughout the state. In fact, it touched every corner of the state of Victoria. When the Kirner government decided that it would hand over the State Bank of Victoria to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Bank got the benefit of that state bank with all those customers and assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we find that the Commonwealth Bank is in a position to sell the remaining assets which it got at a bargain basement price. The Commonwealth Bank is now able to on-trade what it has not disposed of in terms of asset sales and property sales and the dismissal of 20,000 employees. It is now able to on-sell it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the comments that I received in September 1993. Probably the most significant part of the whole case for the continuance of the Commonwealth Development Bank is the fact that it provides a facility for rural businesses and farmers as a lender of last resort. I requested that the government continue that role. I got a solid assurance from the Assistant Treasurer at that time, Mr Johns, who said, `I agree. I give you the assurance that the Commonwealth Development Bank will continue as a last resort lender.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be interested to hear the response from the minister handling this bill, the Treasurer, when he comes back to the table, to find out whether he is giving that assurance and whether that facility will continue as a lender of last resort.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reduced this parliament to the state where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is even privatising himself&mdash;selling himself off at $20,000 an hour. Surprisingly, he has not had any takers yet! But that is what this government is reduced to, and that is what this Prime Minister is reducing himself and that high office in this country to. It is a day of shame, duplicity and hypocrisy for the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the government came into office, it has sold off over $11,100,000,000 of government assets, trying to desperately get its fingers on some money to pay the incredible debts that it has been racking up in the decade or so that it has been in government&mdash;since 1983. Of those $11.1 billion, this Prime Minister, who has been Prime Minister only for a few years, has been responsible for $8.676 billion. In other words, over 80 per cent of the government assets that have been sold off have been sold off under this Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to have a look at the list of Commonwealth assets which have been listed for sale from 1992-93 to 1995-96. It is quite a list. It includes AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Ltd. As for ANL Ltd, what a farce that is. It appears the government are going to use taxpayers money to pay people to take it off their hands. That is absolutely extraordinary. It is a disgrace and a shame beyond belief. Ordinary Australian people shake their heads in disbelief at the sheer incompetence of the minister&mdash;the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton)&mdash;who has handled that. </PARA>

<PARA>that is the first 30 per cent they sold off&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government has decided to offer approximately 178 million of its shares for sale. This will reduce its shareholding in the Bank to not less than 50.1 per cent. The Government has no intentions whatever of further reducing its shareholding.</PARA>
<PARA>There you have it. What more unequivocal commitment could we get from a senior cabinet member, a senior government officer, than `The government has no intentions whatever of further reducing its shareholding'? That is the pledge that the Treasurer signed. If his word is worth anything at all, he should abide by that or, at the very least, apologise to the Australian people for overturning his faithful promise. He goes on to say in this letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is proud of the Commonwealth Bank's record and looks forward&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>more duplicity coming up&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to the Commonwealth of Australia continuing as the Bank's majority shareholder in future.</PARA>
<PARA>There is another lie. What else could we call it? It was a blatant misleading of the Australian people in writing and signed by the then Minister for Finance, the present Treasurer, of this country. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances, the obligations and liabilities of the Bank will continue to be guaranteed by the Commonwealth of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>This is another promise they have broken. Further on in the letter he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proceeds from the sale&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the 20 per cent that he is selling off here&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will go to the Government and be credited to Consolidated Revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the nub of it all&mdash;getting their grubby little hands on this money and not letting go of it. Here we are today, barely two years later, debating whether to sell off the other 50 per cent. The ink of the Treasurer's signature is virtually not dry and he is breaking all those promises. He did not make just those promises; he made further promises. The prospectus in which this letter was inserted states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information in the prospectus is accurate and is not misleading.</PARA>

<PARA>So there it is again in the prospectus, repeating what he had said in the letter. It was not as if he had said it once and had made some mistake in writing; he had repeated it again. The prospectus noted that the law&mdash;I suppose this is another form of l-a-w law was being changed to require the government to retain at least 50.1 per cent of the voting power in the Commonwealth Bank. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, neither the Commonwealth nor the Commonwealth Bank will be allowed to do anything to cause or contribute to the Commonwealth no longer holding or controlling the Commonwealth Bank shares carrying the right to exercise at least 50.1 per cent of the total voting rights in the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is again. The government has written it in plain, simple English, and it is signed off by the Treasurer, or Minister for Finance as he was then. He has broken this commitment, this solemn promise, to the Australian people time and time again, yet he roams free on the streets of Australia. If it had been Joe Bloggs, an ordinary citizen from any electorate in Australia, he would be behind the clanger today, as the member for Cowper said earlier. </PARA>

In response to a question he was asked, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've made it quite clear in the legislation that went through the Parliament to authorise this sale, that we would not go below the 50.1 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>So there it is. He has said it yet again a month later, and he breaks the promise again. He was asked whether&mdash;unlike the last time, when John Kerin had broken the commitment, the one I had spoken of earlier&mdash;he could give an ironclad guarantee that this was it, draw the line in the sand, make no more broken promises and there be no more misleading of the Australian people. What was his reply to that? He said, `Absolutely, yes.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Savings in this country are at an all-time low. That is an indisputable fact.

Total government revenue since the present Prime Minister came to power, which is not all that long ago, has increased by 30 per cent from $95 billion to $124 billion. These are absolutely irrefutable facts. Revenue is estimated to increase over the next three years of government by a further 21 per cent, with tax revenue increasing by 23 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time remaining to me, I express some particular concerns about the Commonwealth Development Bank. In their haste to sell off the Commonwealth Bank and break every solemn, faithful, absolute promise they made about that, the government have left the Commonwealth Development Bank hanging out on a limb with a most unclear future. That is of great concern to people, particularly in country areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent a country area myself. Many of my constituents, small business and farming people, have loans with the Commonwealth Development Bank, many of them because they cannot get these loans anywhere else. The Commonwealth Development Bank has a history of lending to small business and farmers&mdash;as a lender of last resort, if you like. They have been receiving a subsidy of $20 million a year from the Commonwealth government. Now it is going to be transferred.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that I am the last member listed to speak on the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill today. In that context, I reiterate what was pointed out by the member who spoke before me, the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb); that is, there has been a total absence of government members from the chamber in this debate. Apart from the second reading speech, we have had one backbench member, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), speak up in defence of the government's decision on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision by the government to sell its remaining 50.1 per cent share in the Commonwealth Bank surely illustrates a very low point indeed in Australian politics. This decision was made apparently in a matter of only a couple of days before the delivery of the actual budget by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis). The decision was conveyed to cabinet 90 minutes before the budget speech was read to the nation in this parliament. I concur with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Parkes, in saying that it appears that the first government members knew about it was when they heard it in here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get something very clear: it has been the coalition's policy to sell the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;and that decision was made and announced some time ago. However, there is a world of difference between our actions on this and the actions of the Keating government. Firstly, we made it public that it was our intention to privatise the Commonwealth Bank, and we went to an election on that issue. Secondly, we said that we would sell the bank, and likewise other government assets, for only one purpose: to retire debt. In other words, the privatising of publicly owned facilities was to take place only to retire public debt and was to be an investment, in that sense, in this nation's future. We were also, I repeat, totally up front about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast that with the Keating government's behaviour and actions on the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. This privatisation has taken place over a period of time. Everyone&mdash;particularly all those who work in this building&mdash;is aware that that has been a painful process for the Labor Party from day one. Public ownership of the national bank, namely, the Commonwealth Bank, has been an article of faith with the Labor Party for decades, for longer than many of its present members of this parliament have been alive&mdash;prior to their birth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Bank has been a central article of faith with the Labor Party, and there was vigorous and bitter opposition to any privatisation of it. I said a minute ago that no-one would be more aware of that than anyone who has been an occupant of this House since the process started. There was a time when, as you walked along the corridors of this Parliament House past the offices of private members, you would see displayed, in the clear glass window next to the external door to members' offices, posters condemning the government's decision to sell any share in the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;and these were the offices belonging to none other than Labor Party members. It has been that bitter and that public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has already been pointed out, but as I must point out again because it is so central to judging the government's action in this: senior government people have made absolute declarations in the recent past with respect to the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank, as late as two years ago when the prospectus of the secondary share offer of 178 million shares was issued by the government. And the statement was made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from the reduction in shareholding to not less than 50.1 per cent, no other changes to the current relationship between the Commonwealth Bank and the government will occur as a result of the completion of the offer.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, as a result of the completion of the share offer made in September 1993. It has been pointed out here over and again that the government itself put statements in writing. When this sale was announced in May, a series of questions were directed to the Treasurer on the subject of how the decision was made, what did it mean in relation to him personally that these statements could have been made over signature and here it was just being ripped up. Of course Mr Willis had to fob it off. Why? I come to the second significant difference between the government and the coalition on the matter of the sale of the bank: the government needs the money, not to retire debt, not to invest in the future of this nation&mdash;the term the Prime Minister emphasises all the time&mdash;but simply to pay its ongoing bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating government has banked on its assumption that the Australian electorate is economically illiterate, that it does not understand the significance of selling major assets to go towards balancing the budget rather than capital investment, for example, retiring debt. But nobody in Australia was fooled&mdash;nobody. Government members would know very well by now, because they would have had the same reaction from their constituents as I have had, that people are aware that this is reckless, profligate economic management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently undertook a survey of all constituents in my electorate. I letterboxed my electorate with a questionnaire. One of the things that was on that questionnaire was 12 headings of political issues. I asked my constituents, if they wished to respond to this survey, to indicate which of these 12 issues they considered the four most important. Interestingly, the second most important was size of government&mdash;a quite sophisticated response, I would think. Ranking also very highly was the subject of economic management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electorate is not stupid. The people of Australia are not economically illiterate. They do see what happens and take note of it and they consider what government does is important. As I have said, my constituents reacted very strongly at the time of the budget to the announcement that this money from the sale of the remaining 50.1 per cent of shareholding would go towards deficit reduction. This is the same as selling the family car to pay the local authority rates. Everybody knows the significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you sell a capital item in order to pay a current debt and a recurring debt, then next year you will be faced with the same problem. If you sell the family car in order to pay your local authority property rates, in 12 months time you are going to get another property rate notice. The difference is you are not going to have the motor vehicle available to sell again to pay that bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the economic fix this government has got itself into. It has to sell an item worth billions of dollars in order just to partially pay its ongoing expenses. Those expenses will be here again next year. It is reckless economic behaviour and it fools no-one. Everybody knows that the government is being profligate in its behaviour, that it is incapable of good economic management, that it has to sell off public assets just to pay its current bills and that next year that problem will not have gone away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to sell the bank was, of course, the result of an election year budget. The government made this decision in desperation. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister came to their decision in desperation so they could go into an election saying, `Aren't we good economic managers,' hoping that, given the budget was last May, the election was sufficiently far enough away for this behaviour to have been forgotten. Well, it has not been forgotten and, in its own ranks, it will not be forgiven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer to a couple of small newspaper reports in the press last week. Like many other people, I have been waiting with some interest to see the legislation for this bank sale&mdash;I have been waiting to see just how it would be handled. We were told that exposure drafts would be available during the budget session, but the first we saw of this bill was when it was introduced into the House of Representatives last week, and here we are debating it this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposed piece of law is very, very complicated and profound. The shadow minister for privatisation, the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), outlined quite a number of those difficulties when she responded on behalf of the coalition at the beginning of this debate. Here we are, as I said, only a few days after seeing the bill and we are debating it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members are stunningly conspicuous in their absence from this debate, because they do not want to speak on it. They do not want to have any words on the record that can be quoted by any of their political enemies on this subject, and I am not talking about Liberal Party and National Party political enemies. I am talking about their enemies on this issue from within&mdash;and they are many indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party pursued a quite extraordinary process last week. After having treated cabinet&mdash;much less the backbench&mdash;with contempt in letting it know how this legislation was to be handled, the Labor Party followed a very different process to the norm with its caucus. The Labor Party prides itself on having extremely democratic systems&mdash;its branches, its organisation and within parliament. Everybody gets a go&mdash;they get a chance to have their say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The normal process of handling a bill like this would have been to put it through the caucus economics committee, for those members to thoroughly consider it and make a recommendation to caucus. Caucus always holds the right to change government decisions, and it has done that. It changed a number after the last budget was announced. In that instance, caucus prevailed on the government to change a number of its decisions, but this time caucus was not going to get the chance&mdash;the reason being that the parliamentary leaders of the Labor Party knew they had trouble on their hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Newspaper reports outlined this in little detail. I congratulate the managers of the Labor Party on being able to hold this issue as close as they did. Only two newspapers reported it&mdash;one was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> and the other was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. I was surprised that the issue appeared to go right over the heads of the rest of the press gallery. I guess the reason is that we have waited too long and the issue has been able to fade from public sight&mdash;not least from the sight of the press, who are not vigilant to the significance of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, these reports told us that there was a backbench revolt and, significantly, it took the form of a motion on procedure. Motions on procedure generally do not bind members of factions. That motion on procedure&mdash;which was a motion to make cabinet follow the normal party procedure; that is, consideration by the caucus committee prior to consideration by caucus&mdash;was put to a vote and missed being carried by only six votes. The vote was 40 to 34, which shows how deep the divisions are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that the government prevailed on the grounds that if this was carried, it would cause enormous embarrassment to the government. We are told that the member for Canning (Mr Gear), the Assistant Treasurer, argued that the legislation had to be accepted because it was crucial to the budget and that the chairman of the caucus economics committee, in a classic act of betrayal, not only of his party but of his caucus committee responsibilities&mdash;namely, the member for Lilley (Mr Swan)&mdash;argued the same. But a number of backbenchers thought otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder where the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), the member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) and the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), for example, are today. They spoke vigorously against going ahead with the bill at all, much less through the caucus when the matter was before caucus last week. According to the story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, that vote of 40 to 34 was interpreted as a show of opposition by caucus members who abound by their faction support for the bill to show how they really felt. In other words, they were not going to go against their faction but they did want to demonstrate to the government how strongly they felt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), in his typical way, went out and said that there was strong support for the budget in caucus when, in fact, there was nothing. The Deputy Prime Minister gets away with that sort of misleading of the press time and again. He thinks he can go out with a smile and in a jolly way say anything he likes against the facts and that it will be swallowed. Apparently, it was swallowed by quite a few because, by and large, the press overlooked the significance of this. The Labor Party itself will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great legacy to the Labor Party in the time ahead will be not whether it had a backbench revolt, not whether it was so clever that it got this measure through its own party and through the parliament with a minimum of fuss and attention, but what it is going to do to its own supporters' attitude towards to the government come the election. We have as many indications as the government does that morale is extremely low in the organisational wing of the Labor Party at the moment. It is actions like this which will mean that they are in trouble with their own when it comes to the election day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a few words in conclusion of this second reading debate. Clearly, the opposition has been annoyed very much by the fact that the government has seen fit to change its mind in relation to the sale of the rest of the shares in the Commonwealth Bank and to proceed with such a sale. They obviously do not like us doing that and would prefer it to be something that was left to them. We had lots of gratuitous advice about how this is in conflict with Labor Party policy and ethics, et cetera. I think we are the ones who are better able to judge what is suitable to Labor Party policy. We will certainly stand up and defend the actions that we have taken in this regard in all our party councils or anywhere else. It is not in conflict with our party policy, nor has there been any suggestion from anyone within the party that it is in any way in conflict with party policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some point made by a number of speakers about the government's change of mind on this issue and the fact that this is somehow a heinous thing for it to do. There have been suggestions of total impropriety because statements have been made about no intention to sell further and then the decision was made to do so. The most important of those statements was the one I made as Minister for Finance in the prospectus, where it was stated clearly in the letter to investors that there is no intention of the government to sell down further. The important thing is that that was an absolutely true and accurate statement of government intention at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the prospectus is about. The prospectus is about saying what the conditions are at the time when the prospectus is issued. Clearly, if there had been an intention by us to do something else at that time and we were saying that there was no such intention, then that would have been a totally misleading statement. But that was not the case. It was subsequently well down the track that we made the decision to go ahead with the sale of the rest of the shares. Any suggestion that this has meant some detriment to investors is a complete and utter nonsense. There is no sign of any detriment to investors in the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The share price on budget night was $9.51 and the share price last night was $10.26. If there was some terrible imposition on the shareholders by this announcement, one would have expected that that would have shown up in a walking away from the asset. But, on the contrary, we have seen a much higher price. In fact, the price has been as high as $10.90. There has been plenty of opportunity since budget night for people who did not like the sale to sell off at a considerable profit, get out of that investment and go somewhere else where they would be happier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the overall position of the market is one of support for the Commonwealth Bank. Since the announcement, it has made good payments of dividends and it has also had a higher share price. This has been a very good buy for investors. The smaller investors who bought shares in 1993 did so at a price of $9.35 and the institutions paid $9.60. They have all shown a capital appreciation since that time. There can be no suggestion that there has been any damaging impact on the shareholders of the Commonwealth Bank in respect of either the dividends paid, which have been very good; the performance of the bank in terms of its profitability; or the share price, which reflects those factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of suggestions that somehow the Commonwealth Development Bank arrangements were less than satisfactory. The second reading amendment which is before the House reflects that. It says that the shareholders agreement should be included as a schedule to the bill. We are very concerned to ensure that the Commonwealth Development Bank is maintained as a substantial institution to provide concessional finance to small business and the rural sector. It has been very much part of our determination in shaping this sale to ensure that that was the outcome for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed sale arrangements&mdash;that is, the bill and the shareholders' agreement as a package&mdash;clearly define the future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank. The bill will enact various provisions which are fundamental to the future of the development bank as an independent financial institution providing specialist banking services. As I advised the House, the bill will provide for the conversion of the development bank from a statutory authority to a public company under the Corporations Law and will provide an ongoing Commonwealth guarantee of its liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the arrangements will ensure that the existing ownership is retained at 91.9 per cent for the Commonwealth Bank and 8.1 per cent for us; that an adequate annual subsidy is maintained; and that the charter is retained. In addition, by providing the development bank with greater independence with its own banking authority, the development bank can market itself more effectively to the benefit of its customers&mdash;that is, the small business community and the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see no need for the shareholders' agreement between the Commonwealth and the CBA to be included as a schedule to the bill because the agreement, which does not exist at this stage, will be a contractual arrangement binding the CBA and the Commonwealth to certain undertakings regarding the development bank. The CBA has already provided an undertaking that it will not walk away from the development bank or exercise its voting power to amend the development bank's memorandum or articles of association or to change the development bank's charter as long as an adequate annual subsidy is provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our intention to provide an adequate annual subsidy because we want the development bank to continue to perform the role that it has performed in the past. Given the importance of the specialist services provided by the development bank, the Commonwealth will provide an adequate annual subsidy and, therefore, under this government, the future of the development bank is quite assured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CBA board and the management are happy with the proposed sale arrangements, including those relating to the development bank. In fact, I am advised that the CBA chairman, speaking at the annual general meeting of the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney this morning, said that the bill `incorporates to the bank's satisfaction all the arrangements anticipated at the time the government announced the sale of its shares'. So there are no qualms on the part of the bank about these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the buyback of shares by the Commonwealth Bank, I refer to the second item in the second reading amendment, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government should give assurances that any acquisition of property that arises in consequence of the buy back of shares . . . will be on just terms under section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The buyback of shares by the Commonwealth Bank does not involve the acquisition of property by the Commonwealth. It involves acquisition of property by the Commonwealth Bank. As a consequence, it is not relevant for the purposes of section 51(xxxi) of the constitution. The opposition does not understand the whole nature of the buyback. We are not buying back. We are the seller. The buyer is the Commonwealth Bank. It is buying back the shares because it has excess capital and, by buying back these shares and extinguishing them, it can effectively utilise its reserves in a way which improves the capital assets of its shareholders. That is not an unconventional thing to do. Other banks are looking at doing something similar, I understand. This is a highly appropriate way for the Commonwealth Bank to operate on behalf of its shareholders and it is certainly suitable to the Commonwealth's purposes as a part of the overall sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The buyback of shares will only occur with the approval of a 75 per cent majority of the private shareholders voting at a special shareholders meeting. So clearly they have to decide overwhelmingly that they see it as being in their interests. The buyback will be structured in such a way that satisfies the requirements of the CBA management and the private shareholders. The possibility of a buyback is still being considered by the bank and the government. We have foreshadowed that as something which we both think looks good. That is something that we will refine as we come to the sale process proper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the final aspect, that the savings provision in the bill regarding the regulation making power is intended to facilitate the smooth implementation of the sale process. The smooth implementation of the sale process is in the interests of all existing and prospective Commonwealth Bank shareholders. I commend the bill again to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister. I ask the Deputy Prime Minister: after running massive deficits over the past few years, with mortgage interest charges rising by 25 per cent over the past 12 months and your own tax increases contributing a full half of a percentage point to inflation over the last year, as revealed in today's figures, isn't it the case that the main cause of higher inflation over the last year has been your own government and its high spending, high taxing and high interest rate policies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You&mdash;moralising on the subject of inflation rates! This is an inflation rate which is, on the underlying rate, one-third the rate that you presided over when you left office as Treasurer and less, on the headline rate, than one-half the rate you presided over. The difference between the situation now and the situation then is that we were in the depths of a savage recession when you left and we have had 16 consecutive quarters of growth. At the end of 16 consecutive quarters of growth, when there usually is, through the cycle, a little bit of inflationary pressure around the place, we have a set of figures that are well within our anticipation when we look at the Reserve Bank Governor's determination of what ought to be the inflation rate over the life of a business cycle, which is about two per cent to three per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a series of one-offs in this. They relate to some extent to a rise in Commonwealth indirect taxes, to a rise in franchise fees from the states, and to one-offs like the end of the rebate that the NRMA had operating in New South Wales and the ACT for some time which has reduced car insurance in New South Wales I think by 11 per cent and in Canberra by some 18 per cent. They cannot keep paying out that rebate; they have paid out something like $300 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By any comparison with the situation in Australia's past and by any comparison with the record of the honourable member who just asked that question and who presided over a truly appalling inflation rate at a time of very high levels of unemployment, the position is, as I have said, reasonable and, as I have also said, well within the expectations that the government laid down during the last budget.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of a report, which I must say was a huge beat-up, that appeared on Sunday in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS>. I am particularly disturbed that, in writing the story, they did not even seek any comment from me or my office. Yes, it is true that under the special intervention program the Commonwealth has committed $160 million this financial year. But 90 per cent of that funding goes to English as a second language programs particularly designed in recognition of the fact that non-English speaking background people face a real barrier to getting into employment.

In all of the examples quoted in the article, everyone who got assistance under that specific dimension also got a job. So, in other words, the special intervention program is successful and it does complement the case management approach which we have to the labour market programs in that it can more specifically target the sorts of measures that are needed. Over the last year alone the special intervention program has helped 28,000 people get into a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thought that we had something like bipartisan support for the special intervention program. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition in his fair go speech, or whatever it was, to ACOSS the other day said:</PARA>

<PARA>In Jobsback itself, the special intervention programs get continuing support from the opposition, on paper at least, because they provide programs in basic literacy, numeracy and presentational skills. But, when you look at the article, who was it out there inflaming the opposition to this very successful program&mdash;a program which, on paper, the opposition  supports?  None  other than  `Dr Darkness' over there, the shadow minister for employment, education and training. He was summoning up all the sullenness that he could gather in his attack on this program on Sunday. He said that it was a `big waste of money'. He said that it was creating training, not jobs. He said that it was a program open to abuse because we had now made the guidelines too flexible.</PARA>

So he is out there attacking in the newspaper the fact that this program is a waste of money, but then he wants to say to me, `Let me spend more; let me bend the rules more.' This is complete duplicity and it demonstrates the real problem that those on the other side of the House have when it comes to these programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition goes along to ACOSS and makes all of these reassuring noises about how they will not cut the programs.

In other words, if you elect the Liberal Party at the next election, these programs will be cut. The simple fact of the matter is that the opposition in relation to these matters is mean spirited and deceitful. We will be making sure the various groups that benefit from these programs continue to understand that it is only under Labor that they will get this support. I table the document.</PARA>

The Metal Trades Industry Association and the Australian Chamber of Manufactures have resolved that it should be removed&mdash;not to mention the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union.

You could not credit that someone who holds himself out to be the next Minister for Industrial Relations in this nation could be so inept and so ill informed. But there again, perhaps it is quite understandable, given their track record of ripping away award protections and attacking the conditions of all Australian workers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that he, the member for Calare and a number of others have been very concerned about the impact of the collapse of the Estate Mortgage group and the impact that subsequent developments have had on people's pension entitlements. I am pleased to be able to advise the honourable member that the government has decided to take some specific measures to address this problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background, the Estate Mortgage group failed in 1990. Global Funds Management took over the six funds of the group in October 1990 and consolidated them into one trust, the Meridian Investment Trust. This trust was listed on the stock exchange in December 1993. This listing meant that the trust falls under the so-called rate of return method for valuing managed investments in the pension income test. Honourable members would be aware that the government legislated to that effect some time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The price of the stock for most of the period since then has either fallen or been fairly static, so the impact on people's pensions has been minimal. With the September bulk update that the department does&mdash;a regular quarterly bulk update&mdash;there has been a rather sharp rise in the value of these units. That has produced a marked effect on some pension incomes. The rate of return methodology is yielded at some 30 per cent to 40 per cent, in that order of magnitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of special circumstances relating to this problem that need to be taken into consideration. As a result of the collapse of the Estate Mortgage group, the remaining units ended up being valued into the new consolidated arrangements at $1 per unit, which reflected little more than the net asset backing of those units. Litigation is under way by which the unit holders are seeking to achieve some restitution for the losses they suffered. So there is a real sense that the people holding those units are locked in as a result of the fact that litigation is still progressing and has not yet reached a conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was my view and the government's view that there was a case for special treatment to be provided to this group. What the government has decided to do is proceed by way of an ex gratia payment, which will have the consequence of effectively bringing this particular group under a regime similar to the new tiered deeming arrangements that will come into effect from July this year. In effect, we will be providing an ex gratia payment that means these people's pension entitlements will be set as if the tiered deeming arrangements, which come into effect in July, are operational.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The difference between what the unit holders are entitled to under the current legislation and what they will be entitled to under the tiered deeming arrangements will be, in effect, an ex gratia payment. We expect about 8,000 DSS and veteran pensioners to benefit from this concession. This decision was announced earlier today. I have spoken to a number of key people affected, and they are very happy with the announcement we have made. It was a vindication of the government's decision to proceed to the new extended deeming arrangements from July of next year under which arrangement this sort of problem would not have arisen in the first instance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that there is some provision for private mediation, because private mediation of disputes is allowed, but there is a little catch attached to it. The workers are forced to pay half the cost of mediation. So the unions are locked out, the private mediators come in under this agreement, and the workers have got to pay half the cost. Only after that mediation can the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission intervene. The workers have no access to the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission until after they have paid for the mediation. What a wonderful agreement! The Leader of the National Party had the hide to say that this was a federal agreement under this government. Nothing could be more disgraceful than this insidious agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say this: AMH has a mighty lot to learn about industrial relations. No Australian worker should be denied the right to representation or denied the right to outside assistance. If I could say a word or two about outside assistance management style, I am advised that AMH has used outside assistance at its Rockhampton plant and it has used it to secure a majority of votes for its disputed EFA. It has used a good deal of outside influence.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2908" SPEAKER="Baldwin The Hon P.J." NAMEID="MD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SYDNEY" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of Social Security has dealings with a very large number of Australian individuals and families. It is obviously a matter of serious concern to ensure that the system operates in such a way that the public can have confidence in its integrity. That means ensuring that people get their correct entitlements. It means ensuring that they are not paid when they are not appropriately entitled to be paid, and it also means ensuring that people who do have an entitlement receive their correct entitlement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In pursuance of that, the department, in 1994-95, conducted 2.2 million reviews, most of which were generated, in the first instance, by data matching activity. The outcome of that was that 8.7 per cent of those reviewed experienced a cancellation or reduction in payment, which saved the taxpayers some $37 million per fortnight. But 29,000 of these reviews, which is 1.3 per cent, actually resulted in an increase in payment. So it is not purely a one-way street here. We are about ensuring that people get their correct amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other measures that the department has pursued in this respect, to ensure that people get what they need and what they are entitled to. We have an access and equity strategy, which was praised recently by a Senate committee which has been looking at this issue. We have a comprehensive appeals system. In the great majority of cases, the departmental decisions are upheld. Nonetheless, 37 per cent of appeals are upheld and that is obviously a very important feature of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Positive data matching&mdash;which is opposed by the opposition, of course&mdash;has been used to find people who do not appear to be receiving their full entitlements. That has led to over 12,000 families being contacted. The result of that has been 3,400 people receiving extra amounts of additional family payment. So there are very clear beneficiaries from this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the most recent initiative of the department in this regard has been to produce a consolidated publication on family assistance, which honourable members would be familiar with. It is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">You and Your Family</EMPHASIS> booklet, which has been mailed to all families receiving family payment. This has been an extraordinarily successful initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It represents a consolidation of a number of other information products of the department, bringing them together in one easy to read form. It has been highly successful, as indicated by the research conducted after the publication was distributed. But the most tangible evidence of the success of this initiative is that, as a result of it, around 50,000 families are estimated to have applied for and been granted additional payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a measure which the opposition were cynical about and were critical of. They dismissed it as government propaganda. The concrete impact of this measure is that there are about 50,000 families who are now materially better off than they were before. It is very much consistent with the government's philosophy of trying to make sure that people are aware of and understand their entitlements and that they get what they are entitled to.</PARA>

It is associated with the development of technology to do two things with the gas: firstly, to extract the gas from those containers without spilling any; and, secondly, to use a plasma system of destruction of the gas. Both those systems are unique in the world and lead the world in this technology. They have been very successful.</PARA>

Does the minister accept that AQIS protection mechanisms have not only failed miserably in allowing the papaya fly into Australia but also that its sentinel posting has failed, only discovering the presence of the papaya fly after it had infested over 200 kilometres of coastline? In light of the incompetence of this federal government instrumentality, can the minister give assurances that adequate compensation will be provided to farmers, who are faced with ploughing in or having to destroy their entire annual income?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very important question. It is obviously quite appropriate for the honourable member to raise these issues. Even if I do not necessarily agree with some of the more tendentious elements of his remarks, nevertheless he is raising an important issue for his constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the concerns of the honourable member, I will deal first with the issues of competence. I am advised that in 1993 the fly was detected on five islands in the Torres Strait. It was eradicated on two in 1994 but not on three northern islands where eradication is impracticable because of their close proximity to infestation in Irian Jaya and Papua New Guinea. QDPI carried out suppression activities on these three islands. AQIS and QDPI did cooperate in the eradication program. Earlier this year, the fruit fly was detected again on the same two islands from which it was previously eradicated and on two others. A major eradication attempt is already under way up there, and AQIS is contributing half of the total cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few years, I am advised that quite substantial efforts have been made by AQIS in the Torres Strait Islands area and in North Queensland to come to grips with potential quarantine threats. Those measures include the introduction of survey and monitoring programs in the region, and the Topwatch program, which has raised community awareness of quarantine issues, including the fruit fly, to very high levels in the Torres Strait and northern peninsula communities. AQIS assisted inspectors on the larger islands and at Bamaga on Cape York to inspect for movements of fruit fly host product. AQIS has established an FM radio network across Cape York which broadcasts quarantine awareness messages as well as a weekly radio broadcast in the Torres Strait and a range of other public awareness initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal regional airlines servicing the region, Sunstate and Flight West, issue ticket wallets with quarantine information printed on all pages. There are 12 AQIS staff located in the Torres Strait and at Bamaga and a further five in Cairns who have responsibility under the northern Australia quarantine strategy for quarantine issues in Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait. AQIS has recently installed a detector dog team at Cairns airport to further improve quarantine surveillance of aircraft, including those that originate in the Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So a very substantial effort is being made in the quarantine area, and rightly so, to deal with a variety of quarantine problems. Many of those that I have just read out are obviously of direct relevance to the issue of the spread of fruit fly. So I would not automatically accept the view implied in the question that, in some form, incompetence was a factor in the situation that is now confronted by farmers in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You asked a series of further questions on financial assistance for treatment of fruit in the southern capital city markets and also on compensation to farmers who have to plough in their crop, and you made one or two suggestions about how all that might be done. I will refer those questions to the relevant minister and get him to give you an answer. But, as I am sure you would be aware, there is a very heightened level of concern in regard to all this in Queensland. There is strong cooperation between the Commonwealth service and its Queensland counterpart, and a very considerable effort is being put in to deal with it.</PARA>

I am pleased to advise the honourable member that the Department of Social Security can assist in this regard in some circumstances. Where a person in this situation contacts the department and it turns out that the missing person is in fact known to the department, the department will provide the supposedly missing person with contact numbers or addresses.

Again, the decision on whether the customer wants to receive a letter from the sender is left in the hands of the individual concerned. Where people are reported missing to the police and the police seek the department's assistance, we ask the customer concerned to contact the appropriate police missing persons agency. Moreover, the department is authorised to inform the police agency as to whether the person is known to the department. The police agency can then inform the concerned relative that the individual is alive without identifying their social security status. For missing young people under 18 years of age, as a result of initiatives announced last year we can go further and advise parents directly that a young person is alive and well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), in his answer to a dorothy dixer today, misrepresented my comments and my position on the special intervention program in several respects. In the first place he said that, in a letter to him on behalf of a constituent in which I drew attention to the constituent's wish for a broadening of the special intervention program guidelines, I was contradicting public comments I had made. This is not the case. I have consistently argued that excessive rigidity in program guidelines has been a problem of Working Nation and that a greater focus on outcomes combined with proper accountability was needed.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The letter was fully consistent with that position. The second misrepresentation is that the minister clearly implied that I had opposed the English as a second language and the literacy elements of the special intervention program which, as he said, comprised some 90 per cent of the expenditure. This again is not the case. When asked specifically about this component of the program, my response was not reported in the press, in the report the minister referred to. My only comments about the need for such training were positive. Thirdly, the minister is therefore wrong in his claim that the coalition is opposed to the purpose of the special intervention program. The press report he read out is misleading in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday afternoon during question time, we had a bizarre announcement by the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that somehow Australia had decided it would oppose the existence of nuclear weapons. This was presented by the Australian Prime Minister as though it were some sort of grand initiative. It was part of the Keating vision. The government suddenly had a new strategy on the issue of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this particular proposition, put forward by the Prime Minister, is a proposition that was put forward as long ago as 1970 by John Gorton when he was Prime Minister. Even Sir Robert Menzies had argued that in an ideal world we would be able to eliminate nuclear weapons. The Australian government since 1970, whatever its party political complexion, has always argued for the elimination of nuclear weapons. Every government has always argued that&mdash;the Gorton government, the McMahon government, the Whitlam government, the Fraser government and the Hawke government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we can assume, I suppose, on the basis of the Prime Minister's statement yesterday, that the Keating government did not support the elimination of nuclear weapons until the Prime Minister made the statement he made yesterday. In other words, I am really saying that the Prime Minister's statement yesterday was nothing short of a cheap political stunt designed to try to woo the youth vote and win back a few Green preferences which have been burnt off by the government's abominable handling of the forest industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just another example of what we have seen from the Prime Minister ever since he assumed that office&mdash;the strategy of rewriting, distorting and ignoring history in order to try to prop up his own position. There is an old saying coined by Henry Ford, which is often quoted&mdash;history is bunk. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister agrees that history is generally bunk. He believes that historical facts are bunk. What he thinks is useful is to write his own history, ignore all the achievements of the past in this country and try to create the impression he is doing something new and something creative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the Prime Minister saying that the constitution of Australia was written in the British Foreign Office. Nothing could be further from the truth. Every member of this parliament knows the history of our constitution and that that is untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the Prime Minister the other day saying that Australians during the First World War were not fighting for Australia; that it was not until the Second World War that Australians started fighting for Australia. What about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Emden</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the first military naval engagement by an Australian ship? That was not on behalf of Australia? What about the mining of the Pacific by the Germans during the First World War? What about the whole historic context of the First World War and the power balance that existed in the world at that time&mdash;all completely eliminated by a Prime Minister who wants to try to rewrite history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the Prime Minister saying that the British apparently chickened out in the Malayan Peninsula during the Second World War. The latest creation before this nuclear speech was the idea that somehow the Keating government came along and was the first government in Australian history to show any interest in engagement with Asia. This really has to be one of the more absurd propositions that this country has had to listen to from a Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1934, Sir John Latham, who was the leader of what is now the Liberal Party, a late Chief Justice of the High Court, argued that it was inevitable that the relations between Australia and the Near East would become closer and more intimate as the years passed. In 1939, Menzies was saying that the focus of Australian foreign policy had to be the Pacific. Your predecessors were all calling him `Pig-iron Bob' because he was selling pig-iron to Asia and you were objecting to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple point is that the Prime Minister continually rewrites history under a pretence that so much of what he does is a new initiative, is part of a creative government. It is nonsense. This speech yesterday was just the latest in a long line of similar sorts of nonsensical statements made by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is part of what is a sinister approach to politics, a kind of Orwellian approach to politics, where the party writes the history in order to promote the interests of the party. It is only the party leader's version of history which is right, which is comprehensible and which is permissible. Let us have a look at the embarrassment I believe the Prime Minister has caused himself. Senator Gareth Evans, when he did an interview this morning on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program, was clearly taken by surprise by the Prime Minister's statement yesterday. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament is one to which Australia and nearly all members of the international community have long subscribed.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister announced yesterday that Australia was going to support the elimination of nuclear weapons. The revised version of this book was published earlier this year, with the original one being published two or three years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Evans was asked about this issue by Ellen Fanning on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program this morning he responded, needless to say, in the prolix way Senator Evans always does, with a lot of talk about how he had been thinking of writing articles about this&mdash;which is his code for getting the department or Andrew Mack to write an article and then publish it in his name. And excuse me if I am being a bit harsh, but the truth sometimes has a place in public debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the elimination of nuclear weapons, Senator Evans said, `It's something that I have been believing has been on the agenda, sensibly, for some time.' In other words, it is not a new idea. It has always been around and it has been around, as Senator Evans and all of us know, for decades. The Prime Minister is trying to kid voters, as an election approaches, into believing the issue is something new. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier the work of the Gorton government. The Gorton government negotiated the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for Australia. The negotiations began in 1968, and Australia signed the treaty in 1970. Members on the other side of the House believe that treaties are sacrosanct&mdash;and, quite rightly, if you sign a treaty, you should mean what you say. Australia signed that treaty. Amongst other things, it is worth remembering that the treaty speaks of:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Desiring to further the easing of international tension and the strengthening of trust between States in order to facilitate the cessation of the manufacture of nuclear weapons . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The treaty goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the liquidation of all their existing stockpiles, and the elimination from national arsenals of nuclear weapons and the means of their delivery&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the nuclear non-proliferation treaty says. In other words, we signed that in 1970. Not every country in the world, unfortunately, has signed it but most have. So most countries in the world agree that the elimination of nuclear weapons is something that the world should set as an objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members opposite may recall that, at the Reykjavik summit between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1986, Ronald Reagan announced to Mikhail Gorbachev, `What we have to achieve is the elimination of all nuclear weapons as quickly as possible.' Gorbachev agreed and that was the beginning of what was known as the START negotiations. The START negotiations aimed to reduce nuclear stockpiles in Russia and the United States from 50,000 weapons to 7,500 by the year 2002. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has all been going on, but what has the current Prime Minister been doing during this time? We know what he has been doing. He has been flying over Asia on his way to the clock shops of France. He was not too concerned in those days about Asia. He was not concerned about nuclear non-proliferation or the elimination of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a test which can be used to determine concern, and all members should remember this. As your political careers wear on, people will look your name up using the computer search in their offices and find out what you mentioned on certain issues in years gone by&mdash;in other words, how much did you care about these issues?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So you look up `Keating, P.J.&mdash;member for Blaxland' and get the computer to go back as far as it can to see how concerned he was about the elimination of nuclear weapons. And what do you find? Nothing. There was not one reference to the elimination of nuclear weapons yet, through all the years he has been in parliament, it has been Australian government policy to campaign for the elimination of nuclear weapons. Through all of his time in parliament, Keating has not cared to concern himself with the disarmament issue and the non-proliferation issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Fraser government was negotiating the comprehensive test ban treaty back in the late 1970s and came within an ace of achieving a comprehensive test ban treaty, where was P.J. Keating? What was he doing during that period? He certainly was not reading the newspapers. He certainly was not trying to find out what the major international issues of the day were. When Australia won its position proudly on the United Nations Committee on Disarmament in 1978-79 the Labor Party was completely silent on the matter. When the Fraser government got us on to the committee on disarmament there was just a resounding silence from the Labor Party. Now Labor boasts about the work of the Committee on Disarmament and how well the government is doing on that committee. But it was us who got Australia on to the Committee on Disarmament, it was us who signed the non-proliferation treaty and it was us who put this whole issue on the agenda originally. We are not having that agenda hijacked by a parvenu like Keating who just strides in and announces that this is the government's policy when it has been Australian policy for so many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we have the issue of the current case before the International Court of Justice. This is a complex case and an attempt to try to establish in international law that nuclear weapons are illegal. The Prime Minister suddenly decided that he favours&mdash;he has woken up and decided this&mdash;the elimination of nuclear weapons. We assume that before yesterday he did not favour that; otherwise he would not have said he did. So along he comes and he says that he favours that. Then there is a case in the International Court of Justice and he says that Senator Evans will intervene in this case. I can tell from Senator Evans's reaction that it came as a surprise to him; he was not aware that this announcement was coming. I suppose he has not seen the latest opinion polls, so he is not quite sure of the Prime Minister's thinking on a lot of these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the government's position in the International Court of Justice? The government's position is to say, `Well, we don't want the court to rule that nuclear weapons are illegal. So the Solicitor-General is in the court arguing on behalf of the Australian government that the court must not rule that nuclear weapons be made illegal. You mustn't eliminate nuclear weapons, not in the International Court of Justice.' How insincere can you get? You do not want the elimination of nuclear weapons in one forum, but you announce in a speech yesterday&mdash;in the Great Hall or wherever it was&mdash;that you do want the elimination of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this whole exercise is a cheap political stunt. This is a political stunt from the Prime Minister, designed to win Green preferences and prop up the Labor Party's flagging vote amongst young people. Australians have had enough of stunts. We have had enough of these cheap stunts from the Prime Minister. They will not fall for this stunt this time. They will not fall for any more between now and polling day. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

What have the Liberals ever done about disarmament?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is so important to the honourable member for Mayo&mdash;he has told the House, not in this speech, that he is an expert in disarmament and he worked in Foreign Affairs for eight years beavering away on disarmament&mdash;wouldn't he direct the House to a serious speech on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record advocating the virtues of disarmament? There is no such speech. When he was Leader of the Opposition he produced The Things That Matter. I ask opposition members who respond to please point to where there is a reference to disarmament and nuclear disarmament. It is not there. It is just like Future Directions. We can pour through this document or something four inches thick. Given his glorious past in the Liberal Party, allegedly outlined by the honourable member for Mayo, there is not one reference to disarmament or a nuclear weapons free world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is the honourable member for Mayo saying, `But it was past Liberal Party philosophers and prime ministers who really said these things. They liked the idea.' It is not good enough to put it in policy documents such as Future Directions and The Things That Matter. He is not good enough to come into this House as an expert, as he claims, from Foreign Affairs and deliver a serious speech on foreign affairs. It is not there.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member for Mayo wants to make some cheap points, let me make this one. He was the dream leader of the dream team.

He occupies this position not by reason of merit or virtue in foreign affairs but because of a deal that there would be no bloodshed in the coalition party room.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite the House to look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record about what the honourable member for Mayo has actually said about disarmament. In his speech on 28 February 1985 he railed against nuclear disarmament. He said that the Western alliance is not doing enough against the growing concern by young people about nuclear weapons and the establishment of a nuclear disarmament party. He said that it is a political vacuum. He is not an advocate for disarmament, worried about ordinary people becoming increasingly concerned about the issues of disarmament.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the raison d'etre of the Treaty&mdash;this needs to be understood&mdash;is to attack the French&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He said that he did not want to be seen attacking the French or embarrassing the French. This is the honourable member for Mayo, who climbs on board the bipartisan group that went to Europe. He was saying in 1986 that he did not want to be seen as anti-French or attacking the French because of their nuclear testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other quotes that I would like to read from the honourable member for Mayo&mdash;this champion of disarmament. In talking about the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty Bill 1986 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this case the Australian Government and some other governments which have been forced against their wishes to sign this Treaty or will be forced to sign the protocols are making the wrong judgment.</PARA>
<PARA>He said in 1986 that they should never have signed the treaty or the protocols. Yet he is criticising this Prime Minister on the world stage in practical terms for wanting to see the elimination of nuclear weapons. I think you will find he said some other things. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have explained, the Government has done more than just introduce the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), on behalf of the Government, has called for the constructive involvement of the Soviet Union in our region.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the person predicting what will happen. Of course, it did not happen. But it is the old Liberal tune of commies under the bed or getting into bed with the commies. I am not quite sure exactly which one it is. This is the honourable member for Mayo speaking in 1988 about relations with the South Pacific nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it amazing that the honourable member for Mayo can get up and lecture this government about nuclear disarmament. He is an absolute hypocrite. I wish I could report that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was better. As I have said, he is such a champion at nuclear disarmament. This document which he released contains absolutely nothing about disarmament. Perhaps one of the opposition members will find a reference to it or will give me a page number. I would be happy to look at it. I took a microscope to it, but I still could not find anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the honourable member for Bennelong, the alternative Prime Minister, say about the South Pacific Forum? He said that it would derogate from our sovereignty and that Australia must not be seen as being too assertive on this issue of a nuclear free zone. He said that the government is overly optimistic, even though France and every country involved in the South Pacific are now agreeing to sign the protocols. He also believes that we have got benign, naive faith. We have got benign faith that we can actually start a process and finish it. We are seeing the finish of it now. Yesterday, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) started a most important campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons, which is something everyone on this side of the House fully supports. </PARA>

If we can see it in our lifetime, it will be great for us; it will be better for our kids; and it will be terrific for our grandchildren.' The honourable member for Bennelong, the alternative Prime Minister, the man who has the honourable member for Mayo as his spokesman on foreign affairs, said:</PARA>

<PARA>They do not have bipartisan support; they have got well-founded objections for reasons that are well set out. He continued:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has that prediction come true? Of course it has not. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, in general terms, Australia should play a constructive, not overly assertive, but helpful role in this part of the world.</PARA>
<PARA>Fancy a Prime Minister of Australia wanting to write to like-minded countries and get a world decision on this important issue! That is what the member for Bennelong was saying in 1988. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not believe that that arrangement has made that part of the world a more peaceful or a more secure one. We believe the Government has an overoptimistic view of the benefits of the South Pacific nuclear free zone.</PARA>
<PARA>Look at how many other groups of countries are trying to emulate that initiative&mdash;all because we are overoptimistic. Finally, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not place benign, naive faith in nuclear free zones.</PARA>
<PARA>No wonder the shadow spokesman could not in conscience join with the government and say in a bipartisan way, `We've put the past behind us; we've put behind us our past opposition to every initiative a Labor government has taken on disarmament&mdash;whether it has been appointing a disarmament ambassador as soon as it was elected to office in 1983 or being effective in all those treaties under a Labor government.' No wonder they could not do that, given their lousy past record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I apologise for reading so many quotes, but I could not believe the boldness of the honourable member for Mayo in getting up and wanting to attack what I think will be welcomed by ordinary citizens&mdash;that is, the Prime Minister's announcement that the government is going to make a special effort with like-minded friends to achieve a nuclear free world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to attend a delegation, which was an initiative of the Prime Minister, and talk to European countries&mdash;certainly not France and certainly not some of the other countries. There is a real desire amongst the governments in Europe to see the elimination of nuclear weapons. If the French testing has done anything, it has focused the minds not only of ordinary people about the sort of world in which they want to live in the future but also bureaucrats and governments as to whether it is possible to achieve a nuclear free world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone should be pleased at the prospect of the signing of the comprehensive test ban treaty, but whenever you discuss this&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that countries have said that they will sign it&mdash;you have the problem of the threshold states.

It has given encouragement to a number of states on the threshold of developing nuclear weapons. This must be avoided at all costs. The problem is not going to go away in 1996.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the 1995 nuclear non-proliferation treaty conference in New York last May, which was undoubtedly one of the most important multilateral arms control negotiations in history. Its task was to make the world's most important and widely adhered to arms limitation agreement of permanent duration. Unlike previous NPT conferences, the historic 1995 conference was charged with two simultaneous tasks: review and extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 May, when Ambassador Dhanapala, the president, brought down the curtain at the 1995 NPT conference, in noting the historical significance of the three decisions that had been taken, he cautioned that there were no losers or victors but that the conference's collective achievement was to permanently enshrine the global non-proliferation norm as well as to lay down new principles on non-proliferation and disarmament and on strengthened reviews. In so doing, the conference had heralded a new era of thinking about nuclear weapons and global security. It also marked another watershed in international politics when interests prevailed over ideology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major achievement was to agree on common language on a statement of principles and objectives. These principles and objectives deal with a program of action regarding the full realisation and effective implementation of article 4, including: firstly, the completion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty no later than 1996; secondly, the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a convention banning production of fissile material for nuclear weapons; and, thirdly, the determined pursuit by the weapon states of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons. The statement also deals with security assurances, nuclear weapon free zones, safeguards and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The opposition did join, in general terms, with what Senator Evans had to say at the outcome of that conference when he said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision reinforces the commitment of the international community to a world free of nuclear weapons, and represents the achievement of a major security and foreign policy objective for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indefinite extension of the NPT, for which Australia had worked long and hard&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I point out to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) that people on both sides of this House over a long period have done just that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">offers by far the best encouragement for the nuclear weapon states to continue the historic process of nuclear arms reductions which had finally begun;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">will make it more likely that the threshold or `twilight zone' states remaining outside the Treaty will eventually decide to look for their security in the renunciation of nuclear weapons; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">is vital for implementation of the provisions of the Treaty on peaceful nuclear cooperation since they depend heavily on the existence of a climate of certainty about the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA>The extension decision is legally binding, while the decisions on principles and strengthened reviews are politically binding. The latter two decisions will help establish new parameters of discourse on non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament issues beginning in 1997. While these are important gains, nonetheless they represent minimal rather than maximal or even optimal progress in terms of achieving a world free of nuclear weapons and of enhanced accountability by the weapon states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, though the extension decision per se does not include any riders or conditions, in both practical and political terms it is intimately and inextricably related to the politically binding decisions on principles and strengthened reviews. How faithfully states' parties, in particular the weapon states, live up to these decisions will essentially determine the future viability of both the treaty and the nuclear arms control and disarmament process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China's nuclear test on 15 May, two days after the conclusion of the 1995 conference, and the two French Mururoa tests since 6 September are not only demonstrative of Beijing's and Paris's insensitivity and hypocrisy on crucial global issues but also serve as a crude reminder that the weapon states' implementation of article 6 commitments requires close watch by the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both sides of the political fence here in Australia share the disappointment of many states that more progress towards nuclear disarmament was not possible during the long years of the Cold War, particularly during the first 25 years of this treaty's life. While this trend has been reversed in recent years, it needs to be promoted. We share that goal on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions taken in New York in May are welcomed. It is of the greatest importance that all parties to the NPT reaffirm their commitment, for all time, to prevent nuclear proliferation. We have never accepted that an indefinitely extended NPT would in some way legitimise the status of the nuclear weapon states forever. That would not only be unacceptable; it would be simply wrong. It does not reflect what article 6 of the treaty states. With the treaty extended indefinitely, the obligation on all states, but particularly the nuclear weapon states, to pursue nuclear disarmament has now become one from which there is no escape. Thus it is not only our hope but also our expectation that the principles and objectives adopted by the New York conference will consolidate progress to date, will promote accelerated progress in disarmament negotiations currently under way, and will result in additional early steps, in particular a permanent end to nuclear testing by 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all this, as a culmination over 25 years since the NPT came into force in March 1970, yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) set out in the very public atmosphere of the UN's 50th anniversary day to take all the credit for what has been achieved. In his usual way, he attempted to inject his bias and his historical reconstruction as the saviour of the world. As the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Australian</EMPHASIS> says, he set out to `free the world of nuclear weapons'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why won't the Prime Minister tell the story as it really is? Why won't he acknowledge that he and both of his foreign ministers have been playing follow the leader to the coalition on Mururoa and other issues for the last four or five months? Why won't he acknowledge that it was Senator Evans's initial wimpish reaction to President Chirac's nuclear testing decision that has undermined Australia's national standing? Why won't he acknowledge that he has been playing catch-up politics with New Zealand Prime Minister Bolger on the issue? Why did he and his foreign minister take so long to read the mood of the Australian people on the issue? Why is he now setting out very publicly in the lead-up to a general election to reaffirm his credentials domestically on the Mururoa issue and on the broader issue of nuclear disarmament?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In asserting yesterday that the world has a chance to find its way out of the chaos, a chance which he said will not last long, how can he put his hand on his heart that `we can help the world to grasp it, even show the way'? Why won't he accept and acknowledge that it was this side of the House that took the original NPT initiative. Clearly, the Prime Minister is again stretching the truth and clutching at straws as he attempts to pork-barrel his way back into the Lodge. Try as he might on this and other portfolio areas, whenever he calls the poll he will be caught out by the people who count and who will reject everything that he stands for at the ballot box. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the member for Chifley (Mr Price) made one of the most telling points in the last few moments of his contribution.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let's come back to the purpose of this debate&mdash;the Prime Minister's announcement yesterday in his speech celebrating the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. The contribution of the member for Mayo reminded me of the situation in my home when my two primary school aged children fight over who thought of an idea first. They tug at each other saying, `It was my idea, it was my idea.' We had the coalition claiming, `We thought of the idea first. How dare the Prime Minister steal our idea.' What a load of bunkum!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure, coalition governments have said over the last 40 or 50 years, `Wouldn't it be wonderful if we had a world without nuclear weapons.' But did they do anything about it? Did they put in place any comprehensive plan of action? No. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Occasionally, they engaged in a couple of steps in the United Nations but they took no comprehensive action to implement some form of strategic process to achieve a nuclear weapons free world. But still they feel that the idea was theirs because Bob Menzies, back in the 1940s, said something like, `Wouldn't it be nice if we didn't have nuclear weapons.' But they did not actually do anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bob Menzies allowed the British to test their nuclear weapons on Australian soil. That is how committed he was to nuclear disarmament. We are still suffering the consequences of that foolish decision by your great hero, Bob Menzies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was rocked when I heard Alexander Downer's contribution. He is so desperate to restore the reputation of the Rt Hon. Sir Robert Menzies that he even tried to defend the `Pig-Iron Bob' tag. He tried to defend the fact that Bob Menzies sold pig-iron to the Japanese in 1938, knowing that the pig-iron would be used to drop bombs on the Chinese. That is a defensible position, as far as Alexander Downer is concerned. I was shocked that he would have the hide to even bring that up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let's get back to the reality. The Prime Minister, in his speech yesterday&mdash;it is obvious that no-one in the coalition has read it&mdash;did not claim that this was some brand new idea, that this brilliant light shone in the night and he suddenly thought, `Let's have a nuclear weapons free world.' He did not claim that at all. It is about time we started to bring the debate back to the reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said that, with the end of the Cold War, we have a unique opportunity that we must grasp to take some strategic actions to capitalise on that situation. He was saying, `Let's try to force the pace of getting our world free of nuclear weapons.' He did not claim that it was a new idea. He did not claim that it was something original. All he said was that he was committing our government to a series of actions to try to accelerate that process through the United Nations and other international forums. He was saying, `Let's put some pressure on and see if we can achieve it.' I will read some of what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless we take action now, the nuclear competition that characterised most of the second half of this century will very likely return&mdash;and probably in a much more unstable and multipolar form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The world must extricate itself from the circular argument that we need nuclear weapons because we have nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that a world free of nuclear weapons is now attainable.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further on, he said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no magic wand we can wave to make this happen.

<PARA>That is the great contrast between the bleatings of the coalition and the performance of this government on this issue. Only Labor governments have put in place solid, concrete action to achieve a nuclear weapons free world and a world free of weapons of mass destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government and previous Labor governments have put in place the building blocks that may allow us to achieve it. The Prime Minister outlined in his speech a series of 11 steps that the government is committed to for the achievement of a nuclear weapons free world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the ultimate distortion by the member for Mayo in his claiming that we were being hypocritical in our case before the International Court of Justice. I quote directly from the Prime Minister's speech again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has now decided, however, that Australia will also argue to the court that if . . . the court is minded to make a decision in the case&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the case before the International Court of Justice seeking to declare nuclear weapons illegal&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it should decide in favour of the illegality of those weapons.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear statement of the government's intention. Yet the member for Mayo totally distorted the government's position in claiming that we were arguing for the court not to make such a ruling. That is not the case at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saying that there could be danger in the court considering the matter at all because, should the court decide that nuclear weapons were legal, that would set back the nuclear non-proliferation regime considerably. But were the court to decide that it does want to make a decision on this matter, that it believes it has jurisdiction, the Australian government would say, `Declare them illegal.' That is the correct position and that is the clear statement of the government on this matter. I commend the Prime Minister for his determination in trying to achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had the ridiculous situation of the member for Mayo making out that just because he has suffered the experience of his leader not consulting with him about decisions, the same thing happens within this government. I can assure the House that the Prime Minister's speech was prepared after full consultation between the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and all other members of the cabinet. It is the clearly stated policy position of this government. Just because the coalition makes up its policy on the run, and just because one shadow minister does not know what another shadow minister is talking about, that does not mean that is the way we do business on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure you that this is a clearly stated objective of this government, supported 100 per cent by every member of caucus. We are proud to stand up in this chamber today and say that this Labor government is committed to a series of actions to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons. It is a great disappointment that the coalition, instead of acting in a statesmanlike manner, commending the Prime Minister and supporting this stated objective, has to play party political games, petty little politics, stupid catch-up politics, in a desperate attempt to claim some credit. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pointed out that quite a deal of case law had been passed in these matters and that if the minister cared to have a look at the briefing note of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) on the matter he would see that the question had been dealt with, so this bill quite clearly would be dealing with the acquisition of property. The question is whether or not it is caught by the section. My amendment, therefore, was perfectly valid and ought to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister simply washed away with a wave of his hand the question of the Commonwealth Development Bank. He said that we were annoyed that the government was changing its mind. I said sotto voce&mdash;I will now say it loudly&mdash;that our concern is not annoyance. We are concerned at the hypocrisy of the government and the fact that you cannot take this government's word to mean anything at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again and again we have had examples of how the government has backflipped on statements it has made upon which people have relied, such as the statement of the Treasurer, who was then Minister for Finance, when he said that the government would not sell any more of the Commonwealth Bank and that that statement was made in the prospectus. When the opposition quite rightly pointed out that a shareholders meeting would be required to effect the buyback, the government subsequently said, `No, we can do it by legislation.' The government had to backflip on that statement and called a shareholders meeting. I also drew attention to the fact that in the simplification bill that passed through this House effecting the Corporations Law there is provision to get an exemption, upon conditions from the Australian Securities Commission, from holding the shareholders meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real concern was in the government failing to meet the concerns that were raised by so many opposition speakers about the future of the Commonwealth Development Bank. For the minister to simply say that it will continue is not worth any more than a breath upon the air. It has no substance. There is no reason why the government should be believed. The very framework, the very manner in which the legislation is drafted, means that the future of the Commonwealth Bank has been set up so that its demise can be brought about. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government have been great at mounting pieties about privatisation over the years. I said in my speech earlier today that, over the last 10 years, the government have been adept, every now and then, at dragging out the red flag and trying to rally the workers around them against privatisation. But, when they need some extra cash to try to fund their greedy and disgraceful budgets that they have introduced in the last 10 years, the first thing they sell is the family silver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have only to go back to the 1989 South Australian election to remember one such perfect example. When former leader John Olsen tried to introduce policies for the privatisation of some of the state services&mdash;services that have now been privatised under the successful Dean Brown government&mdash;Labor shouted from the rooftops. It brought ads onto commercial television and the ABC showing workers having their shirts ripped off their backs, starting at the cuffs, then the sleeves and then the back&mdash;the whole shirt coming off. It was absolutely going to town that privatisation would destroy South Australia, destroy the very social fabric which had been built in that great state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just one example of where Labor has completely gone off the rails on privatisation. Yet here it is, six years later, selling off the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Some of the members of the Labor Party must be turning in their graves. Some of the current members of the Labor Party&mdash;like Daryl Melham and Laurie Ferguson&mdash;have allowed this to happen. I am in favour of the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. There is no question about that. But my argument is that the disgraceful humbug and hypocrisy that the Labor Party has practised in the last 10 years should be recorded today as we pass this bill for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are we selling the Commonwealth Bank? Why is this government forced to do so? It is because of a lousy budget surplus of $718 million that is technically in place but is in no way a reality. The government has managed to con its caucus into the idea that achieving such a budget surplus of technically $718 million is more important than all the Labor tradition for which it has stood for since Andrew Fisher passed the bills through both houses of parliament in his first ALP government to have majorities in both houses. It is a completely elusive budget surplus. We know that when we strip away the asset sales and other sales that have been included in this budget there is a budget deficit of several billions of dollars on top of all the other budget deficits that this government has introduced in the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point to make is that the government has been manifestly unsuccessful at achieving its asset sales. It has included in its budgets in the last 10 years, or since 1987-88 to be precise, $11 billion worth of asset sales, of which it has managed to reap $5.6 billion. Now it is claiming that, yet again, it has produced a surplus, but it has been on dodgy and bodgie asset sales of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inadequacy of the Labor Party is absolutely before us today, as we pass the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill. The Left of the Labor Party have been trampled by the rest of the Labor Party for so long that they could not even mount a defence to the Commonwealth Bank sale. If they cannot do that, what is the point of having them? They have been so manifestly unsuccessful. Their hypocrisy in voting in favour of the bill today is manifest for all to see. I am disgusted with the hypocrisy of the Left of the Labor Party&mdash;not that I support holding on to the bank; I do not. They say that they stand up for workers and for ALP traditions and that they are the party for the battlers. How stark can it be today that they are so far from that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter of particular concern to me which was referred to in the second reading amendment which was unsuccessfully moved by the opposition earlier today&mdash;that is, clause 19(3) of the bill, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsection 48(2) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</EMPHASIS> does not apply to regulations that are made under this section and take effect at or after the transfer time.</PARA>
<PARA>The matter of the making of regulations has, of course, been a vexed one for this parliament and many other parliaments around the world for a very long time. There has been occasion to debate the government approach to the making of regulations and the proclamation of them on more than one occasion since I have been a member of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We not only have a government which is seeking here to make regulations to which we do not have access in a very, very important bill, but also a government seeking to give retrospective effect. We have a government which is also waiving the Acts Interpretation Act on this occasion. This is pretty extraordinary behaviour. In other words, we do not know what we are agreeing to in this debate. We do not have regulations before us. We do not have an announcement of what the regulations will be. We are going to agree to something having a retrospective effect which could have a very, very serious impact on a substantial number of citizens and in relation to a vital financial institution. At the same time, we just set aside a section of the Acts Interpretation Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many debates in this chamber we have pointed to how important the Acts Interpretation Act is to us in our deliberations and in our proceedings. I feel that this needs some serious address by the government. I note that we have present, and responsible for the carriage of this bill in the chamber at the moment, the member for Prospect and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio). I have a high personal regard for the member for Prospect. I think she is a very likeable, intelligent person. In fact, I do not think she should be a parliamentary secretary; I think she should be a minister. Given some of the drones that the government has on its front bench at the moment, she would certainly be much better, not to mention an adornment. However, I have not seen anything yet to indicate that this parliamentary secretary is really the full bottle on this bill and can give me the sort of assurances that I am entitled to ask for in this chamber on behalf of my constituents; in fact, on behalf of anyone in the Australian community who is concerned about the matter of the sale of the remaining 50.1 per cent of the public ownership of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have hoped that we could have had a government that was a little better prepared in its approach to this subject. As I said in the second reading debate earlier today, this is a matter that was announced in May by the government as part of its budget. Undertakings were given about making available, well before this, the bill and what was the government's proposal for proceeding. We saw this bill for the first time only last week. Everybody in Australia who is interested in it has had to look at it and consider it by the time it was debated today so that issues could properly be raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a mark of the hasty nature of the hatching of this decision to sell the remaining public ownership of the Commonwealth Bank that we have had to wait so long for the bill. This was not a decision that was well considered, well thought out; it was a decision that was taken within hours of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) actually giving his budget speech in the House. We are seeing some of the consequences of that in the chamber today. We have a bill on which the government, even now, has made so little progress that it cannot tell the people of Australia and those who have a very keen interest in this very real issue just what it is that it is going to be doing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make it quite clear that the opposition has always been in favour of the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. It remains in favour of the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. But, to take up the point so ably made by my colleague the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), the decision to sell the Commonwealth Bank, as I pointed out in my speech during the second reading debate, was taken in such haste, in order to fill the void in the government's budget, that no attention was paid to detail, to planning, to the consequences of what would happen to, specifically, the Commonwealth Development Bank and, indeed, the ramifications of the selective buy-back of $1 billion worth of shares by the bank from the Commonwealth&mdash;not from ordinary shareholders but just from the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have concentrated very much on the shortfall and the jeopardy in which the Commonwealth Development Bank is now placed. We have done this in fairness to those people who rely upon that Development Bank for a source of funds that allows them to stay in business&mdash;small business, rural exporters, exporters of services, people who otherwise would be unable to get capital to allow them to carry on that business and produce not only for their own benefit but for the benefit of the country as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum to the bill is honest and says that the future of the bank is not known. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) told us that of course it is known. But, of course, he is the same man who made a categorical statement to Laurie Oakes in a television interview that the government would never sell any more of its Commonwealth Bank holding after the sale of the second tranche. He put in the prospectus that ordinary mums and dads who took their savings and bought into the Commonwealth Bank could expect the government guarantee to continue and could expect the Commonwealth to remain a shareholder. It is the same man who said all those things who glibly stood up before the division on the second reading and said we could be assured that the Commonwealth Development Bank would remain, whilst the very legislation for which he was responsible and which he brought into the parliament provides for its demise. The timing of that demise is completely and utterly unknown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise the point that it could have been sensible to look at the AIDC, which is now being bought back into public ownership by the government&mdash;the government having run it down and having confused the market&mdash;but there was no consideration given anywhere that one can see to the possibility of bringing the Commonwealth Development Bank and the AIDC under one umbrella. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several points that I want to make about the other matter which is quite important&mdash;that is, to ensure just terms for the acquisition of property. I pointed out a few moments ago that when the minister said that the constitutional provision only applied if the Commonwealth was doing the acquiring, that is quite wrong. I will read that provision of the constitution:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">51. </EMPHASIS>The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have the power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(xxxi)The acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has powers to make laws:</PARA>
<PARA>Very clearly, that means if the parliament passes a law with respect to the acquisition of property&mdash;and the buy-back of shares from the government by the bank will be a transfer of $1 billion in cash&mdash;that question of acquisition of property is well and truly at issue. Section 51(xxxi) is intended to protect citizens from being deprived of their property and to ensure that under no circumstances will a law of the Commonwealth provide for the acquisition except on just terms. That is precisely what it means. It has been accepted as a constitutional guarantee of just terms for the acquisition of property and has been given a broad application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of principles have emerged on the interpretation of this section. I pointed out to the minister that if he conferred with his colleague the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) he could look at recent case law dealing with this matter, particularly five cases handed down by the High Court in 1994&mdash;the Mutual Pools case, the Peverill case, the Georgiadis case, the Lawler case and the Nintendo case. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that Legal Practice Briefing No. 13 of 28 July 1994 of the Attorney-General's Legal Practice examined the developments in the interpretation of paragraph 51(xxxi) in those cases against the pronouncements of the High Court in earlier cases. The relevant parts of that briefing regarding acquisition of property and just terms are particularly significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concluding remarks of the legal practice briefing requires particular attention to appreciate the complexities of the measure in clause 63 of the Airports Bill 1995. I think it is relevant to point out that in the Airports Bill, with which we dealt last week, clause 63 provides that the Federal Court must not make an order under part 3, which deals with restrictions on ownership and control of airport operator companies if the order would result in the acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms, and the order would be invalid because of paragraph 51(xxxi) of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, provision was made in 1990 in the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Act, which permitted the first issue of shares to the public to pay for the acquisition of the State Bank of Victoria by the Commonwealth Bank. Section 76 of that act provided that the Commonwealth Bank should pay compensation on `just terms' if the restructuring resulted in acquisition of property of any person. `Acquisition of property' and `just terms' were to have the meanings as in the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying is that it is only fair that the provision for just terms should have been included because it is possible there could be a situation where there is acquiescence or a steamrolling by the government to roll dispersed individual shareholders into agreement to terms which might fall just short of just terms. I think it is important that we acknowledge the possibility is there and provide for it. The practice note that I preferred to says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although these cases&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the five case that I referred to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have not expanded the overall scope of section 51(xxxi) to any great extent, they have made its application somewhat complex. Any legislative proposal which would affect property (which essentially means any valuable legal rights) runs some risk of being held to effect an `acquisition of property' and a question will arise as to whether that acquisition would fall within section 51(xxxi). Except for the clearest of cases (such as taxes and penalties), this is a question on which the advice of the Office of General Counsel will need to be sought.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder whether the minister sought the advice of the Office of General Counsel. Any buyback of shares will involve the acquisition of cash by the Commonwealth from the Commonwealth Bank in return for the acquisition of some of its own shares by the Commonwealth Bank under the terms of the Corporations Law as amended by the First Corporate Law Simplification Act 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The depletion of funds of the Commonwealth Bank combined with the newly privatised entity being responsible for the Commonwealth Development Bank and its charter without any guaranteed subsidy will affect the rights of other shareholders. In terms of the concluding paragraph of the legal practice briefing mentioned above, there will be an acquisition of property requiring just terms under section 51(xxxi) of the constitution. So in the interests of individual shareholders, despite the fact that there may well be an increase in equity value per share resulting from the buyback, the bill should specifically provide for just terms as is provided for under the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again and again in looking at this legislation one becomes aware of the lack of preparation and proper consultation by the government with regard to legislation. It has a record of making statements and of reversing those statements&mdash;in other words, misleading the Australian people. Thus, the minister's attempts in his summation at the end of the second reading debate to assuage any fears that I may have raised in the second reading debate really must be discounted for the simple reasons that, first, he clearly has not done his homework with regard to answering the points that I have raised and, second, his track record is that he will say one thing and simply do another. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A few minutes ago I was referring to the Acts Interpretation Act provisions in the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill and the regulations, and I was expressing my dismay at the potentially retrospective regulations we know nothing about. I was also making the point that this is of a piece with the whole handling of this bill. The chamber will recall that shortly after the budget announcement the government intended to break its previous undertaking that the remaining 50.1 per cent ownership of the Commonwealth Bank would not be sold and embark on a quite different path out of desperation because of its budgetary financial situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer (Mr Willis) was asked a series of questions in here relating to statements he had made in a prospectus, identical statements that had appeared over his signature in another document and, last but not least, the matter about whether the existing shareholders of the Commonwealth Bank had some say in whether the remaining shares were to be sold. It was very clear that the Treasurer was very ill-prepared in answering all of those questions on those occasions. It was very clear to me, I think to this chamber, to the press gallery and, through them, to the world at large that this has been a hasty, ill-considered decision and that there was a number of dimensions the government had not properly addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), in addressing, during the debate on this bill, concern about, for example, the Development Bank, I think illustrated another dimension to this. I think the role and the special place of the Development Bank are something that certainly the Treasurer, much less the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), had not thought out in advance when they made their joint decision to the exclusion of cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for retrospective regulations underlines the hasty nature of this bill. Just because we have a bill before us that has been prepared in a very hasty manner is not reason in itself for opposing regulation, but I sound a word of caution about this chamber being prepared to, first, accept doing away with a section of an act which is meant for public protection and is there for a good reason and, secondly, consider giving approval to the very notion of retrospectivity of regulations which are so fundamental, as these regulations are. I put on record my concern and I believe the concern of quite a number of members of this place at the government's chosen course. I would not want the government to say that this was agreed to without question by the House of Representatives. I am raising the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to raise another dimension. The government can use its numbers here and can treat us and the parliament with contempt and, in so doing, as I have pointed out before, treat the people of Australia with contempt, but I think the Senate will take a slightly different view. The Senate has a historical attitude on the subject of government responsibility in revealing regulations or the intent of regulations. It will not be as easy as the government may consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been more than one celebrated occasion when government ministers, their advisers or the Public Service have forgotten that the Senate does get a bit particular about making sure the rights of citizens of this democracy are properly considered when it comes to legislative detail. I think this is a case where the Senate ought to pay a bit of attention. I am not for one second indicating that anyone is going to hold up the bill. The government is not going to get that easy a way out of its dilemma, but I think it can expect that it will not get so easy a ride just ignoring it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise the point once again that I have a good personal regard for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), who is at the table, but I look forward with some interest to her response to the points that have been raised in this debate.

I might not have liked his response, but at least he did come in and respond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point we ought to have in the chamber a minister or a parliamentary secretary who can properly respond on this very important bill. If that response is not forthcoming, it is of a piece with the government's behaviour on other occasions where significant legislation has come in here. On occasions, there has been no response even to the second reading. Junior parliamentary secretaries who are not qualified to respond sit at the table, so no response is given. It is not clever. It is not a case of the members of the opposition being put in their place by being treated with this utter disregard. I do not care what a member of the Labor Party does. I have been fighting the Labor Party for 35 years. There is nothing they can do to hurt my feelings. I am quite immune to the Labor Party and to the behaviour of any of its members. </PARA>

It is through us in this chamber, whether we are government or opposition members, that voice is given to people who would otherwise be voiceless.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the remarks made by the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) and the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) in this consideration in detail stage of the Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the haste and the lack of preparation and consideration of this legislation by the government have led to many of the problems we are discussing here today. The government's haste in moving to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank at the eleventh hour&mdash;it might have even been closer to the midnight hour&mdash;when they decided that they would in fact sell the remaining balance of shares in the Commonwealth Bank, has led to this situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I posed the question to the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) about what role the Commonwealth Development Bank would play in the future, he looked nonplussed and had no answer to my query. That query went to him in June 1995, not long after the budget processes had been introduced into the House. I am quite sure he did not have a clue what was going to happen with the Commonwealth Development Bank. He probably knew that it had a separate banking licence and was a totally owned subsidiary within the Commonwealth Bank framework. The fact that it had its own separate banking licence has led to this bill being before the House and has raised the issue of what to do with that Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mackellar has made an excellent suggestion and has raised the question of whether the government did in fact consider combining the Commonwealth Development Bank with the AIDC. That question has not been answered; nor has the Treasurer (Mr Willis) responded to the query I raised in the second reading debate regarding the assurance I had from the member for Petrie, Mr Johns, the Assistant Treasurer at the time. Mr Johns had said to me in the House, `I give you that assurance.' That assurance pertained to the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank being a lender of last resort. I expressed the wish:</PARA>

I recall that during the 1990 election campaign the debate on the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank was probably at its most vigorous. Even the manager of the Commonwealth Bank and many other members of the staff were instructed to go out and give brochures about this terrible thing the Liberal Party would do if they got into government: privatise the Commonwealth Bank. The member for Bendigo at the time, Mr Brumby, was very vigorous in that campaign. The attitude was that we were the terrible ogres. Now we know who the terrible ogres are, with the government moving to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. But there are a number of unresolved questions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the fact that the Treasurer came to the table at the end of the second reading debate and made some explanations about what the future role of the bank might be. But they were less than fully explained. He did not go into the detail of what role the Commonwealth Development Bank would play in all of this. Bear in mind that the Treasurer was the Minister for Finance in September 1993 when he made the statement in the prospectus&mdash;which was made known far and wide&mdash;and I think in the House that `the government has no intention of further reducing its shareholding in the bank'. The difficulty for all of us is to believe what the Treasurer now might be telling us about the future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank. I would like to get an assurance on the record&mdash;just as I sought an assurance from the then Assistant Treasurer in September 1993 in the House. He gave me an assurance that the Commonwealth Development Bank would continue its role as a lender of last resort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears now, under the framing of this legislation, that the Commonwealth Development Bank's role is still obscure. We do not quite know exactly what role it will play&mdash;whether it will be a lender of last resort, or whether it will have any government support or subsidy. It presently enjoys a measure of support of some $20 million and provides concessional finance to a whole range of rural businesses and rural activities, including farming. The future role of the Commonwealth Development Bank has not been defined to my satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take up the point that the honourable member for Moncrieff made that it is simply not to satisfy us, as members of the opposition, but the many thousands of borrowers from the Commonwealth Development Bank and the many thousands of potential borrowers from the Commonwealth Development Bank. I am referring to people who have relied on this organisation to obtain finance when all other efforts have failed, people who have sought finance from a whole range of financial institutions but who were not able to be accommodated because of the difficulties that they were experiencing. I think what the member for Moncrieff has stated is absolutely correct. We are here to represent the people in our electorate and in the Australian community who may wish to take up financial accommodation in the future with the Commonwealth Development Bank. They want to know exactly what the terms of those financial arrangements could be&mdash;whether the arrangements will still be at a concessional rate, whether the government is backing the Commonwealth Development Bank in its activities as a lender of last resort and where the future of that part of the bank will end up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there are a couple of procedural matters that we need to highlight at the consideration in detail stage. First, as I pointed out earlier in the day, because of the standing orders in this place, when a bill comes in on a first reading, as this one did, we do not have the advantage of seeing the second reading speech and seeing the intent of the government. I would hope that the standing orders might be changed. I understand that the reason the standing orders were brought in in this way was that it was hoped that all information would be placed in the explanatory memorandum. But of course there is no obligation to do that. So it was not until we heard the second reading speech of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) that we were informed that we could see the shareholders agreement only when it was completed. That is totally and utterly unsatisfactory in the course of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important that we know whether or not any of these matters are to be addressed.

The Commonwealth Bank, in its own annual report for 1995, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the honouring of the charter, which we will be charged to administer, the Bank's objective remains to achieve a proper commercial balance between the consequences of the charter and the size of any subsidy received in support of it.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the bank makes it quite clear that honouring the charter depends upon the subsidy. There is no guarantee of an adequate subsidy; thus the charter cannot be guaranteed to be observed. Should an adequate subsidy not be paid, there is further provision in the legislation to wind up the Commonwealth Development Bank on commercial decisions. That is the nub of it. Australians who depend on the Commonwealth Development Bank as the lending authority which will lend to them when no-one else will&mdash;thus determining whether or not they will survive&mdash;are now put in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having a parliamentary secretary with no knowledge or experience in this portfolio here to answer the questions that need to be answered is an insult to the parliament. The member for Moncrieff is quite right when she says that there should be a sound protest about that. The concerns that so many on this side of the House have raised about that issue deserve to be answered, not simply for the people who are going to be looking for finance in the future but for those who depend on it at this very moment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>Earlier this year I introduced the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill 1995. That bill provided for the implementation of initiatives announced in the 1995 budget that responded not only to the particular needs that families with children have at certain times but also to making the system simpler and more consistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government recognises, however, that it is essential for the Australian social security system to be responsive to the needs of all groups in the Australian community. To that end, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill 1995 serves to give legislative effect to a wide range of 1995 budget initiatives. One group of 1995 budget initiatives will mean a better deal for people caring for others in the community, as well as for those receiving care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One group of 1995 budget initiatives will mean a better deal for people caring for others in the community, as well as for those receiving care. First, the bill will ensure that a person who cares for another person may qualify for a carer pension even if the caree is not in receipt of a social security or veterans' affairs pension or a social security benefit. A person whose family income and assets are less than $61,020 and $559,250 respectively will be able to have someone on carer pension look after them. These limits will rise in line with the family payment income and assets tests. Carers will, of course, have to meet all other existing qualification criteria for carer pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, from July 1996 it will no longer be a qualification requirement for carer pension that the carer live in the same or an adjacent house to the person receiving care. As long as they provide the necessary level of care, it will not matter where the carer lives. Thirdly, from March 1996, carers will also continue to get carer pension for a further 14 weeks following the admission of a care recipient to a nursing home, unlike current arrangements where qualification ceases as soon as the person being cared for permanently enters a nursing home. This period of payment will give carers time to adjust and look for work or meet the requirements of other income support payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also ensures that the same beneficial arrangements for people in nursing homes will be available for people being cared for in the community. From March 1996, if a person receiving care moves into the home of their carer, the care recipient's former home will be disregarded under the assets test for two years. Similarly, a carer's former home will not count as an asset for two years if they move into the home of the person for whom they are caring. In addition, from March 1996, rent assistance will be immediately available to a social security recipient who must leave their home to be cared for by somebody in the community, or to care for someone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further group of initiatives contained in this bill relates to rent assistance. Rent assistance is a supplement for people who are in the private rental market. First, from March 1996 the maximum rates of rent assistance will increase by $5 per fortnight for families with children. Secondly, rent thresholds will increase by $5 per fortnight to coincide with the March 1996 CPI increase. This will allow better targeting of assistance to rent assistance recipients who pay relatively higher rents. There are currently a number of rent assistance recipients who are `saved' at beneficial rates of rent assistance equal to the amount they received prior to rent assistance reforms in 1989 and 1993. This results in their receiving a higher rate of income support than similar recipients assessed under the current provisions. The bill provides that from March 1996 any CPI increases in the total social security entitlements of these `saved' recipients will reduce their `saved' rate of rent assistance until the `saved' rate equates with the normal current rate of rent assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for the payment from January 1997 of a new residential care allowance. This new indexed allowance will replace rent assistance for residents of nursing homes and hostels. Residential care allowance will be paid at the same rate and be subject to the same threshold, indexation and all other arrangements as currently apply to rent assistance. Social security pensioners with little or no other income apart from their pension are often unable to access lump sum amounts to help meet living or capital expenses such as emergency replacement of household equipment and car repairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will help recipients of some social security pensions and benefits by allowing a lump sum advance of a person's payment. The maximum advance available will be the lesser of $500 or 6 per cent of one year's pension payments and will be repayable by deductions from ongoing fortnightly pension payments over 13 fortnights. Advances will be made only to persons with the ability to manage financially on a reduced payment for the duration of the repayment period. A person will be able to increase the amount of deductions for early repayment or apply to have deductions reduced in times of hardship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the measures contained in the Social Security Legislation (Family Measures) Amendment Bill 1995 and the special rent assistance measure for families described earlier, sole parents receiving guardian allowance will be paid an extra $4 per fortnight from September 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families will also benefit from other measures announced in the 1995 budget. These measures provide for the simplification of the application and assessment process for family payment and child-care assistance, including combining the child-care assistance and family payment annual review processes and better aligning the definitions for child-care assistance and family payment. Ongoing entitlement to child-care assistance and family payment will be able to be reassessed at the same time. There will be increased emphasis on child-care assistance compliance, through the introduction of family compliance reviews, including data-matching and risk based interviews. The bill will authorise data-matching activity from 1 January 1996 in relation to the information provided to the Department of Social Security for determining whether child-care assistance should be paid to a person, to ensure that the information is accurate and consistent with information provided by the person to other Commonwealth agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The data-matching program is conducted under the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990. The data-matching act was originally given two years of operation, with a sunset clause to take effect in January 1993. Although the government later attempted on two occasions to have the sunset clause repealed, the parliament decided to extend its operation for a finite term. Unless amended, the data-matching act will operate until January 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After four years of operation, the government considers that the data-matching program has achieved, and will continue to achieve, substantial savings in public expenditure. It is an important control on personal financial assistance schemes, helping to keep them free of abuse and fraud. Accordingly, one of the amendments proposed by this bill to the data-matching act provides for the repeal of the sunset clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment in this bill relates to departure certificates. Specifically, a departure certificate is required for all social security pensioners who leave Australia and, currently, pensioners who remain absent from Australia for more than six months without a departure certificate have their pensions cancelled automatically. Pension may only be regranted when the pensioner returns to Australia. The harshness of the departure certificate provisions has created concern and some complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New arrangements to be implemented by this bill will mean that pensioners who leave Australia without obtaining a departure certificate will have their pensions suspended, rather than cancelled, after they have been absent for a period of six months. Pension will not be cancelled until the pensioner has been absent from Australia for 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A review form will be sent to their last known address and pension will be restored, with full arrears, if the review form is returned within three months of its issue and the person still qualifies for pension. In cases where the review form is returned more than three months after its issue but before the anniversary of the pensioner's date of departure from Australia, pension will be restored from the date of return of the form only, with no arrears being payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Secretary to the Department of Social Security will have the discretion to restore pension, with full arrears, up to two years from the pensioner's date of departure from Australia, in circumstances when being able to comply with procedures was beyond the pensioner's control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a view to providing for more certainty in decision making and alleviating concerns about recovery for a small number of debtors whose circumstances warrant leniency, this bill proposes amendments to the waiver provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 to:</PARA>
<PARA>.clarify that part of a debt may be waived in appropriate circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA>.provide for general recovery of debts over $50 where recovery can be effected by withholdings from social security payments;</PARA>
<PARA>.provide for decisions on recovery of debts to be put on the same basis as commercial decisions about present values;</PARA>
<PARA>.provide for negotiated settlements in the administrative appeals process in addition to through civil action;</PARA>
<PARA>.provide for non-recovery of debts where there are special circumstances&mdash;within certain limitations&mdash;that would make recovery inequitable; and</PARA>
<PARA>.provide for waiver where a person has a notional entitlement to parenting allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>The bill also makes a number of non-budget portfolio amendments to social security and associated legislation. A payment received by a trainee in part-time training in a labour force program currently is not taken into account as income for the purposes of the Social Security Act, if the trainee is also receiving a social security or service pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments in this bill expand this exemption from the definition of income to include a payment made to a trainee in part-time training or work experience under a labour market program where the trainee is receiving a social security benefit or youth training allowance and the payment is made to cover expenses associated with participation in the training or work experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends the waiting period provisions relevant to jobsearch allowance, newstart allowance and sickness allowance to allow any part of a particular waiting period already served by a person to be transferable across payment types. The bill also makes a number of further amendments to sickness allowance. The qualification conditions for sickness allowance for certain 15-year-olds will be modified in two ways. First, clients who are independent of their parents' or other adult financial support will qualify for sickness allowance without having to meet the work history or 13-week CES registration elements of qualification. Secondly, clients who live at home with a parent who is receiving a social security pension or benefit, a service pension or certain education payments will be able to access sickness allowance if they can establish a work history or job offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qualification for sickness allowance is generally limited to two years. The two-year preclusion period does not apply if incapacity for work is caused by a different or more serious medical condition or by relapse of a chronic condition or by the fact that the person is undergoing a program of counselling, treatment or therapy for drug or alcohol abuse. The bill amends the Social Security Act so that, in addition to the above exception, the two-year preclusion period does not apply if a person's incapacity for work is caused by a medical condition and the person is awaiting surgery that is expected to improve the person's condition within two years from the date on which the person was regranted sickness allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also removes the requirement for a medical practitioner to indicate whether a social security recipient's condition is likely to improve if that person receives treatment or undertakes a rehabilitation program as it is considered that the requirement is not essential to determining qualification for, or payability of, sickness allowance. Further, in relation to sickness allowance, amendments are made to allow the liquid assets test waiting period to be waived in hardship cases. This will align sickness allowance with waiver provisions that already exist in relation to jobsearch allowance, newstart allowance and youth training allowance. </PARA>

As well, the bill includes two categories of amendments relating to bereavement allowance. The bill amends the bereavement provisions for carer pension to provide that bereavement payments will be paid to a person who ordinarily receives carer pension when the person whom they care for dies during respite care. The provisions that deal with special short-term bereavement payments for family payment, child disability allowance and double orphan pension are amended to ensure that the four-week bereavement period commences on the day after the child's death. </PARA>

A person may be paid a social security payment up to 28 days from the day the person becomes entitled to the payment. The person then has three months from the date the payment ceases to be payable to nominate an account. If the person nominates an account within three months, then arrears are payable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill contains several important measures announced in the 1995 budget for the social security and veterans affairs portfolios. The reforms will bring increased security and stability to customers while continuing the government's commitment to target assistance to those in our community who are most in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A common thread throughout these initiatives is the simplification of existing policy and the elimination of excessively bureaucratic procedures. It is true that the scope and complexity of the Australian social security system, placing as it does considerable demands on administrators, have sometimes created procedures and rules that confuse and frustrate people. The government has made it a priority in recent times to examine ways in which the system may be simplified and made more user friendly. That work continues, with this bill marking a further step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One major initiative in this bill arises directly from the recommendations on the pension income and assets tests contained in the independently commissioned report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Targeting for equity</EMPHASIS>. The report was based on extensive consultations with pensioners, retirement community groups and industry groups who supported simple and more predictable means testing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, there are many different and complex rules for assessing the income generated by financial investments. In some cases, the rules depend on when the investment was made. From 1 July 1996, all of these rules, including the rules for assessing unrealised capital growth on managed investments and shares, will be replaced with one set of rules for working out income from financial investments. These rules will apply to all social security and veterans affairs pensions and allowances, with the exception of family payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments build on the successful bank deeming measure. They respond to the concerns of pensioners themselves about the complexity of investment rules, the frequent changes caused to pension payments and the effect on incentives to earn more from investments. The new rules are simpler, fairer and more predictable and will encourage people to maximise their resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extended deeming rules will apply to bank, building society and credit union accounts; cash, term deposits, friendly society bonds and other managed investments; and shares, loans and debentures. They will also apply to gifts of assets of more than the allowable limit. The rules will not apply to the principal home or its contents; cars, boats or caravans; antiques or stamp or coin collections; standard life insurance policies; or holiday homes, farms or other real estate. They also will not apply to income stream products, such as superannuation pensions, allocated pensions, immediate annuities or allocated annuities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under extended deeming, the total value of a person's financial investments will be used to work out income from these investments. A deeming rate of five per cent will apply to the first $30,000 of the total for single people, to the first $50,000 combined for pensioner couples, and to the first $25,000 for each member of a non-pensioner couple. A deeming rate of seven per cent will apply to the value of investments over these thresholds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The five per cent and seven per cent deeming rates have been set so that they are easily achievable in safe investments. The deeming rates will be reviewed periodically to take into account movements in financial markets. Importantly, people who earn more than the deeming rates will not have the extra counted as income and it will not reduce their payments. This significant change will encourage people to maximise their income. The current rule assessing capital growth on certain managed investments when they are cashed in will be abolished from the date of royal assent to this bill. This concession will allow people who wish to change their investments before July 1996 to do so without their payments being adversely affected by past capital growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People will have plenty of time&mdash;until July 1996&mdash;to consider their situation and adjust their investments if they wish. They will be encouraged to use the free and significantly expanded Social Security Financial Information Service for information on whether they will be affected and on the issues they could consider in making any investment changes. They could also get information from the National Information Centre on Retirement Investments, which has had its funding further increased in the 1995 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simplifying and customer oriented changes to the pension loans scheme will give social security and veterans affairs pensioners more say in when and how they receive their pensions. The pension loans scheme is a scheme under which the assets of a pensioner whose pension would otherwise be reduced because of the assets test are disregarded so that they no longer have any effect on the pension. The difference between what the pension is under the scheme and what it should be under the assets test is the `loan'. In return, the pensioner incurs a debt of the difference in the pension plus a specified rate of interest, but the debt is not recoverable until after the pensioner's death. The loan is secured by the disregarded assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pension loans scheme will be made more attractive to age pensioners and their partners by relaxing or abolishing some of the current loan conditions. The fortnightly rate of the loan will be lifted to the maximum pension rate or a rate specified by the pensioner&mdash;whichever is the lower. Therefore, pensioners will be able to take maximum advantage of their assets under the scheme. However, to participate in the scheme, the pensioner would have to be entitled to some payment under either the income or the assets test. Participants in the scheme will become entitled to withdraw from the arrangement at any time. If they do so, either the loan could be repaid immediately or the debt could be left to be recovered after death, although it continues to accrue interest until it has been repaid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To participate in the scheme, there is a current arbitrary rule that at least $100,000 must be left in a person's estate after the debt is repaid. This rule will be replaced with a new, more flexible one. Under the new rule, the pensioner may nominate a `guaranteed amount' to be left in the estate after the loan is repaid. The asset types to be used as security by the Commonwealth will now be limited to real estate. Also, the interest rate used in the pension loans scheme will now be expressed in compound interest terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognition of the difficulties faced by many older unemployed people in the labour market, mature age allowance was introduced in 1994, with a sunset clause of June 1996. There are over 37,000 mature age allowance recipients. The mature age allowance regime has proven so effective in providing appropriate support for older disadvantaged workers that the government has decided to remove the sunset clause. At the same time, other simplifying changes are being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current requirement that recipients have 12 months CES registration will be replaced with a requirement that they have no recent work force experience. People transferring to mature age allowance from unemployment payments will now have to have nine months, rather than 12 months, history of income support. People who lose entitlement to other payments such as carer pension and parenting allowance will not have to establish any particular period of income support history to transfer to mature age allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although recipients will not be required to look for work, they may do so if they wish. If they do so, they may register with the CES and receive labour market program assistance.

However, existing recipients will continue to be paid under pension conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major change brought into effect by this bill is the streamlining of payments for unemployed people into a single system which will tailor administrative requirements according to people's individual needs and circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current distinction between jobsearch and newstart allowances is primarily based on CES registration for 12 months. This distinction once represented a move from one level of income support to a more active promotion of labour market and training opportunities. However, over the years, the distinction has become more blurred, with additional labour market help such as training programs and case management support now being based on the likelihood of becoming long-term unemployed, rather than being in receipt of newstart allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From September 1996, the current two-tiered system will be replaced by a single payment called newstart allowance which will be available to people regardless of their period of unemployment. The simplified system will be coupled with an earlier review process in an intensive effort to prevent people from joining the ranks of the long-term unemployed. There will be an intensive review of all those who have remained unemployed for nine months. Some of those will also be selected for an additional review. The existing three-month review of all recipients will remain. This review will identify people at risk of becoming long-term unemployed, so that they can be referred to appropriate services and assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, people whose job search efforts are already being closely monitored or who face particular hurdles such as age, will benefit from more flexible reporting requirements. Some people whose search for work is closely supervised via one-on-one case management will be given the option of submitting forms every four weeks. This option will also be available to people undertaking formal training, voluntary work or short courses. Anyone over 50 who is unemployed and is transferring to jobsearch or newstart allowance after at least 12 months on a pension, such as carer pension, will have the option of reporting every 12 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People to be offered the reduced reporting option will be carefully selected using a screening tool that will take into account factors such as age, length of time on income support, past record of compliance with reporting and other requirements and local labour market conditions. The measures will not relax the job search efforts required of unemployed people in return for their income support, but they will streamline those requirements. People in rural and remote areas will also have the option of making individual arrangements with their regional office about how and when they lodge their forms. For example, this may include lodging forms when visiting services are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From March 1996, people receiving jobsearch, newstart or youth training allowance who become temporarily incapacitated for work will no longer have to transfer to sickness allowance. Instead, they will remain on their usual allowance but will be exempt from job search activity while they are ill. People who become unemployed because of illness and those who suffer a potential loss of income due to illness will be paid the appropriate unemployment payment instead of sickness allowance. Sickness allowance will be paid only to those who will return to their jobs or study when they recover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure makes much more sense administratively, and it will allow people who are ill to undertake part-time work if they are capable of it and to retain access to employment and education entry payments. They will also maintain continuity of unemployment history so that they are not disadvantaged later in relation to access to labour market programs, case management and job compact eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allowance earnings credit scheme will be modified from March 1996 to eliminate some anomalies and to focus it more effectively on customers with casual or part-time earnings. An allowance recipient's earnings credit will accrue at a rate equal to the amount of the unused free area in any fortnight. The maximum amount of the earnings credit that can be used in any fortnight will be limited to $100. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, the bill also contains two protocols that amend the international social security agreement between Australia and New Zealand. The first protocol provides for amendments mainly of a technical nature, while the second protocol enables people being paid under the agreement to leave their country of residence for short periods of time without losing entitlement to their pensions. It also provides for reimbursement by the country of origin to continue during these absences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When negotiating the protocols, it was Australia's objective to extend the temporary absence period for all pension types to 26 weeks&mdash;that is, not just for age pensions. New Zealand would not agree to this. We believe that 26 weeks is a fair period of time to allow for the continuation of pension payments for people moving temporarily between Australia and New Zealand. It is our intention to continue urging New Zealand to reconsider its position on this issue. Nevertheless the protocols will improve the operation of the agreement for both countries. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

The purpose of the amendment is to put on record our very severe criticism of the government in relation to the timing of the bill itself and some observations that we have to make about the government's extended deeming proposals. While the paper that has been circulated has one minor amendment to take into account some changes that occurred today, it is an area in which the government's responses have been quite ad hoc. They are obviously moving towards an election in which they need to rethink their positions almost daily. Both of these bills are the subject of changes which have occurred only in the last week or so. I foreshadow that I will move an amendment in the following terms:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons I am particularly concerned about the way in which this bill has been handled is the complexity that becomes apparent day by day in relation to social security law. It is bad law when you cannot understand what is intended by the government in relation to law that affects ordinary people, and social security legislation affects ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first bill, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, contains some 229 pages. The second bill contains some 167 pages. The law is complex. It adds to legislation that is already exceedingly complex. The government does not help itself by providing inadequate time for consideration of bills of this sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that, because of the complexity of the law, enormous difficulties will be occasioned daily. Each day you see comments from independent observers&mdash;and I am not talking about myself. The Ombudsman drew attention to these matters in the last week or two. The Auditor-General did the same last week. The Welfare Rights Movement has put on record over a long period its concern about the complexity of the social security system. This legislation does little to alleviate that concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make one point very clearly. I want to thank the staff of the Department of Social Security for their assistance to me in trying to understand this legislation. Under the program the government set, we had only eight days in which to consider the provisions. That meant that officers of the Department of Social Security had to meet with me at 7 o'clock last Friday morning. I regard that as service beyond the call of duty. I thank them publicly for that. The criticisms I offer are in no way intended to reflect upon the professionalism of the officers involved. But it does reflect very seriously upon the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To introduce bills with more than 40 amendments&mdash;particularly when they contain provisions relating to extended deeming&mdash;so late in the session is not appropriate to efficient and effective governing. Time is required to constructively study and comment on changes and to consult with interested parties. My inquiries suggest that only the Welfare Rights Movement had advance notice of the provisions and were in a position to offer some comments. Even they were preparing their comments only last Friday and that left little time for those of us in the parliament to be made aware of their concerns. That is of very significant concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the delay arose from the decision of the government caucus to change the provisions in the draft Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill, and that meant they had to reprint the bill to remove a measure that had been announced in the budget&mdash;the ineligibility of women under the age of 40 for the wife's pension.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only reason the government changed its mind is the pressure we put on it in relation to that outrageous measure. When it was understood that the government had made a clear promise to people who were affected by this measure that they would not be denied their wife's pension retrospectively&mdash;in other words, their eligibility was to be saved while entry for new claimants was denied&mdash;it wanted to walk away from the matter again. That is an indication of the government's sensitivity to this matter and of the proximity of an election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People should have regard to the fact that many other decisions were taken in the term of this government which had quite an adverse effect on pensioners and beneficiaries and which were not changed. It is the timing of this matter that makes it relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to the extended deeming issue, which is the main issue in this bill. The extension of the deeming regime and the repeal of Labor's unrealised capital gains measure&mdash;which treats any gain on shares and managed investments as income&mdash;has been a matter of some controversy. It burnt the government when it first legislated for it. I suspect that deeming will burn the government in the same way if it happened to be re-elected at the next election and these measures start to apply. I suspect that most people do not understand at this stage the impact of this measure. Certainly, the government has not seen fit to inform them of its impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position needs to be understood clearly. The coalition has long pledged to repeal the unfair unrealised capital gains provisions. We have criticised the government for the unfair nature of provisions under which people's pensions go up and down on a fairly ad hoc basis according to changes in the share market. That has created enormous uncertainty and hardship for many. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government did not receive the revenue they expected from this measure. They expected to make far more significant savings. They did not and I suspect that is one reason we are now moving to these extended deeming arrangements. The new system of calculating income on financial investments at a deemed rate of five per cent up to the first $30,000 for single people and up to $50,000 for couples, and seven per cent thereafter, will always assure the government of savings. That is outlined in the government's own statement on the financial impact of this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It expects to save of the order of $70 million in both the social security and veterans affairs areas by removing people from entitlements; that is, pensioners will lose their eligibility for fringe benefits or will lose eligibility for pensions or part pensions as a result of this measure. That is the reason there will be savings. Yet the government argues that this is a fairer measure. I suspect that those pensioners who lose out will not see it as being particularly fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I want to address, beyond the handling question&mdash;it comes through in my second reading amendment&mdash;is valuation of investments. This issue is particularly germane. I was astonished when I was told by officials that the government was proposing to rely largely upon existing administrative arrangements for reporting shifts in people's financial investments when dealing with the contentious issue of valuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has argued that the new deeming rules are attractive because they will create certainty. But people's deeming rates will move up and down, depending on the valuation of their assets. People will have difficulty understanding why deeming rates, which are fixed, are going to change. This act, when it is amended, will not tell us how often valuation is to occur. I suspect that the government does not intend to leave the matter open to pensioners to decide to elect when they might like to have their portfolio revalued. That would be an interesting proposition. I suspect the valuation will occur at times of the government's choosing, to advantage the government in the amount it might be able to rip off pensioners. That is the more likely to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, people are required to notify the department each time the value of their assets changes. Their pensions are adjusted accordingly. There are penalties involved if people fail to advise the department of a change that could lead to a debt. This matter of the changes that will occur in valuation will be a particularly important one, but things are all quite uncertain. There are no administrative arrangements in place&mdash;nothing we have been advised of&mdash;no determinations, no proposals for any rules. All of it is left vague and uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, the department wants to achieve a system which is administratively workable. I suspect, when it tells me it is saying that the issue is so complex and so difficult, that it cannot tell me now how it is going to make this administratively workable. If that is going to be a simple system for pensioners to understand, I do not know what could be a simple system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, this is a matter that we regard as so important that it should be referred to the Senate Community Affairs Committee. We have asked for a reference to that committee already to consider the issue of appropriate timing and regularity of valuation and, if possible, amendments to incorporate an appropriate scheme. It could provide for valuation at the election of beneficiaries. We will see whether the department wants to oppose that. If it is not going to propose specific suggestions as to how it is done, that is the course I would put forward, and we would let pensioners choose when they would like to announce their revaluations themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter is the budget savings and the numbers of people affected. I have already mentioned that in part. The government estimate of the number of people affected ought to be well known and understood. It is the sort of initiative that ought to have been the subject of a letter to every pensioner owning shares outlining the potential impact of this matter, and it ought to have been done before this legislation was proceeded with, in the same way that the wife pension was subject of such helpful advice that ensured that people understood how they were going to be affected. I do not know why this has not been done in this area, but I suspect that the department knew that people would have greater concern if it was made known to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth matter I want to deal with is the Meridian Investment Trust. The government has failed in this bill to assist investors in the Estate Mortgage trusts who have been adversely affected by the unrealised capital gains provisions. We now know that the government acknowledges that this is a matter of concern. The Estate Mortgage Investment Trust collapsed in 1990. Investors lost a lot of money at that time. The trust has now been relisted as the Meridian Investment Trust, and since that time investments have increased modestly but not to the point where the losses that have been made have been recouped. If these investments had remained listed, they would have been saved investments&mdash;in other words, they would not have been subjected to Labor's unrealised capital gains measure; they would have been saved&mdash;but because the trust was relisted they were no longer exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard today that the government intends to give people an ex gratia payment. But it is not going to put them back into the position they would have been in if these were saved investments. This government is so mean spirited that it wants to adopt the deeming provisions for these people before it adopts them for anybody else. It is an outrageous proposition. If the government thinks that it will get away with that, it has another think coming. I would like to think that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who is going to speak afterwards, will acknowledge that and support the amendment that we will propose. There will be an amendment to ensure that these investments are saved investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to the issue of friendly society bonds. There have been considerable representations to members and senators from the umbrella organisation for friendly societies, the Australian Friendly Societies Association. That organisation has asserted that provision should be made to treat prepaid investments, such as friendly society bonds, differently from products on which tax is not prepaid but on which the investor pays tax at their own marginal tax rate. The association argues that returns from prepaid tax products will necessarily be lower as the tax has been paid prior to the distribution to the investor. It has argued that its members will be adversely affected, prejudiced, under these new extended deeming arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The association claims that there are 400,000 pensioners with total investments of $2.8 billion. That is a very significant investment amount. It has made some suggestions involving introducing differential deeming rates and amending division 8A of the Income Tax Assessment Act to enable friendly societies to provide income stream products of an alternative character, to which pensioners might switch without penalty. I think those matters in time will become of very significant concern, particularly in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think it is important, in the context of this matter in particular, that the representations that have been made should be fully considered. Whether there should be changes to the deeming rules or whether tax legislation should be amended is a matter that should be examined by a parliamentary committee. We will be moving a reference on that matter to the Senate Community Affairs Committee. I want to see those particular issues examined in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The earnings credit scheme&mdash;and I hope some of my colleagues will discuss this matter&mdash;is a measure that is designed to produce savings for the government. It is designed to remove a number of people from eligibility for the full earnings credit to which they are now entitled to ensure that it can only be reclaimed over time. I suspect that, with the estimated savings of $93 million over the next four years, many of the people whom this was designed to assist will be very concerned when they become aware of the nature of these amendments that the government is forcing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The earnings credit arrangement needs to be understood. It provides the opportunity for people who have seasonal occupations&mdash;Santa Claus is often used as the example&mdash;with a very high level of income at a particular point of time to be able to apply that as a credit over time so that their earnings are within the normal allowance that is made to those folk who have earnings of up to $60 per fortnight before their benefit is affected. They will be able to spread those earnings over a period of time and not be disadvantaged simply because they had all their earnings at the one point in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What amazes me is that, while the amalgamation of jobsearch and newstart is claimed to be a simplification, it was only in July 1991 that we saw the government claiming significant benefits from introducing a new payment, which was to be the newstart allowance. The jobsearch payment existed before that. Here we have a change again, in a relatively short period of time, which will have associated with it costs of changing stationery and adjusting computers. Quite considerable administrative costs will be associated with the measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other concerns that we always have is that all too often these sorts of changes seem to produce another means of hiding the number of long-term unemployed. The department tells us that it will continue to publish statistics which distinguish between short-term and long-term unemployed. But that is merely an undertaking. There will be no requirement for it to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is right that, with the high levels of unemployment that we have, the mature age benefit be continued on the current basis. It is a benefit with pension conditions that assists those who are over 60 and unlikely to be able to get employment and exempts them from the activity test. The government had a sunset clause operating in relation to that, which was to cease on 30 June 1996. Obviously, with the high levels of unemployment that continue to exist in this country and the difficulties that the mature age experience, the situation could not be allowed where this benefit was not continued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should not be thanked for it. It is obviously a matter for which the government should be condemned. But the fact is that, notwithstanding the unemployment situation and the government's responsibility for it, an appropriate response in part is to have a mature age allowance. We do not oppose it, but it ought to be understood that the mean-spirited nature of this government is evident even in this matter. What the government seeks to do now is to introduce other conditions which are not as generous as were previously available. In other words, while recipients were paid on full pension conditions before, allowance conditions are now being introduced and there will be savings from that measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, however, that it will apply to women. Why does it apply to women now when it did not before? Because this is the government&mdash;notwithstanding its promises before the last election when it severely criticised us for holding out that we might do so&mdash;that promised it would not raise the pension age for women and is now progressively doing so. During the first year of this allowance the age at which women will be eligible for this allowance will be 60.5; so for six months some women will have to be eligible for the mature allowance, otherwise they would be disadvantaged relative to the position of men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to the other bill&mdash;the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pensions and Other Measures) Bill. The major issue that I wish to comment on, because it does involve some amendments I will be moving, relates to data matching. I will not rise to the bait about the impact of data matching. We still see it as being highly questionable. I know the government has been endeavouring to build it up as achieving certain outcomes. But we are going to meet it halfway. We will be proposing an amendment to the effect that the operation of data matching be extended for a further three years, to January 1999. But we certainly want to ensure that the efficacy of the process is something that is still tested. We certainly will not agree to your amendment that we will avoid reporting to parliament in relation to this measure on a regular basis&mdash;that is, yearly&mdash;by substituting three years. That is a measure that we will be opposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are giving you the entitlement to extend data matching to child-care assistance payments, merely because they are at the moment tested on the same basis as family payments. If you obtain information that somebody is cheating in one area, I guess it is fair enough that you ought to be able to use that information to deal with other areas in which the fraud may be occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not object to the changes that are being made in relation to the departure certificates.

It says that since 1973 the real value of the guardian allowance has dropped by 48 per cent and there has not been a real increase in the allowance since 1986. The increase in the payment still leaves the payment $10 a week short of the amount needed to meet the benchmark of 10 per cent of the married pension rate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this bill, the government is introducing three changes to the provisions in relation to rent assistance. It says, `Applaud&mdash;rent assistance is to be increased by $5 a fortnight for families with children.' But then it says quietly, under its breath, `The rent assistance threshold will be increased by $5 a fortnight.' That is, for a number of folk, the threshold which their income has to meet will be raised before they will be eligible for rent assistance. Of course, it says in relation to other people, those living in boarding houses and other rental type accommodation&mdash;lodges and certain retirement villages&mdash;who had a saved eligibility for rental assistance that they would no longer be eligible to receive the former payment. Their payment was to be frozen until it was removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall impact of these changes is that the government gets a net saving of $16.9 million over 3 1/4 years. So you have got $5 million a year being saved out of changes to rent assistance. I think it is mean spirited. It is hypocritical on the part of this government&mdash;there is another word for the honourable member for Moreton&mdash;to praise itself for the impact it will have on families through changes to rent assistance, but by ripping it off the older pensioners in the form it does we have about 310,000 recipients who will lose $3.75 a week as a result of the increase in the threshold.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening in the adjournment debate I want to put on the record some very good work that has been done by a number of Rotarians from a number of Rotary clubs in New South Wales. I refer to the Kokoda Hospital project which has been undertaken in New Guinea and which has been built, as I say, by a number of Rotarians from a number of different Rotary clubs across Australia, as well as members of Lions clubs and other non-service clubs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that 32 Rotary teams have been involved to date and also members of Lions and non-service clubs. Originally, this project at the Kokoda Hospital was intended to be jointly funded by the Australian and PNG governments, but I believe so far there has been no money forthcoming from the PNG government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on record the names of the people from my electorate who have been involved. I have had the pleasure of being able to assist them with their communications, with faxes backwards and forwards, in organising equipment and the like. As the House would appreciate, it is a rather remote area of New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From within the Lyne electorate, I mention people from Forster&mdash;Col Robinson, Jeff and Mark Bower; from Port Macquarie&mdash;Ray Lambert; and from Taree&mdash;Norm Jones, Bob Young, Bob Newling, John Ritchie, Rob Keen and Charlie Lelean. I think it is important to note particularly the effort that Charlie Lelean has put into it. He has played a major role in organising, designing and supervising the installation of the electrical equipment in the hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Charlie was there on 16 September this year, when the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating), accompanied by Julius Chan, opened the hospital. I think we all saw the press photographs that came back of the headgear. He certainly recognised the good work that the members of Rotary did at that hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project is going to come in under the $1.5 million budget. The work has included three staff cottages, two hikers cottages, an airport terminal at Kokoda and local health clinics at Soqeri and Menari, adjacent areas, in addition to the memorial hospital. It was indicated to me that, if the hospital had have been constructed on a commercial basis, if it had have gone out to tender for contractors to build, it would have been more like $4 million worth. The people in that area of Papua New Guinea are very grateful to the labour of love that has been provided by the Rotary members and Lions members who have travelled up there and camped in the area while they have been working on this construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of a little aside: I believe that after the Prime Minister opened the hospital a couple of the local tribes presented, as a gesture of goodwill, the Prime Minister with a couple of pigs. I do not know what the Prime Minister has done with the pigs since then. It will certainly be interesting to see whether they appear on his register of members' interests. I believe the Prime Minister's minders were thrown into a bit of turmoil when these pigs turned up because they could not not accept them because it would have been an insult to the tribes that presented them. I think the pigs were knocked out by some injections and flown back to Port Moresby. As I say, it will be interesting to see whether the pigs appear on the Prime Minister's register of members' interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of a further aside before my time is up, I wish to speak again of Charlie Lelean, a member of the Taree Rotary Club who did all the electrical work in the hospital. Very shortly he will be going up to Vietnam and doing exactly the same thing with the Fred Hollows Foundation and the factory that they are building in Vietnam to manufacture, at a very competitive rate, intraocular lenses to be used in clinics in the Third World. I commend Charlie and all the other Rotarians and Lions members who have been involved in these projects. The people of Australia should be justly proud of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Urban traffic congestion is a complex problem. As we head towards the 21st century, we need a new approach to transport policy which elevates the importance of public transport. A one-dimensional approach of simply building more roads is unacceptable, although for safety and other reasons we will need upgrades and new roads from time to time. But, to use a medical analogy, we cannot keep widening arteries forever without cutting into vital tissue. Cut too deep and you risk harming vital organs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the case in the community that I represent. For this reason, I vigorously opposed a proposed airport motorway in my electorate through the suburbs of Kalinga, Wooloowin, Clayfield and Kedron. I joined with the local community in opposing this proposal, which was reflective of an outdated transport department mentality indifferent to the importance of public transport and without due regard to the quality of life of local communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to representations, this proposal was dropped. I am delighted to say that since that time the state government has left behind the departmental philosophy mentioned before and has embraced a radical new public transport agenda encompassed in many state election commitments given recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change of approach is what I lobbied long and hard for in my local area. It will mean a huge state and local commitment to northern bus ways through Chermside and beyond, leading to express bus services along Gympie Road in peak hour; increased frequency and reliability of suburban rail services when the new inner city tunnels are completed; and, very importantly, a Brisbane airport rail link. These will be exciting developments for the northern suburbs of Brisbane in the years ahead. In the meantime, there are some traffic bottlenecks and dangerous intersections that must be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with Terry Sullivan MLA, the member for Chermside, over the past 2 1/2 years I have lobbied the state government to provide the money for the upgrading of Gympie Road to solve the problem of the Nundah bottleneck&mdash;the most significant traffic problem on the north side of Brisbane. I congratulate the Queensland transport minister, Mr Elder, on his announcing of the provision of $40 million for the upgrading of Sandgate Road at Nundah. Also along with Terry Sullivan I lobbied the transport department successfully to allocate $2.3 million to upgrade the intersection of Rode Road and Gympie Road to provide dedicated turning lanes from Rode Road into Gympie Road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also further areas of transport need in my electorate. Bus services are poor in Zillmere and Brighton, and I am now lobbying the council and state government to upgrade these services. The Residents Action Group of Zillmere, whose president is Mr Jim Freilich and secretary Mr Vern Pailthorpe, are seeking the introduction of a trial period redirecting the existing 96 bus to cater for the suburbs of Boondall and Zillmere, a one-hourly 96 bus service on week days and, on Saturdays and Sundays, a 96 bus service to cater for visiting hours at the Prince Charles and the Royal Brisbane hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bus services are also poor in Brighton after 6 p.m. and on weekends. There needs to be a significant upgrading of services after hours and on weekends in this area to connect with the new federally funded bus-rail interchange at Sandgate. There is also a need for better bus services connecting Prince Charles Hospital, Toombul, Burnei Brae and the Royal Brisbane Hospital. There is also a need for sound barriers at Deagon and for noise amelioration along the gateway at Nundah. These are matters I am seeking to resolve with the responsible tier of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within six weeks, the transport minister, Mr Elder, will be releasing the Brisbane inner northern suburbs transport study. I have put strongly the views of the community that the state government must rule out the east-west connection between Eagle Junction and Kedron and reject any substantial upgrading of Junction Road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is the role of the federal member to stand up and strongly articulate the needs of the community in these matters, which are so essential to the quality of life. There is nothing more important to our lives than the quality of the air we breathe, and there is nothing more destructive to the quality of the air we breathe than the motor car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To protect our fragile environment, we must commit ourselves to this radical public transport agenda, because we do not want to see our communities pulled apart by roads. Traffic affects our health, safety and work. The sickening screech of tyres and the too frequent sound of sirens which signify traffic accidents jolt our sense of security and wellbeing. The motor car is a necessary evil. It is essential for many of us in earning our living. As a community, we have to find the balance between the use of the motor car and the enhancement of our quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new radical transport agenda evolving in Brisbane and south-east Queensland I believe will achieve these important aims over the next few years. It will be Labor governments at the state, local and federal level that can put this agenda into action. It is not an agenda which is shared by our conservative opponents, who do not have any agenda at all for public transport and no concept of planning for quality of life. Quality of life is too important to leave to conservatives. It will be in south-east Queensland and Brisbane that Labor governments&mdash;local, state and federal&mdash;will solve this problem for the benefit of residents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The appointment of Mr Frank Lowy to the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia on 22 June this year is a scandal. In March 1992, Mr Lowy fiercely resisted an Australian Taxation Office demand for $18 million back taxes which was settled to his satisfaction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another dispute developed between the Lowy family and the ATO in March 1994. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> of 2 July  1994, Mr Mark Leibler, Melbourne based tax haven expert, once again sprang into action. Mr Leibler aggressively refused to cooperate with the ATO audit team. He and Mr Lowy also ignored a formal section 264 notice, which is a prosecutable offence. Mr Leibler also sought an interview with senior ATO officials. As Mr Lowy is reportedly a close friend of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the question must be asked: did Mr Leibler's representations bring about high level interference in Mr Lowy's favour?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lowy, acting on Mr Leibler's advice, would not answer questions and claimed to know nothing of the source of the funds. Incredibly, Mr Lowy claimed that the money was a capital injection from `unknown international sources'&mdash;I repeat `unknown international sources'. How lucky can you get? The dispute related to amounts totalling $47.8 million, $42.8 million being paid to a Lowy family company in January 1987 and $5 million in November 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax office claimed it was taxable income. Subsequently, the ATO audit team issued assessments for $21.4 million tax and referred the case to the DPP for action. It is not clear whether the reference was for non-compliance with the section 264 notice, the receiving of secret commissions or both. The DPP decided there was no case to answer. However, the Lowy family company was still liable for tax, penalties and interest to the value of $50 million to $51 million. Elements of the dispute then went before the AAT, and again the settlement was in the Lowy's favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several days later the case was mysteriously settled, and the Lowy family reached an agreement with the ATO to pay a total of $25 million, or half the tax outstanding. This settlement caused such distress to the audit team assigned to the Lowy case that the two tax investigators involved had to take stress leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the Lowy matter the ATO took advice from Mr Alan Goldberg QC which, I am reliably informed, was in Mr Lowy's favour. Mr Goldberg was the same `expert' who `cleared' the Coles Myer directors over the Yannon transaction. The AAT hearing in April 1995 provides some clues to this scandal. The hearing centred on the issue of confidentiality of three key documents held by the ATO. The ATO did not want to disclose these documents, as they feared that if advance warning was given evidence might be tailored and future investigations would be frustrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Significantly, the ATO documents referred to an entity based in the well-known tax haven, Liechtenstein. This entity, Yelnarf, was believed by the ATO to be linked to the Lowy family, who have a number of companies with the title Franley&mdash;Frank and Shirley Lowy. `Yelnarf' is, of course, `franley' spelt backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A settlement was reached only a few days after the AAT hearing. Why? If the money paid to Mr Lowy was from `unknown international sources, as he claimed, why was he willing to pay $20 million if it was not his money? Can anyone seriously believe that `unknown international sources' based in the tax haven of Liechtenstein would provide Lowy with $47.8 million? How did Mr Lowy and his legal adviser, Mr Leibler, avoid compliance with a section 264 notice? Above all, who authorised the reduction of Mr Lowy's tax bill from $50 million to $25 million?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lowy is one of Australia's richest men. He has a net worth of $860 million and a reported annual salary of $3.1 million. Yet he had his tax obligation halved and avoided tax investigation of his affairs. Is it a coincidence that the matter was settled shortly before Mr Lowy's appointment to the Reserve Bank board? The government owes honest Australian taxpayers an explanation for the Lowy taxation scandal. In conclusion, I seek leave to table the AAT decision and reasons in the Lowy matter dated 11 April 1995, which is in any case a public document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In July of this year I attended a ceremony in Geelong to present ISO 9002 accreditation to M. C. Herd Pty Ltd, a local meat processing company. It is timely that I raise this matter in the House, given recent debates in the parliament on industrial relations and the high level of industrial disputation in Queensland abattoirs at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">M. C. Herd is the first domestic abattoir in Australia to obtain ISO 9002 quality accreditation. I offer the congratulations of the House to the management and the workers of that company for achieving the most significant milestone in Australia's meat industry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This historic accreditation was achieved through a strong commitment by all levels of the Herd organisation&mdash;management and workers&mdash;to quality in production processes and quality in service to customers. The point I want to make is that this quality accreditation was achieved with the cooperation of the workers and their union representatives. This achievement won by workers, their union and the management of the company was reached in a spirit of cooperation, not confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process was not easy; the achievement of a vision which throws out the big challenge to managers and workers rarely is. But with persistence, trust, goodwill and a thirst to be the best, this company and its work force have reached the top in an industry which in the past has suffered an appalling industrial relations record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with great pride as Paul Conway, representing M. C. Herd staff, explained the workers' role and commitment to the process of quality accreditation. I listened with excitement as the owner, Frank Herd, outlined his commitment to quality accreditation and his vision for the company and announced a $2 million investment, which will create over 100 jobs in Geelong. I listened with pride again as the old warhorse from the AMIEU, Wally Curran, a man who has devoted his working life to the advancement of the conditions of meat workers in Victoria, spoke of the progress made at this company through cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">M. C. Herd is testimony to the fact that there is a better way to conduct industrial discourse in this country. This company is testimony to the fact that an enlightened management, a progressive union and work force and a cooperative industrial relations framework provided by a federal Labor government in Canberra can produce a visionary outcome equal to anywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company's pursuit of excellence in quality is built upon people working as a team. Fundamental changes in attitude and work practices have taken place in developing greater responsibility by the employees and the management to improve quality. The company has displayed great commitment to training the work force and improving the communication skills of its workers and throughout the enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">M. C. Herd is an example of how it can be done the modern Australian way in the 1990s&mdash;not the 1960s way that certain elements of the opposition would have us return to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our continent is the driest inhabited continent on Earth, yet we use our water as if it is an endlessly abundant resource. Given our present rate of water usage and Australia's projected population growth, our demand for water will exceed our current developed fresh water supplies by the year 2020. This is not a distant event to be dismissed and left to future generations to deal with. It is a crisis that we may face in only 25 years time and one which must be dealt with now. National Water Week, which concludes this Sunday, is aimed at raising awareness about the scope of the problem we face and the need for action. I wholeheartedly support these aims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our river systems are, quite simply, the lifeblood of the land which sustains us; yet we have drastically altered both the quality and the quantity of the water flowing in our rivers. The Murray River is a case in point. If water were not diverted from the Murray River, over 13,700 gigalitres of water would flow from its mouth at the South Australian town of Goolwa. Now, little more than 4,900 gigalitres of water enters Lake Alexandrina. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reducing the level of river flows so dramatically has endangered&mdash;if not destroyed&mdash;too many of the native flora and fauna species that rely on our wetlands and flood plains. The Murray cray, for instance, is now extinct in our state. Biodiversity is also threatened by the declining quality of the water in our rivers&mdash;a result of viewing our rivers as convenient receptacles of our waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The devastation of the river systems must not be dismissed as simply a `green' issue. As always, economics and environmental issues are intrinsically linked. For instance, the value of the agricultural product derived from the Murray-Darling catchment area exceeds $10 billion annually. In a nation so economically reliant on primary production, the destruction of our river systems amounts to economic suicide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly there is an urgent need for change and I would like to take this opportunity to commend South Australia's Brown government for its visionary response to this need&mdash;a response embodied in our state water plan. Amongst the many initiatives in this plan, the Brown government's commitment to addressing the degradation of the Murray River is particularly noteworthy. However, I am angered that it is an initiative that is being undermined by short-sightedness on the part of the Keating government. In relation to this point, I would like to quote from an excellent article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adelaide Advertiser</EMPHASIS> earlier this week. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Murray is dying. The experts believe it. Politicians are listening to the warnings and proposing dramatic changes in the way we use the river. The SA Premier, Mr Brown is leading the charge, with a plan to revitalise the river as part of national projects to celebrate in 2001 the centenary of Federation. Under the Brown plan, the Murray would undergo a huge clean-up. Drainage and effluent waters would be diverted away from direct toxic injection into the river; salt-level reductions and river management schemes would mean more, and cleaner, water for all. Such schemes are the stuff of major spending . . . Mr Brown is planning a levy system on water charges to finance SA's $35 million contribution . . . From Canberra, the initial response&mdash;at least under the umbrella of the 2001 program&mdash;has been to reject projects of this kind . . . Mr Brown is still awaiting an official Canberra response.</PARA>
<PARA>Such is the commitment of this government to sustainable use of our water resources. On the occasion of National Water Week, I am proud to reiterate the following commitment given in Adelaide last Friday evening by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier this year, the Liberal and National Parties made a commitment to work with the States and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission in undertaking a major rehabilitation program that would be completed for the Centenary of Federation . . . it is abundantly clear that, at current levels of Commonwealth funding, it will be impossible, even with all the best ideas and intentions of the Commission, to achieve sustainable land management in the Murray-Darling Basin within the next thirty years&mdash;if at all. Let me reassure you that the rehabilitation of the Murray-Darling Basin will be one of the key initiatives in the Coalition's Environment Policy for the next election.</PARA>
<PARA>Such is the commitment of the Liberal and National parties to the sustainable use of our water resources. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Time is a great healer, but it also distorts the memory. Perhaps Harold Lasseter, an Australian explorer, is a classic example of this process. He knew where the reef was. He had seen it; he could picture it, but he perished leading an expedition to claim it&mdash;because it was not there! Some claim that he was a con man. But distortions of this magnitude are not uncommon. Over recent months much has been said about the white picket fence. It has been adopted as the status symbol by conservatives as they recall their golden era&mdash;the Menzies era.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a product of industrial Australia. I was born, educated, married, lived and reared my family in the Hunter Valley, and my recollection of that golden era is not strong on white picket fences. I remember a steel industry that employed masses of people, mostly as labourers. I remember thousands of bicycles at change of shift. I remember the hundreds of workers who turned up daily at the gates in the hope of getting a day's work. Yet at the end of that era our steel industry imported steel products from Japan and Korea because they were cheaper. We had an industry that was not competitive. I remember a coal industry where whole towns provided the miners that slogged their guts out in an underground hell where disaster was never far away, and death did not have to be a violent one. I have seen dusted miners dying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the industrial unrest as workers fought for a fair wage. Life was cheap. I remember a waterfront where the work was done manually or with primitive machines while our exporters competed against increased mechanisation on foreign wharves. I remember extended families. Pensions were rare and meagre. Married women and mothers could not have a career unless they were widows, and then they worked for a pittance. There were no child-care centres then. I remember young married couples renting rooms, living with parents and renting sheds in backyards because they could not afford a block of land or a home. This was the golden era of the Liberals, and this is what they aspire to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today in the Hunter I see vast changes. We have a steel industry that is competitive on a worldwide basis. We not only export our steel products; we give our own manufacturing industry an edge when competing for international sales. I see the most efficient coal industry in the world producing record export sales through the largest coal loading facility in the world and at the same time feeding the largest group of electric generating facilities in Australia. I see Goninans making locos and rolling stock that are being sold overseas&mdash;an export that only a few years ago we would not have dreamt possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see ADI making fibreglass minehunters for our navy; developing a new industry that will place the Hunter on a world map for excellence in fibreglass and electronic technology. I see new suburbs with quality housing. I see excellent child-care facilities. I see aged and disabled people being supported by our most extensive pension network ever. I compare this with the golden era of the Liberals of my youth. I know which model has the greatest hope for our children, for our country, for our future. And I know which government had the vision and the determination to make it happen. So do all other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If by some unjust quirk John Howard does win the next election and takes this nation off in search of the distorted recollections of his youth&mdash;in search of that white picket fence that really existed only in films such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pollyanna</EMPHASIS> and in the mid-western American movies that they showed us to comfort us and make us look for some hope&mdash;then our nation is in for a rude shock.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) constantly raises issues in this chamber that have nothing whatsoever to do with his role or responsibilities as a member of the federal parliament. Presumably, his constant tirades against the very efficient and effective Victorian Liberal government are as a result of his apprehension&mdash;or perhaps a better word would be `comprehension'&mdash;about his prospects at the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, he is determined to indicate to his factional colleagues in Victoria that he would not mind having a tilt at Spring Street following his second enforced retirement from Canberra. The problem is that, whilst most of us here have become immune to his constant ranting and raving, when he sets out to involve a wider audience the time has come to challenge his activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you an example. In an endeavour to capitalise on well-founded community concern about French nuclear testing in the Pacific, the honourable member for McEwen distributed a letter throughout his electorate claiming that the Kennett government was planning to sell the Eastern Energy grid to the French government corporation Electricite de France. The letter was printed on official Parliament of Australia House of Representatives letterhead. Enclosed with the letter was a petition, which the honourable member invited his constituents to sign and return to him. He stated in the letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This petition will show the Kennett Liberal Government how we feel, and help me to stop any sale of our power grid to French companies.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter concerned was dated 14 September 1995. It had been public knowledge since 5 August, more than a month before the honourable member circulated his letter, that Electricite de France was no longer involved in any negotiations regarding the sale of Eastern Energy or, for that matter, any other energy business in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the member for McEwen was not going to be put off by something as unimportant as the truth. Instead, he asked his constituents to sign a petition which he claimed would help him stop something that had in fact already been stopped weeks before. Furthermore, the petition enclosed with the letter was not addressed to members of the Victorian parliament but to the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives. Not only was the wording of the petition completely inaccurate and misleading but anyone with a modicum of intelligence would know that the House of Representatives has nothing to do with the privatisation of state electricity distribution or generation companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, no matter what he may pretend to his constituents, the honourable member for McEwen has about as much chance of influencing the Kennett government as he has of retaining his seat at the next election&mdash;in a word, zilch, and that is probably a generous estimate. This whole exercise was nothing better than a hypocritical, unscrupulous and devious attempt at cheap political point scoring. It is also a sad reflection on the contempt with which the member treats his constituents. Does he take them for fools? Apparently so. What an unhappy and inexcusable state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here he is trying to beat up a non-existent issue while at the same time ignoring the significant matters which are causing major problems for many of his constituents. Where is his petition on the appalling effects of the national debt, on long-term and youth unemployment or on the fact that, under this Labor federal government, the gap between the haves and the have-nots has grown wider on a daily basis and is still growing? He is strangely silent on these critical matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hardly surprising that so far it seems that the honourable member's efforts to mislead and confuse have had little effect. Although he circulated this scandalous piece of literature almost six weeks ago, so far none of the petitions have seen the light of day in this chamber. Of course, it could be that the electors of McEwen are already awake to the member's motives so none of them have bothered to sign it. Alternatively, perhaps the honourable member is simply too embarrassed to present the petitions because, if he did, even his colleagues would be forced to question the abuse of the system. Or perhaps he is just using this exercise as a covert method of collecting names and addresses, which were provided to him in good faith, to build up data for use during the forthcoming election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately for the present member for McEwen&mdash;but very fortunately so far as his long-suffering constituents and the nation are concerned&mdash;it does not matter what sort of databank he may be assembling, how much taxpayers' money he is willing to waste in sending out palpably misleading letters or how far he is willing to go to try to divert the electors' attention from the real issues, it will not save him on election day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the debate in the Main Committee on the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1995. This is a very important bill which enjoys the support of all parties in the parliament. It is important to recognise that many bills do receive broad-ranging support. I think there is very great concern in the Australian community over the question of endangered species, over the question of the environment, and in many of these bills the government does receive the support of the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we have an appalling record in the area of the environment and in the area of endangered species. Australia has one of the worst records anywhere in the world. Only last year we received a terrible environmental scorecard. In the 207 years of European settlement to 1995 we have lost forever 100 species of plants and another 1,000 are vulnerable to extinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSIRO records that 15 per cent of the world's endangered plants are in Australia and animals are also threatened. It is incumbent on us, as members of parliament, to do whatever we can to make sure that those species of flora and fauna which are endangered are protected and that their long-term survival is ensured. The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill, while not directly in the area of all endangered species, is certainly a step in the right direction. As has been indicated by the shadow minister in the other place and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) as his representative in the lower house, the coalition is happy to support the government in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are amendments to a bill which was originally introduced by a coalition government in 1982. These amendments specifically provide for a number of matters. Firstly, commercial harvests of native Australian and certain species of overseas wildlife must be conducted on a sustainable basis, with no detriment to the long-term survival of any species. Secondly, management programs and declarations for controlled specimens, for the commercial export of native plants, animal products and live fish and invertebrates, can only be approved where the appropriate state or territory legislation is in place. The requirement places the initial responsibility on individual states to ensure that any commercialisation of wildlife species will be sustainably utilised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide that, in conjunction with amendments relating to management programs and controlled specimens provisions, a maximum period applies for which a management program can be approved. This amendment will close an anomaly currently existing in the act, which presently allows management and controlled specimens programs to operate indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for greater flexibility in granting permits for the private importation of species, to more effectively implement appendix II of CITES&mdash;listed in schedule 2 of the principal act&mdash;relating to species which, though not endangered with extinction, could become so unless stringent regulation of trade is undertaken. The bill provides for the implementation of appendix III of CITES&mdash;in schedule 2A of the proposed amendments&mdash;which includes any species which any party identifies as being subject to regulation within its jurisdiction for the purpose of preventing or restricting exploitation and needing the cooperation of other parties in the control of trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for a new offence relating to the cruel treatment of live animals being imported or exported. This provision is targeted at individuals or bodies corporate who smuggle wildlife. The new provision operates in addition to existing penalties for the import or export of wildlife without appropriate approvals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years I have often wondered that in Australia it has been quite legitimate and legal to poison large numbers of native birds and yet their exportation has been banned. I sometimes wonder about the logic of this. It is almost as though we in Australia are allowed to destroy these native species but we are not prepared to allow the rest of the world to enjoy them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also seeks to strengthen enforcement powers of inspectors appointed under the act, and it works towards simplifying administrative procedures, ensuring that penalties are consistent with other Commonwealth legislation. The bill provides that the maximum number of native household pet animals that may be exported is limited to two and eliminates the ownership requirements for pet birds. The existing ownership provision has proven to be difficult to establish, and not of consequence in establishing the validity of an application for a permit to export household pets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to safeguard the Australian environment from the illegal introduction of exotic birds by introducing a national registration system for certain species. One of the worries is that, when exotic bird species are introduced to Australia, diseases may come with them which may then run rampant throughout the native bird population, with debilitating consequences for the future of those birds. The bill also seeks more stringent control over native wildlife species that are to be exported as inter-zoological garden transfers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned before, the coalition supports the broad thrust of this bill. There has also been widespread support in the Australian community for the principles of this particular bill. We must recognise that Australia is an island continent. It is the only country to inhabit an entire continent. As such, Australia is privileged to have a unique range of flora and fauna, but accompanying this privilege is a responsibility to ensure that that flora and fauna are protected. While we always enjoy seeing exotic species, it is absolutely vital to ensure that when we import those species we do not do so in a way that could severely disadvantage the continued existence of our own native species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of state governments have objected to some provisions of the bill. These include the provision which requires the states to legally protect and manage the harvesting of species for export&mdash;regardless of whether, in the view of the state, there is any need to do so for conservation purposes&mdash;and the provision for the artificial imposition of a five-year time limit on management program approvals and automatic suspension of approval of management programs with unrestricted approval time limits. Other state governments have fully welcomed the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been some worries about the costs to states and territories of assisting in implementing schemes such as the exotic bird registration scheme and the costs to state and territory bodies in assisting in enforcing the act. I hope the government is prepared to take on board some of these concerns in the committee stage. It is important when we have a bill which is broadly supported by all parties in the parliament that, when there is the odd glitch, hiccup or problem which could easily be resolved through amendments, the government takes those on board. I am confident the government will look at these matters. I am hopeful the government will pick up the concerns expressed by people who, while they might broadly support the legislation, have problems with some elements of the detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conservation groups have also pointed out that the act should be strengthened to cover the import and export of seeds, dead fish&mdash;to protect a threatened Australian species&mdash;and all live plants, including reproductive material, with the only exceptions being for environmentally benign and commonly traded species. I understand that the World Wide Fund for Nature Australia will be suggesting some changes to the legislation along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset, Australia really has an appalling record in the area of the environment since European settlement some 207 years ago. We have lost a hundred species of plants and another 1,000 are vulnerable to extinction. It is necessary for governments of all political colours to look at this major problem. In a country like Australia, it really is totally unacceptable that we have lost a hundred species of plants and that we have so many others which are currently vulnerable to extinction. We have similar problems with our fauna. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a nation, we should recognise that we hold our environment in trust for future generations and that resources, wherever necessary, ought to be put into preserving endangered species of flora and fauna. I hope the government believes in this principle as well. However, after 12 years in office, the situation has not improved. I would hope that in the remaining few months of this government's term in office it is prepared to pick up the points that I have made and act on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also helpful to note that in Australia since 1950 we have lost one-third of our forests and one-half of our rainforests, and that we have major problems in areas currently under agriculture, due to salinity and erosion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a nation, we really do not have a lot to be proud of, but I am pleased that the parliament is debating the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill. It is important that we participate in the world community, and this bill follows our ratification of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna, in 1976, and our ratification of the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is an amendment to legislation originally introduced by the coalition, so for a very long time both sides of politics in Australia have been generally focused in the same direction, although in some points of detail we might differ. I ask government members to consider various concerns expressed in relation to the detail of the bill because it is absolutely vital for the future that we get this important bill right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been indicated by other speakers from the opposition, we support the thrust of the bill. We have minor concerns about some aspects but we would hope that in the consideration in detail stages the government will adopt those suggestions so that a bill which we see as positive can be made even more beneficial for the future of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill is very interrelated with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora, CITES, which Australia signed and ratified during 1975-76, the Convention on Biological Diversity, which we ratified in 1993, and the Australian Nature Conservation Agency report of 1994 which stated that `the illegal importation of exotic birds has increased dramatically over the past few years'. That report indicated that the current protections and regulations are unsatisfactory. That is the germ of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), indicated, the parties are largely in accord with the need for this legislation. I do not want to reiterate at length the realities that the previous speaker indicated with regard to Australia having much to be ashamed of in previous decades. One can only note the essential misunderstanding of new colonists, new settlers, towards ecological balance in this country, the encroachment of society, of urbanisation, the introduction of exotic species&mdash;both fauna and flora&mdash;and the impact these things have had. Quite clearly, Australia has had  responsibility for a large and diverse area and now has a few things to answer for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is worth noting that Australia's thrust&mdash;and, as I say, it is largely supported, I understand, by the opposition&mdash;on the international stage has been quite worth while in recent years. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 20 November 1994 it is worth repeating the thrust of an article by Peter Pockley in which he talked about Australia's role at the last CITES meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia played a prominent role in steering through the meeting more scientific criteria for future "listing" of endangered species. The tortuous process was chaired by Jim Armstrong from the West Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He also noted that Australia was active in attempting unsuccessfully to list the giant Triton shell. They were unsuccessful when the criticism of some delegates showed that it was unlikely to get the required two-thirds majority. Australia played roles there with regard to the rare minke whale and also with what is becoming a vital issue&mdash;the question of the very lucrative trade resulting from the very strong demand in South-East Asia's growing economies for derivatives of tiger and rhinoceros, and similar products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to reiterate at length the details of this bill, because many speakers have and will talk about what it specifies. But I want to give some kind of a feeling for the background against which we actually are endeavouring internationally to do something about these measures. I also want to cite a number of articles about the very serious problems that are on the horizon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Age</EMPHASIS> of 9 March 1995, for instance, an article talked about the question of tigers. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In China, the world's largest exporter of manufactured tiger products, the tiger population has dropped from 2000 in the 1960s to only 50 today.</PARA>
<PARA>Also in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, on 1 December last year, an article talked about the very big issue of oriental medicines and the demand push that is resulting from the fact that oriental medicines are especially popular in China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The booming economies and personal incomes of South-East Asia have caused demand and prices to soar, lifting the international trade in wildlife products to an estimated $US6 billion-a-year ($A7.8 billion) business. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the pharmacies of Hong Kong, a two-pound rhino horn sells for as much as $45,000. In Taiwan, a bowl of tiger penis soup (to boost virility) goes for $320, and a pair of eyes (to fight epilepsy and malaria) for $170. Powdered tiger humerus bone (for treating ulcers, rheumatism and typhoid) brings up to $1,450 a pound&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It is worth looking at this internationally. We are part of the reality that is trying to combat these types of activities and one of the provisions in this legislation goes to achieving that. It is worth looking at the realities of how the various international forces in this are interconnected. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Atlantic Monthly</EMPHASIS>, in November 1994, Kenneth Brower put the interrelationship of various countries, poachers, et cetera in some perspective when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taiwan's trade in endangered wildlife extends far beyond China's borders, creating an odd international brotherhood. The illicit trade in wildlife unites Laotians hunting tigers in the jungle and good old boys poaching bears in the North American woods, black Zimbabwean rhinoceros poachers and blond members of South Africa's defense force, who reportedly have for years been funding their operations with profits from illegal diamonds, elephant ivory, and rhinoceros horn. The trade unites young Taiwanese tuna fishermen poaching the last wild reefs of Oceania for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tridacna gigas</EMPHASIS>, the giant clam, with their wishful old countrymen who imagine that eating the clam's adductor muscle will give them lower blood pressure and a calmer spirit.</PARA>
<PARA>So this is not just a matter that affects this country alone. We know that the United States, in particular, has moved for bans on Taiwan in regard to a number of products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the home front, a matter of concern was the report by the TRAFFIC organisation of a survey they did of traditional Chinese medicine outlets in Sydney. They discovered that a significant portion&mdash;from recollection, it was over 60 per cent&mdash;of the products being sold there boasted, though in some cases perhaps mistakenly or fraudulently, of having rhinoceros, tiger, musk deer and other endangered species as ingredients. New South Wales legislation currently trails miserably behind the situation in Victoria where bans on such retail sales are far greater. As I understand it, New South Wales has provisions which go to the issue of wholesale distribution, but do not tackle retail issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CITES, the convention which is at the stem of this, does seem to be dealing with some of the big issues around the place. I have referred to the last conference in Fort Lauderdale, but at the previous meeting, in May 1994, they looked at guidelines on ranching marine turtles, procedures for the disposition of confiscated live animals and a review of a universal tagging system for the identification of crocodilian skins. It is worth noting, once again, that Australia was extremely active in the question of rhinoceros horn and tiger bone products, and that the growth of South-East Asian economies is having a very big impact as a demand push factor for these products. So while there have been a few things we have had to hang our heads about in the past, Australia has been fairly active on these matters in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular legislation does go to a number of aspects. It talks about management programs and declarations for the control of specimens and for the commercial export of native plants, animal products and live fish. It makes sure that the states and the territories have a very real role, and it deals with a maximum period for those management plans. I understand that one of the areas of objection is that there are maximum periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation provides for greater flexibility in granting permits for private importation of species, to more effectively implement appendix II of CITES. Appendix II covers species which are not currently threatened with extinction but which may become so unless trade is subject to strict regulation. An export permit in relation to appendix II is required. On 23 November 1994, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) announced that the Australian population of the saltwater crocodile had been listed under this particular appendix. That is an instance of an Australian problem getting into the international debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a new offence with regard to cruel treatment of live animals being imported or exported, and it operates in addition to the existing penalties. There is, furthermore, a strengthening or furthering of powers of seizure, which at the same time goes to the questions of search of premises and conveyances, and allows inspectors the right to conduct frisk searches. I do not think that this has been subject to much criticism about going too far or limiting people's rights, given the overall problem of attempting to counter what is becoming an increasingly lucrative international trade that is attracting people coming over here to do the job themselves rather than rely on locals. We know that a significant number of people from overseas have been detained in recent years in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation of course looks at a national registration scheme with regard to the illegal introduction of exotic species, trying to at least understand which species are here and their numbers and possession and, therefore, to have a degree of protection in relation to the spread of diseases that could have a very debilitating effect upon our native wildlife. It also restricts the number of native household pet animals that can be taken out of the country, thereby tackling a loophole where people supposedly have these animals for one purpose but, in reality, have them essentially for commercial reasons and take large numbers out of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A variety of measures in this legislation also try to do something about the burgeoning numbers of exotic birds. We have seen the kind of environmental depredation that occurs from the unfortunate accidental release of fish, but it also occurs equally with birds, and we have seen the problems that arise there. The legislation enhances the powers with regard to inspection and seeks to ensure that Australia does cooperate when other countries see a risk of their own species being endangered and therefore seek international action. Part of this legislation goes towards ensuring that Australia adheres to that CITES requirement and to making sure that, to the maximum possible extent, our laws are in conformity with that requirement. As was indicated earlier, the opposition and the government are largely in accord on the legislation, and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to the words of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and I certainly endorse virtually everything that he said. Australia is starting to lead the world in the breeding back of many of these endangered species. In my own electorate we have projects going in that regard at the Western Plains Zoo at Dubbo, a visit to which I highly recommend to members who may not have visited that establishment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not only breeding back a number of endangered Australian species such as the bilby, the mallee fowl and certain macropods but also taking on a number of overseas endangered species which we have had tremendous success with. The Przewalski horse is one where we have been so successful that it is almost embarrassing. Earlier this year we took the first consignment of horses back to the wild in Mongolia where they originated. At present there are none existing in the wild in that part of the world and the delegation that went from Dubbo with those horses was very warmly welcomed. It is a bit like the Australian kangaroo being made extinct in the wild and some overseas country breeding them up and returning them to Australia. The delegation was welcomed with open arms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also about to begin a breeding program with the black rhino which will have us leading the world. The numbers of the black rhino in Zimbabwe and other African countries have plunged drastically over the last few years. Dubbo has also had success with breeding cheetahs and the zoo would like to start breeding Asiatic lions in the not too distant future, another very endangered species. I think the Gir forest in Asia has only about 200 of these left in the wild. And in the future we would like to get into breeding back tigers and perhaps African elephants. We have the only African elephants in Australasia in Dubbo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I certainly endorse the words of the previous speaker whereby we have to look to educating and putting greater pressure on many of the Asian countries that still persist with their ignorant and barbaric quasi-medical practices. I acknowledge we have much to learn from them in other areas but that is one area that we should give some attention to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1995 goes, the explanatory memorandum says that the purpose of the bill is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to improve import and export regulatory controls ensuring the long term conservation of native wildlife, consistent with Australia's international obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on Biological Diversity.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments provide that commercial harvests of native Australian and certain species of overseas wildlife must be conducted on a sustainable basis with no detriment to the long-term survival of any species. The amendments also provide that management programs and declarations for controlled specimens for the commercial export of native plants, animal products and live fish or invertebrates be approved only where appropriate state or territory legislation is in place. This requirement places the initial responsibility on individual states to ensure that any commercialisation of wildlife species will be sustainably utilised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My particular comments on this bill relate to a deficiency in this area. I acknowledge that we are allowing commercial export of native plants, animal products and live fish or invertebrates but there is one glaring omission here. I believe it should also extend to certain species of native birds. We are permitted to export species of exotic birds but not native birds at all on a commercial basis. I believe there is room in this country to do so to the benefit of the environment, the economy, the farmers and, in particular, the birds that I am about to mention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the several hundred species of birds that we have in this country, I am talking about only four: they are the greater Sulphur-crested cockatoo, Cacatua galerita; the galah, Cacatua roseicapilla; the little corella, Cacatua sanguinea; and the long-billed corella, Cacatua tenuirostris. I believe they are in much larger numbers now than was the case before European settlement in this country. This is because of our crops and water storage systems. They have bred in plague proportions, particularly around areas where we grow summer crops. The habitats of these birds have also expanded vastly. In some areas, they are present in hundreds of thousands&mdash;almost plague proportions. They are particularly a nuisance when farmers sow crops, around the time of harvest and also when the grain is being stored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly expand on that. It is very frustrating trying to sow crops when these birds flock in great numbers and eat the grain as it is being put into the soil. The farmers virtually have to ride shotgun on their tractors to get the grain into the ground. When the seed is sown, they stay in their thousands and scratch it out. Near harvest time, when the grain ripens, the flocks emerge and almost darken the sky. They eat the grain, whether it be sorghum, sunflower or whatever. When the grain is being stored, they come in their tens of thousands and try to get it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the natural environment, these particular species become very aggressive when they are in these sorts of numbers. They drive out other birds and destroy their nesting sites. In itself, this upsets the delicate avian ecological balance that exists along many of our rivers. I believe that should be acknowledged. In addition to that, because they breed in such numbers due to the fact that they feed on the crops, they defoliate and ringbark many magnificent trees and end up killing them. This is also something that we should take into consideration. Of course, they do other damage of a lesser nature. They attack and damage powerlines. From time to time, many people in rural areas will also have the cables from their TV antennas chewed through by these birds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are certain things you are allowed to do to overcome these problems. I will just run through a few of them. Shooting these birds is one of the most common things. It is not actually the killing of the birds, as such&mdash;because they can only be shot one at a time, and we are talking about thousands of birds&mdash;but the noise of the shooting that drives them off. However, they eventually get used to the noise and shooting becomes not only expensive but also largely ineffective. Scarecrows are also used, particularly on orchards. While they can be effective in some circumstances, their use is certainly limited on broadacre crops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various other methods have been used to deter these birds, such as using high pitched sounds, but, again, these have limited use. The most effective method of all is trapping. I am not talking about mist nets, which are illegal, but ground nets whereby a bird is put in a cage as a decoy, other birds assemble in the area and then the ground trap is triggered, springs over the birds and traps them underneath. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all very well, but you are then confronted with the problem of what to do with these birds. You can put them in cages, as the National Parks and Wildlife Service encourages you to do, and drive them out to a distant place and release them. But unless you travel hundreds of kilometres, what do these birds do? They fly back again within a short period of time. Running them around the country is  an expensive thing to do, and it is limited with the numbers&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Nehl" NAMEID="AE4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, you are moving the problem to someone else. That is unsatisfactory. Mrs Kirner, the ex-Premier of Victoria, when she was environment minister in that state, advocated putting the birds in 44-gallon drums and gassing them. That does not excite me at all. It is not something that we want to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The birds can be gathered up and sold on the domestic market. But there is little scope for this method of disposal. The domestic market is very limited. Once you have sold, at the most, a few hundred of these birds, the market is flooded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The birds can be killed outright by clubbing them to death, or by walking around on top of the nets and crushing them with your boots. That is legal, but I find it inhumane and horrifying, as well as being an incredible waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very logical answer as to what we can do with these birds: that is, to sell them overseas. We are only talking about sending them to acceptable countries, and I will deal with that later. For some reason the National Parks and Wildlife Service finds overseas sale unacceptable. If you look at it from the point of view of the birds, it would be much more preferable to be sold to a wealthy American and be pampered in a proper aviary than to be crushed to death in Australia. If I was a bird I know which option I would take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also legal to poison these birds. It would be all very well if you could use 1080, but that is quite limited in its application. Usually, farmers will use organophosphorus poisoning on grain trails, which results in a very painful and inhumane death for the birds. Again, that is something that I find quite distasteful and unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These birds can be legally disposed of in their thousands&mdash;or illegally in some circumstances&mdash;but apart from the undesirable features that I have mentioned, many non-target birds are also picked up. I have reports of 15 to 20 species of non-target birds being poisoned when this method is used. Whichever way you look at it, selling these birds legally on the export market would be the way to go. But the government will not allow it. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Nehl" NAMEID="AE4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, I think it makes a lot of sense. You can export non-native birds from this country now; they are bred from exotic species imported into Australia. But you are not allowed to export native birds. I cannot see the logic of it at all. There is a bureaucratic mechanism already in place which would ensure that only four species of birds would be sent out. It would not open the way for endangered species to be sent out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are allowed to export native animals. Why is it that we cannot export native birds when the need is clearly there? We even export sensitive native animals, such as koalas. I support the government in doing that. I know some people oppose it, but if we send koalas to Japan we know very well that the Japanese will look after them to the very best of their ability. They will devote enormous amounts of money for research on koala diseases. In fact, Japan spends more money on research into the diseases of koalas&mdash;which is urgently needed&mdash;than Australia would spend in a generation. It is quite proper that we allow koalas to go out of this country, as long as very strict controls are maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look at the export mechanism that is in place now for non-native birds. There are about 10 costly procedures that have to be gone through. Anyone who is an exporter has to have a certified quarantine establishment licence. The overseas importer of our birds has to have a certified quarantine establishment licence also, which makes sure that these birds do not end up in some sort of backyard, shonky place where they would be maltreated&mdash;not something any of us would approve of. The Australian exporter has to have a CITES licence, a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora licence, and this is issued by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and there is a cost to that. It used to be $40; I do not know what it is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All avian species destined for overseas must be inspected by a qualified government veterinary officer within 24 hours of being sent out of this country. As a result of that inspection, a health certificate is issued. A numbered seal is then attached to the cage opening and that seal cannot be broken until the bird has been exported. The identification of the avian species, to make sure the right ones are in there, is done by non-government bodies at no cost to the government. Since 1950, this has been available to exporters as a free service by ornithologists who come from either the Australian Museum or an A-class zoological garden, and they issue a document. In this regard, there has not been one case of fraud in this country that I know of in all the time that this system has been operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The airports have holding facilities for avifauna, which are the responsibility of the airline companies, and the birds are housed according to a code of practice laid down by the International Air Transport Association. The exporter must sign one of these IATA forms indicating that all the packaging and health standard requirements are met. One must have an export customs clearance, which, again, involves more money, but is a further check; and one must have a customs recheck for any anomalies. Customs check that the applicant is a signatory to the CITES agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, upon arrival in the importing country, the overseas country, the consignment is met at the airport by an animal quarantine official who inspects the species and examines the seal on the cages. The birds are not allowed to be released until they go to the proper, licensed, private, quarantine facility. So there is a very good mechanism, a very thorough mechanism, in place now. Nobody can say that, if we opened up to exporting native birds out of this country, it would be done in an improper manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other advantages as well as that, of course, apart from its being better for the birds that are otherwise killed, better for the farmers and better for the economy. The government could earn royalties from this. These birds are being smuggled out of the country now, and are making from $5,000 to $20,000 in some instances. Even if we charged $100 for these birds, here is an export industry that we could have worth tens of millions of dollars to Australia. It would also, I believe, have the other advantage of taking the pressure off smuggling&mdash;not only smuggling other species out of Australia, but smuggling some of these rare parrots out of Indonesia and out of the north part of South America. Countries such as Suriname have some very rare parrots indeed, and it is a tragedy that these birds are being smuggled into places in America where there are wealthy bird collectors who want these spectacular birds. They could be having Australian birds, all legal and above board. Hopefully, that would replace some of this smuggling that takes place elsewhere. I commend this suggestion of the government. It could perhaps take it on board and trial it for a couple of years. I am sure it would work well, as it works well with every other species of animal that we export from this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too rise to speak in support of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1995. It is, from my point of view, rather pleasing to hear opposition members supporting the bill in this place, and I note that in the Senate in September Senator Kemp from Victoria also rose to speak in support of this bill. It is something that concerns everyone regardless of where our political affiliation lies, and that is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill itself forms part of Australia's commitment to further honouring two important conventions on the protection of wildlife: the 1976 Convention on Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, CITES, and the 1993 Convention on Biological Diversity, both of which Australia ratified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to improve the controls our authorities are able to exercise and to ensure the long-term conservation of wildlife in Australia. In a nutshell, it will strengthen our power to prevent trade exploitation which endangers any species. Whilst no authority in the world can actually stamp out some forms of exploitative trade, this bill goes a long way towards stamping out certain practices, and that in its turn is another step towards protecting those species which are already threatened with extinction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to give some background on the nature of this trade. Figures compiled last year by the international monitoring agency TRAFFIC indicate that every year some five million birds, 25,000 primates and 10 million reptiles are taken from the wild to be sold elsewhere. Their fate, as we all know, can be terrible. Millions of birds undoubtedly end up bound and stuffed into things like suitcases, where, we have seen via our televisions, they die from shock and asphyxiation or dehydration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall a few cases recently where Australian customs officers have found birds in exactly this condition. For example, at the end of last year a particularly pathetic attempt to smuggle several Major Mitchells and a gang-gang cockatoo out of the country made the headlines in Sydney. The birds had been tightly bound with electrical tape and had not been fed or watered before they were stuffed into plastic pipes. Three were already dead. The rest were in shock and probably some of those did not survive either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Birds are not the only victims of this type of treatment. Snakes and lizards have been found crammed half-frozen into empty video cassettes. On one occasion Northern Territory customs officers seized 58 blue-tongue lizards packed in an air express box about 30 centimetres wide. I suppose it is fair to say that any creature worth tens of thousands of dollars in another country is a potential victim of such treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to bring to the attention of the chamber an example of victimisation of creatures from Tasmania. I spoke in the House last year about the Tasmanian sea dragon from the south-eastern waters of Tasmania. Sea dragons have been systematically caught, slaughtered, then dried and processed to be sold as an aphrodisiac in the Asian region. This in itself is an exploitation of a minor species. The Tasmanian sea dragon is a very rare minor species and, if nothing is done to protect it in its natural habitat, it will become extinct, as so many others have in the past. It is inherent in our duties as members of this parliament to put into place protection via legislation to assist these types of animals to be saved. And it is not only animals, of course; it is plant life as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst reports of this type of smuggling and desecration of our wildlife are disturbing, I am pleased to be able to say that Australia is taking a tougher stance against it. This bill in itself includes an amendment which makes the cruelty I have described in itself an offence, and anyone found guilty of this offence may find themselves behind bars for up to two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, the bill makes it easier for customs officials to frisk suspect persons and it removes the defence of not having the animals directly in their possession. It should be noted, too, that the introduction of the bill coincides with the peak nesting season for many of our native birds. I trust that we will continue to get bipartisan support so as to let this have an impact now and in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exporting birds or other wildlife is not the only issue here. The government is also concerned about the risks associated with exotic birds getting into this country. There is a great potential for exotic birds to form self-sustaining colonies which could pose a real threat to the native wildlife populations of plants and animals in Australia, as well as to our aviculture industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is understood that since 1992, when a ban was lifted on exotic birds being brought into the country, some 50 new species of birds have been introduced. There is a major question here as to whether or not they remain in captivity. One would hope that they do and that they have, but that is another matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill addresses this concern with the introduction of a national exotic birds registration scheme. It has been developed in close consultation with the aviculture industry, with bird keepers and with the states and territories. It is hoped that this scheme will totally incorporate an inventory of all exotic birds in Australia, and that it will enable us to effectively manage exotic bird populations and check against new ones coming in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It provides a national focus that allows some flexibility to the states and territories to impose additional measures if they see fit to do so. This scheme will assist the legal trade in exotic birds. In so doing it will further discourage the illegal trade which I described earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the scheme will need to be assessed for effectiveness some way down the track. To this end, an advisory committee to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories will be established to advise on and monitor the scheme. I have every confidence that it will prove to be an invaluable component of the country's conservation strategy. If we do not get into the business of conserving our wildlife and our plant life now, there will be no such wildlife and plant life for future generations. We have to be responsible now and put all types of restrictions and laws into place for protection of the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should like to reiterate that the bill does not centre on the trade of birds alone. It provides provisions to crack down on illegal traders of any species, be it plant, animal, fungus or whatever. The bill also extends the offence of possession of illegally imported animals and plants to the progeny of those specimens. It tightens the regulations relating to the import of hunting trophies. It also increases inspectors' powers to stop, search and question suspected traffickers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that the CITES convention did was to formally recognise the need for international cooperation if we are ever to have any real impact on the illegal trade of wild flora and fauna. Australia already has an excellent international reputation for its conservation stance, although in this area it is not good enough to rest on our laurels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us prohibits the importing of wildlife specimens contrary to the laws of a foreign country, thereby assisting other countries to enforce their laws and maintain a global focus on the conservation effort. Without such cooperative efforts, any attempt to stem the international smuggling industry would be doomed. Australia is playing a leading role in fighting that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the purpose of this bill is to improve the controls our authorities are able to exercise to ensure the long-term conservation of wildlife. In a nutshell, it will strengthen our powers to prevent any trade exploitation which endangers any species from Australia. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to support the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill because I think it improves the legislation. However, in my view there are still a lot of areas which could be improved. This legislation covers an area in which people have become emotional and irrational. To give an example of that, the government of the day, which was the Liberal-National party government, in 1960 decreed that there would be a total ban on the export of all Australian fauna. It was decreed that on 1 January it would all stop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was working for a company that sold animals to zoos throughout the world, which operated out of Adelaide at the time. The main Australian fauna exported was kangaroos. The company carried its own insurance, so it had to make sure conditions were good. If there was a five per cent loss on a shipload of kangaroos to America, all hell would break loose. The company really did look after its product. That was not surprising because it was getting, in 1958 money, #125 per animal delivered live to New York. It was a very lucrative business. This business was stopped overnight on 1 January 1960. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towards the end of 1958, we opened up kangaroo meat exports from Australia. That meat was sold to Germany. It was sold as Australian venison&mdash;and kangaroo meat does taste a bit like venison, although the grain structure is very different. In the first year, that business saw the demise of probably some 100,000 kangaroos. They were just slaughtered. That business grew until, overnight, the Germans stopped the import because of the appalling hygiene standards we were then applying. That was an indictment of the greed and lack of care that went into an industry that could have been very beneficial to Australia. Incidentally, it dropped the price of meat from seven pence to tuppence a pound. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That shows the stupidity of the situation where a government acts at the behest of pressure groups&mdash;as governments still do today&mdash;to stop export by an industry in which there was very good control, control which was forced by economics. The companies did not pay if the product arrived dead. That led to the establishment of an industry where the product was exported dead. Apparently, the logic was that exporting kangaroos live depleted the fauna, whereas exporting them dead did not. I thought then that that was Liberal Party logic&mdash;something which I have never been able to fathom. Unfortunately, the same intellectual rigour seems to have affected my own government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of things in this legislation need to be looked at. There is a section where, for exporters who propose to export native animals, the government can dictate that they must get an ongoing commitment from the people overseas as to what the animals are going to be used for and how they are going to be looked after&mdash;that is when they are exporting from Australia. On the other hand, it is also quite clear in the legislation that once the animals go overseas we have absolutely no control over them. It seems to me to be a little odd. If there can be no control of it, what is the point of getting these sorts of commitments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing I see&mdash;just a small thing&mdash;is that we are going to limit the number of birds taken out as family pets to two. I am not sure from the bill whether it is two per person or two per family. If it is two per family it is pretty absurd. Also, what sort of bird is this about? If it is a galah, a green budgerigar or a cockatiel, they are in such large numbers in Australia that it presents no threat whatsoever. I remember making a speech in this parliament, probably 15 years ago, which just shows how little things change. I recall seeing on the Nullarbor, shortly after we had actually banned the export of live fauna, 20,000-gallon tanks full of drowned budgerigars&mdash;20,000 gallons of stinking budgerigar soup. It is absurd to think there can be any threat to budgerigars by allowing their export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens to a family? They might have three children. They have got a pet bird each. What do you do? Do you have one bird put down, along with the child? It is quite silly and to have it in that form, where the limit is two, is quite absurd. There should be some ability to apply commonsense. I know legislators do not apply commonsense because we see in the bill here that under one offence&mdash;I tried to find it this morning while I was doing a radio interview; as you get older you are not so good at mental dexterity&mdash;we are going to apply to illegally importing or exporting fauna 10,000 penalty points, which equates to 10 years in gaol. I think that was the figure. Where is the logic in this? You can kill people and get less than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that, in the minds of many people, birds are people too. But I think we do have to have some rationality in this. I am concerned that this bill, like the fisheries acts in the states, particularly in Western Australia, gives to fauna investigators powers of search which seem to exceed the powers of the police. We have seen in Western Australia grave concern about the abuse of these powers by the fisheries department&mdash;at, I might add, the behest of the police. We should be looking at that and writing into the legislation some discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, if the family has a fetish for green budgerigars or galahs it does not matter how many they export, how many they take out of the country. Some people would say the more the better. The situation is that, while we have these draconian penalties for exporting fauna, we are at the same time poisoning those same birds. You can get a permit to do this and it happens around some of the irrigation areas. In reality, are we concerned about the illegal export of birds, or are we concerned about looking good in the eyes of the world and meeting our CITES obligations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no doubt that when there was a controlled export of fauna from Australia&mdash;that was prior to 1 June 1960&mdash;those people that had permits to be out in the field trapping birds took the business very seriously. If they found people out there trapping birds illegally, they would report them and they would be on the spot. It was very well policed and there was great control on it. Now the legal trappers are illegal so they are not out there. The illegal trappers are out there because they do not mind being illegal, and the birds are exported with great cruelty and they can accept enormous loss of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember that, for instance, in 1959 the company I worked for got an order from Germany for 15 tiger snakes. Wages at the time were about #6 10s a week and the company was paying me #5 a tiger snake&mdash;just money for old rope! I could go down to the south-east of South Australia and I could get that number of tiger snakes in a weekend. I do not believe I did the fauna of Australia any lasting harm by exporting those. There are still plenty of tiger snakes there. But it became a very serious crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to have some balance in the legislation, because  if we are going to apply these rules rigorously to animals that are not rare it is going to call into disrepute the whole system. Some birds should be protected. Some birds are rare. I would certainly object to the export of any night parrots, if we could find any. Even Bourke parrots are relatively rare, although I have seen them in large numbers. But other birds are simply readily available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this legislation, we are not going to allow the export of any animal unless it can be readily bred in captivity. That seems to me to be commercially rather stupid. Australia does have some unique birds which have a market in the world, and their uniqueness puts a substantial price on them. If we were to have a controlled market of these birds&mdash;and, I would suggest, in many cases it would simply allow for the export of birds bred in captivity&mdash;we would have a market such that if we applied a royalty to the sales at 100 per cent of the sale cost we would get a considerable sum, in the region of $30 million or $40 million a year, for the government, which could be earmarked for national parks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality with national parks is that, by and large, we mark them on maps and do nothing about them at all. There is no management applied at all. People who live next to them get the consequences. One cannot do anything about controlling vermin in these national parks, so the problem resides with the people who have properties adjoining them. It is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw in Broome that we had a world-class zoo&mdash;set up by Lord McAlpine&mdash;that could not possibly ever replace its capital value. However, if that zoo had been allowed to sell birds that were bred in captivity, it would have been viable and we would have kept a very valuable asset for the community there. How, in anybody's name&mdash;I was going to invoke God&mdash;does it deplete the fauna, or put fauna at risk, to export aviary bred birds?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To export from Australia an exotic bird&mdash;exotic in the view of the rest of the world&mdash;that is hard to breed is commercially very sensible, because it means that there is going to be an ongoing market for those birds. The reason that the price of these birds is very high overseas is that export is illegal. It is often done with great cruelty. If we were to allow the export of these birds on a controlled basis, the price would fall, but it would still be very viable. When we had wheat farmers going broke, if they could have got permits for a few hundred galahs or white cockatiels&mdash;which are in plague proportions&mdash;it would have made them viable. It would have saved them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, what has happened in Australia with a lot of these parrot types is that we have cut down their habitat. We have cleared it for wheat farming. The remaining trees get attacked by the birds. The strategy of the bird is to ringbark around its hole, so that it becomes very hard and the goanna cannot get its claws in. The goanna is one of the main predators. He cannot get a foothold there. It does not seem to worry cats much, but that is the bird's natural defence mechanism. When there are a lot of birds nesting in a tree they effectively end up ringbarking the tree, because they all make holes around their own little nests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, we have exponentially expanded the food supply. We planted the wheat for them. They have had a massive increase in food and a reduction in living accommodation. We have seen a big increase in numbers of these birds. I do not think there is any doubt that, in many areas, numbers of these birds have increased over time&mdash;just as, I might add, numbers of kangaroos have increased over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first went to the Nullarbor in 1960, there were no kangaroos on the Nullarbor. Here you had millions of acres of rolling grass plain, ideal kangaroo country. Why were there no kangaroos? For the same reason there were never any Aboriginals out there&mdash;there was no surface water. They could not exist without water. In a good season you would get a few reds come through. We put bores down, and within four years of our putting the water out there you could shoot 100 kangaroos a night. Now you will find the Nullarbor is home to kangaroos, both the red, Megaleia rufa, and the western grey, Macropus fuliginosus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the stupidity of it. Just as the fact that there were no Aboriginals out there will not stop native title claims, the fact that the kangaroo is in abundance will not stop the emotional nonsense you get in cities, where people say, `We don't see any kangaroos now.' Of course they do not; the kangaroos have been built out. But there is absolutely no doubt that the number of kangaroos in Australia is greater today than it has been at any time in Australia's history. The emotional nonsense that goes on in this trade is quite bizarre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have, in kangaroo, the finest and strongest leather, by weight, in the world&mdash;the ideal leather for orthopaedic shoes. Australia should be the world's capital in the construction of orthopaedic shoes. But then, I suppose you must get realistic and realise that orthopaedic shoes would only benefit human beings. We seem to be, in present-day thinking, fairly low on the scale of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do support the bill. It has amended some silly provisions. It has made things better but there are a couple of points that should be looked at. I also think that, as a nation, we should be looking at what is good for the fauna, what is good for the country, what is good in our own national interest, and looking at relaxing the export of some of these species on a commercial basis. I do not mind if that money is earmarked for national parks. We put these national parks on the maps because it makes the people in Sydney and Melbourne feel good, but in reality very little is done with them. In Western Australia, for instance, we have the massive Rudall River National Park. Why is it there? Back in the 1960s there was a bit of pressure in Perth on Sir Charles Court and he said, `I'll give `em conservation. I'll give `em a national park.' It was a national park half the size of Tasmania, in the middle of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody had a look at it, nobody did any mineralogy. In fact, it was put over mining leases where companies had actually gone out with mining leases granted by the government and had discovered uranium, in this case, at Rudall River. We then had to make a very hurried correction and make the national park bind around their leases. </PARA>

The amendments will enhance the extent to which Australia discharges its responsibilities under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and the Convention on Biological Diversity.

Those members will be comforted to know that the government is actively addressing these matters. Fish product importation issues are now being considered on a broader front by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins).

The government recognises that trade in plants is of significance as the worldwide movement of plants over the last two centuries has allowed the introduction of large numbers of environmental weeds.

<PARA>This bill amends the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 to give effect to initiatives announced in the 1995-96 budget and to provide for cost supplementation of grants for 1995 and 1996 in accordance with established policy. The bill proposes an extension of the early literacy program to 1996. This program provides grants to foster literacy development for children in the early years of schooling. Some $6.666 million is to be made available to government schools and $2.208 million to non-government schools in the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As in 1995, there will be special emphasis on children disadvantaged by low socioeconomic circumstances. Another budget initiative reflected in the bill is a proposal for a new program of grants to non-government special schools to assist students with disabilities to make the transition to mainstream school education or to pursue further training or employment. An amount of $3.22 million is to be provided in 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final budget decision reflected in the bill is the cessation of new projects in 1996 under the gender equity program and the gifted and talented children program, and of staff training, development and community liaison under the hostels for rural school students program. These initiatives have either served their purpose or are now more appropriately the responsibility of other bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for supplementation of capital and recurrent grants to reflect movements in costs. For 1995, this means an additional $7 million for capital purposes and $55 million for recurrent programs and, for 1996, an additional $56 million for recurrent programs and a further $7 million for capital programs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I discuss the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995, Deputy Speaker Andrew, I will again place on the public record my objection to a bill talking about educating young Australians being presented in the Main Committee. This is not meant with any disrespect to you, Sir. The bill that I heard debated prior to this was the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill, and it is an utter disgrace that this debate is not being held in the main chamber. As I have said before, it is also an utter disgrace that this House rises at 8 o'clock. If that is the reason we are in this Main Committee, then heaven help democracy in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view is that there are very many people who come into this House and who go into the main chamber to hear matters that they want to hear discussed, or else they are here on a visit to see what the business of the House is; yet we are here, stuck in this appalling little room, discussing matters of great importance to all of us and, indeed, denying a large number of people the opportunity to hear the business of this House. It is an utter disgrace. I am not blaming the government: there was a bipartisan approach to this. I have said all the way along that it was ill-informed decision by all those involved, and I again place that on the public record. Having said that, I will not pursue it any further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives me great pleasure to speak on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1995. This bill gives effect to a number of measures announced in the 1995-96 budget. As a result, no new grants will be provided in 1996 to the program to improve the learning experience of girls, nor to special projects in connection with non-government rural school student hostels, nor to the program to assist gifted and talented children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, however, does provide an extension of the early literacy program to 1996, as well as establishing a new program of grants for projects of non-government special schools to assist students with disabilities to make the transition to mainstream school education or to pursue further training or employment. Of course, other measures were announced by Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) during his speech, but I will not take up the time of the House to repeat them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill in many ways is a blueprint of the government's plans for school funding in the future. Although the coalition will not be opposing this bill, we do have real concerns about the direction in which the government is preparing to take school funding. There are some measures in the legislation which the coalition welcomes, but we are concerned about the timing of the announcement. Those measures include the additional $8.9 million to extend the early literacy program, and the additional $3.2 million for the commencement of the transition support for special schools to assist students with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few comments on students with disabilities. Let there be no doubt that the coalition is committed to ensuring improved access to education for students with disabilities. Students with disabilities have as much right as able-bodied students to a first-class education. These students and their parents do not want pity or platitudes. What they want is a genuine commitment by governments to ensure access to a quality education. That is why this long overdue announcement by the government is welcomed by the opposition. The issue of funding for transitional support for disabled students has long been an issue and I have been informed by many, in both the government and the non-government school sector, that they have long lobbied the government for funding. Although this is a welcome measure, we must question the motives of a government which announces such an issue in the budget prior to an election. This is typical of Labor in campaign mode and one can only question its genuine commitment to disabled students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's long overdue initiatives on literacy are also welcomed. However, this government has been there for over 12 years and we can rightly question its ability and its commitment to deliver proper literacy standards. I have documented in the past all the so-called initiatives that we have had over the last 12 years of Labor. I will not take up the time of the chamber and repeat the details, except to say that in October 1995 we had a minister who, when asked about the state of literacy in Australia, replied that he did not know. He did not know that 25 per cent of Australian children in Australian schools are battling literacy problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would ask the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training what his literacy survey is showing, and when he will be tabling the results for us to see. If the minister wishes to be taken seriously in this debate, then I challenge him to table the results of the literacy survey before the next election even if they are only interim results. If he has the courage of his convictions that the literacy levels in this country are at respectable standards, then this should not be a cause for embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that I am not the only one who has grave concerns about the current state of Australia's literacy levels. One of Australia's leading authors, Mem Fox, has described the level of literacy amongst Australian schoolchildren as `not up to scratch'. Not only is she an author, but Mem Fox is an associate professor of teacher education at Flinders University and is a well-known exponent of what has become known as the whole language learning approach to literacy. There is no doubt that Mem Fox is a highly respected member of the community and an informed voice in the education arena. Her views should be taken seriously, especially when she warns that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . children must have literacy basics in order to be able to function as literate members of our society, and these must be explicitly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat `explicitly'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">taught over and over again.</PARA>
<PARA>What Mem Fox is actually saying is that in 1995 Australian schoolchildren are not being taught the basics of English&mdash;reading and writing. What sort of a society have we become where the basics in reading and writing have been overlooked to the extent that we need to have them as a national focus again?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are parents, teachers, authors and academics expressing concerns about the declining literacy standards in Australia but so, I might say begrudgingly, is the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. In a speech to the House on 9 March this year, the minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would be the first to admit that the work we have done in literacy has not been completely successful.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an admission of defeat on the part of the minister. If this has been the result of so-called initiatives in the past, what hope can we have that present initiatives, such as the early literacy program, will be a success? What guarantee can the minister give us that in 12 months time we will not be here again being told that the past programs in literacy have not been a complete success?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, what is needed is a national strategy to raise standards of literacy and numeracy along the lines of those being developed by many of the states. Such a strategy will allow better identification of those students who are in need, and a better direction and focus of resources for those students. It is important that these resources are targeted to the acquisition of literacy competencies in the early years of schooling, for this, in many ways, is a prerequisite for later success in education and, indeed, in life generally. A recent report by the Schools Council entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Resources and accountability: Commonwealth funding scenarios for government primary schools 1996-2000</EMPHASIS> also has some very interesting points to make about literacy. The report found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is widely acknowledged that people lacking effective English literacy are likely to be severely disadvantaged in terms of employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA>It is simply not good enough for the minister to concede on the literacy front when the consequences are so high for many young Australians. If a low level of literacy is detrimental to a student's future, why has it taken Labor 12 years to act?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My friend and colleague the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) is in the chamber today. We have been actively involved in a parliamentary inquiry into truancy. As the report has not been released, I will be mindful of what I say. But I am sure that he would agree with me that the issues of literacy and the consequences for illiterate children have been raised with us right across Australia. They are matters of deep concern to both of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Literacy is not the only area where the government has let down the students of Australia. Rural education has long been an area of neglect by this Labor government. Nowhere is neglect more evident than in the proposal to end certain aspects of the rural hostels program. This program provided an important opportunity for access to education for many country students. The objects of the program were to increase access to schools for students from isolated rural areas by improving the effectiveness of the operation of hostels for rural students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recurrent funding in this program was used for staff training and development, management advice, frameworks for information exchange, office equipment, recruitment of staff and promotion and support services for students. The government was very proud of this program. On page 21 of its education and training policy for the 1993 federal election it boasted that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Labor Government will provide recurrent funding of over $3.5 million over the next three years to support existing and developing hostels for rural school students.</PARA>
<PARA>But this was not just an idle commitment. The 1994-95  Department of Employment Education and Training `Programs Book', at page 19, refers quite explicitly to funding for the rural hostels program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in 1994, the allocation for this program is $1.6m. A further $1 million will be provided each year in 1995 and 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>This is funding that the non-government rural hostels have budgeted for; they made plans based on that funding. Now, with this legislation, we find this is not the case. The bill will not allocate the promised $1 million to that sector. The legislation is a clear breach of promise by the government, and exposes just how deceitful it was towards the rural sector at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been advised that many of these hostels will now have to look for alternative sources of funding, with many unaware of where this funding will come from. I understand that this decision was made with no warning, no consultation and no respect for those in the rural sector. The government has well and truly left the rural hostels in the lurch by promising $3 million, yet delivering only $2 million. One million dollars may not seem a lot to the minister, but it makes a hell of a difference to those in the rural sector who are already struggling to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What makes this decision all the more heartless is that is has been done at a time of high levels of rural unemployment, and at the time of one of the worst droughts in Australia's history. The minister is simply not aware of the hardships and the struggles that rural Australia is going through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On July 6 this year the minister actually came to my electorate talking of the need for an educational vision for rural Australia. Attending a conference of the Society for the Provision of Education in Rural Australia Inc, the minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rural families are often concerned about educational opportunities for their children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet he is quite happy to rip away at the programs that aim to provide these opportunities. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), recently allocated three-quarters of a million dollars to student unions in Victorian universities so that they can print articles about shoplifting. Yet he is not prepared to fund education so that all Australian children are guaranteed access to education. Was the money that was used to fund articles encouraging students to shoplift torn away from the rural hostels program?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of allocation of resources should be of concern to many in the school sector. It was recently made clear by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training that the government, in the unfortunate event that it is re-elected, intends to further centralise the funding of schools. In one of his many notorious forays into the portfolio responsibilities of Minister Free, Minister Crean stated on July 18 this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It makes me wonder if untying grants is the right way to go.</PARA>
<PARA>Simply, this is code for increasing the power of Canberra over Australian education. If the government is allowed to go along this path it will destroy the flexibility that schools and states currently enjoy in funding allocation. It will mean that decisions will be made by Canberra bureaucrats, as opposed to those within the school community who are directly affected by the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, for all his comments about state education, the opposition leader in Victoria is apparently very keen to ensure that schools at the grassroots level maintain the flexibility that they have at the moment. One can only assume that he would be vehemently opposed to the move that Minister Crean seems hell-bent on implementing. In short, this approach will mean that schools will be Canberra managed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like it or not, we live in a federation where education is the primary responsibility of the states. The government has now signalled its intention to stop untied grants without providing any reasonable rationale for doing so. I will be interested to hear the views of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training on this issue. Was his senior minister expressing his own opinion, the government's opinion, or Minister Free's opinion? Whose opinion was Minister Crean expressing when, for example, he accused the Victorian government of siphoning federal education funding into `casinos and racetracks'? This totally unsubstantiated comment was a gross abuse of ministerial responsibility, and by his silence the minister for schools is equally implicated in this outlandish claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing in relation to the federal government's position vis-a-vis funding for the states is utter confusion caused by too many people interfering in areas for which they are not directly responsible. Minister Crean has threatened to scrap $16 million in extra school funding next year if Victoria does not join national literacy and education outcomes programs. But this view is entirely inconsistent with the praise lavished on the Victorian government's literacy initiatives by the minister for schools in the House on 23 August when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is delighted that a Liberal state government has seen the merits of what the Commonwealth has been trying to achieve in the field of literacy.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister Free went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should add that I am happy the Victorian statement contains an emphasis on the reporting of outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>If Minister Crean makes good in his threat to cut this funding, where does this leave Minister Free or, more importantly, the people of Victoria? And which state will be next on Minister Crean's political hit list?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that Minister Crean constantly takes over the responsibilities of Minister Free. He gets into areas where he is not welcome and I am sure it is a cause of embarrassment for Minister Free, because he uses political opportunism to sink his boots into the states. If he has legitimate complaints about the states, fair enough. But when it is just political and when he is overriding the responsibility of his ministerial colleague, my view is that he should butt out of it and leave it to the person who has the responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Attention also needs to be drawn to the fact that the government no longer feels that gifted and talented children are worthy of federal funding. These children deserve support and recognition of their talents, and a commitment by the government to nurture these abilities. This government's failure to do this is a very telling reflection on it and how it sees Australia in the future. We will not be a clever country if we neglect students in this group. By abolishing funding to these students the government is in fact punishing them for accelerating and achieving to a very high standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proper education policy has been railroaded by a Treasury and Finance edict which has being handed to the minister and with which he must comply. This legislation reveals just what the ALP intends to do in the unlikely event that it is returned to government. These cuts are just the first stage of the government's agenda to reduce funding for education. This is what was shown in the budget leaks, this is what is shown in this legislation, and this is what will be evident after the election if Labor is returned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says it is proud of its record on schooling. Yet it has devoted a mere handful of pages in its Shaping the Nation document&mdash;better known as `Shafting the Nation'&mdash;to substantiating its so-called achievements in this area. As we debate what will possibly be the last bill of this parliament which allocates funding to schools, I believe that it is appropriate to look at some of what the government claims has been achieved through legislation such as this, and what the actual outcomes have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claims to have brought in `vocational education reforms which concentrate on matching industry needs'&mdash;that is a quote from `Shafting the Nation'. Yet many reports, such as the Karpin report, the CEDA report and the FitzGerald report, all reveal that vocational education and training is irrelevant to the needs of many businesses and industry. Training is not providing the links with these sectors that was promised in Working Nation. As a result, we are seeing appalling low levels of trainees and apprentices to the extent where, as a proportion of the labour force, the number of apprentices and trainees is now at its lowest point in a quarter of a century. The report by CEDA further reveals that Australia has one of the lowest rates of participation in secondary level vocational education in the OECD. This is not the sign of a successful vocational education training system, nor is it an achievement a government should be proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of retention rates, the government claims in `Shafting the Nation' that under Labor they have `improved dramatically'. The latest retention rate figures from the ABS show a retention rate of 74.6 per cent for 1994&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Shaping the Nation report&mdash;which, as Mr Deputy Speaker quite rightly indicates, I have referred to as `Shafting the Nation'&mdash;said that under Labor they had `improved dramatically'. The latest retention rate figures from the ABS show a retention rate of 74.6 per cent for 1994, which follows the downward pattern since the peak of 77.1 per cent in 1992.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Member for Ballarat criticises the Federal Government because retention rates were down in the past year. But it is the States which have the responsibility for running schools.</PARA>
<PARA>Thus, as retention rates decrease, the federal government becomes less keen to be associated with them. When they were up, to use an expression which I think is one that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) uses&mdash;I do not know whether it is one of his or he has borrowed it&mdash;the government was absolutely `rusted' onto retention rates. Indeed, the government was claiming all the credit for it. Shaping the Nation&mdash;`Shafting the Nation'&mdash;indeed speaks in glowing terms about the federal government's involvement. But, as soon as the WD40 comes on, it is rusted off and the numbers start dropping, all of a sudden it becomes the responsibility of the states.

It would appear that, as far as the Labor government is concerned, teachers do not play an important part in Shaping the Nation. This failure is even more surprising when we see the outcome of a survey conducted by the Australian Teaching Council, where it was found that teachers often feel the community holds them in low regard and does not understand the nature of their work. If our teachers do not feel confident themselves, or do not feel confident they have the support of the community, how can we expect them to feel confident about the job they are doing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next election will be a very important one for the school community throughout Australia. This legislation shows the cuts Labor has in store and the way it is prepared to treat with neglect those who do not live in the capital cities and those who have talents which need to be nurtured. It also shows the highly centralised structure that the government wishes to impose on school funding if given a chance. This is clearly what the Labor Party offers schools post the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the way the coalition views education.

What this legislation has shown is that, after 12 1/2 years, Labor has been able to offer little in the area of education. As both ministers squabble over who has portfolio responsibility for what, many in the school sector have began to ignore them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, this bill makes provision to assist students with disabilities to make the transition to mainstream school education or to pursue further training and employment. These two provisions are designed to enhance opportunities for students who might otherwise be denied fair access and equal opportunity. This is affirmative action as it should be, focusing on the young, the poor and the disabled, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or religion. The bill illustrates important philosophical differences between Labor and the conservatives. For example, Labor believes government has a role to play in bringing about equality of opportunity. The conservatives believe government has no such role to play. The Kennett, Brown and Court Liberal governments in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia are perfect examples of the non-role conservative governments wish to play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This conservative view of a limited role for government has as its underlying assumption the notion that disadvantage is the fault of those who are disadvantaged and that therefore disadvantage is something which the individual must overcome, with the help, perhaps, of charities. But a role for government in bringing about equality of access and opportunity is not something the conservative mind will concede. One of the reasons why the conservatives have been out of office for so long is that the conservative view is not consistent with the Australian idea of a fair go for all. However, it does appear that the conservatives have woken up to the fact that Australians reject their dog eat dog vision of the future for this country. Remember Fightback? What is their response?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will get onto lies in a minute. They simply refuse to tell the electorate what their policies are. The honourable member for Ballarat in his 30 minutes did not mention one policy. Not one. Just Like Mr Kennett, Mr Court and Mr Brown before him, the Federal Liberal leader, Mr Howard, refuses to tell the Australian people what his party would do should they win government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irony in all of this is that, while it is an act of secretiveness, an attempt to deceive, it is also very revealing. Consider this. If you have policies of which you are proud, which you are prepared to stand up for and to be judged on&mdash;education policies or whatever&mdash;what reason could there be for withholding them from the electorate?  Of course, there is only one reason and it has two parts. Firstly, they know their policies will not stand up to scrutiny. Secondly, they know that they will be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On these counts, they are probably correct. Once freed of the rhetoric and properly analysed, the electorate will reject their policies. It is as simple as that. They will reject them because one of the things that the Australian people insist on is fairness and equality of opportunity&mdash;a fair go for everybody. These are the very characteristics which Liberal policies will not contain. As a rule, their policies are demonstration of a mean-spiritedness, and are hardest on those who most need assistance&mdash;the young, the poor, the disabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For proof of this, look at the performance of any of the Liberal state governments: there are common threads running through them all. One common thread is that they have been prepared deliberately to deceive the electorate in order to get elected. All of them refused to release their policies in time for adequate public scrutiny in the lead-up to the polls at which they were elected. Others told outright untruths. For example, the South Australian Premier, Mr Brown, promised more money for education. The fact is that, by l996, he will have chopped $100 million off the education budget. I think Mr Kennett has chopped $400 million off the education budget. Premier Brown in South Australia has removed more than 1,600 teachers and support staff from the schools. There can be no contest on this. Mr Brown and his then shadow minister, Mr Lucas, told untruths to the South Australian public in order to get elected. The proof is in the pudding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another common thread is the one that runs through the personal characteristics of Liberal leaders. It is that they display an antagonism, a resentment, towards ordinary working people. Why this is so would be a very interesting thesis for a psychology doctorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Phillip Adams, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>, put the problems of the Liberal leadership down to poor potty training. He describes Mr Howard as not merely conservative, but reactionary. He says that Howard is a cloud of pessimism, an albatross around the electorate's neck, a harbinger of doom, who seems weighed down with bitterness and self-pity. Phillip Adams says that, when he thinks of Mr Howard, the initials `PM' mean `post-mortem' rather than `Prime Minister'. He says that the man was born to be a mortician, if not a corpse. What seethes in Howard, he writes, is resentment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This resentment, this bitterness and antagonism towards the working people of this country, is a trait Mr Howard shares with the Liberal state premiers. It would not be harmful except for the fact that their policies reflect this peculiar bitterness and resentment. For example, the Court government is enacting industrial relations legislation which appears to be specifically designed to cause hardship and industrial disruption. Of course, the teachers in Western Australia are very angry at the Court government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Administrators who wish to achieve results in the public service for the common good of all parties, and for the country generally, would not take such a confrontationist course of action. Labor governments have followed sensible, cooperative industrial relations policies, which have seen great improvement in productivity and flexibility while, at the same time, markedly reducing the incidence of time and money wasting disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is sensible administration. Despite it being sensible, the productive way, Liberal leaders refuse to take that path. They appear to want to credential themselves with achieving industrial unrest and they do not seem to care who it involves, whether it is our schools or our teachers. It does not matter. It is an attack on ordinary working men and women. It is very odd behaviour. It is not only in industrial relations. The Court government's approach to Mabo and its refusal to correct the disgraceful electoral gerrymander in that state also reveal its contempt for matters of justice and for the very tenets of our democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other Liberal governments have similar report cards. They have all striven to stifle equality of opportunity, to stir up workplace confrontation, to deny democratic rights and to silence opponents by threats, untruths and any other means possible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is his report card. He told untruths to the electorate about expanding education funding. He attempted to deceive the electorate and the parliament over the Catch Tim and Moriki affairs regarding secret donations to the Liberal Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I repeat, in the lead-up to the 1993 election in South Australia the Liberals promised that spending on education would increase. That is what they promised. By 1996 they will have cut $100 million out of the budget. It is important to know what people in South Australia and in other areas think of this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a finding in the court, Justice Olsen cast severe doubts on the credibility of the Premier's testimony as a witness in the court. He said that he unhesitatingly preferred the evidence given by Mr Blaikie, the CEO of the health department, to that given by Premier Brown. Justice Olsen said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am also of the impression that some aspects of his&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Premier Brown's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">evidence may have been influenced by a degree of ex post facto reasoning.</PARA>
<PARA>The obvious interpretation of that is that Mr Brown has been caught telling untruths in court. That is his behavioural report card. This is the person who is going to be responsible for our young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story is no better on policy. The promise was made during the 1993 election in South Australia that they would expand expenditure on education. That was an untruth. The facts prove it was an untruth. It was part of a deliberate strategy to gain office at any cost&mdash;in particular, at the cost of the truth. It reveals their contempt for the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are these: the education budget has already been cut by $40 million, with another $60 million to come; class sizes have been increased; and, at the latest count, more than 1,600 teachers and support staff have gone. The latest decision, to cut the equivalent of 250 full-time school service officers, will hit the schools in the lower socioeconomic areas hardest. This has been a pattern of the Brown government's administration&mdash;and not only in education. School service officers are commonly part-time, low income positions, but they do provide a very important service to students in a range of areas and help encourage students complete their schooling. The cuts apply to the number of staff, not to the work they are expected to perform. This will mean more stress for the remaining support staff and for teachers. In the end, it is the children's education which will suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One notorious Liberal member in South Australia, Mr Joe Rossi, the member for Lee, suggested to his community&mdash;also my community&mdash;that parents could quite easily take the place of school officers at no cost whatsoever. Good one, Joe! That was almost as good as his suggestion to sterilise single mothers and blame the employees at the Garibaldi factory for the tragic poisoning situation that occurred there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The education cuts are another demonstration of the different priorities between the Liberal and Labor parties. South Australia has lost the position it gained under Labor of being internationally recognised as a leader in education. It is now going backwards. Our retention rates, once the best in the country at 93 per cent, have now crashed to 76 per cent. If you are going to take $100 million out of the money that is going to be spent on schools, of course it is going to have some deleterious effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students who complete year 12 have a marked advantage in developing to their full potential through further full-time education or employment based development. It should be a matter of grave concern to a minister of education that one in four of our students disappears from the system. Four thousand have disappeared so far this year in South Australia. But how does the minister, Mr Lucas, respond to this? Is he concerned about what is happening to the students who are disappearing from the education system? Is he taking any action to reverse the decline? Is he doing something about TAFE? The answer is that he is not. His only response is simply to gloat about the savings that the decline in retention rates brings. It is a disgraceful response from an education minister, but it is very consistent with the conservative philosophy that apportions blame to those who suffer disadvantage and denies a role for government in providing assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) said recently, very revealingly, that there was no role for government in picking up the pieces of a family breakup. Some commentators have dismissed this as an aberration. But the point is that it is not an aberration; it is mainstream Liberal thinking on the role of government. The proof of that is in the pudding of the policies they enact when in government. It also demonstrates the failure of the Liberal government to recognise trends in the labour market and to response appropriately to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Full-time jobs for youths aged 15 to 19 have been declining for the last couple of decades as the economy modernises and gains an international focus. The role for government in these changing times is to assist students to gain the qualifications they need to enter the work force, but the Liberals see no role for government here. Their response is simply to gloat about the savings made when people fall through the system and lose opportunity, and in the end that will be more costly, both in personal terms and in terms of the national economy. It is our greatest asset. That is a cliche, I know, that is used far too often, but it is true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only the school education system. For the people who are being removed from the school system, what the government is doing in TAFE in South Australia is nothing short of a tragedy. Labor had made TAFE industry-driven, but still responsive to the needs of the whole community, and with the strongest commitment to access and equity, to equal opportunity. With the federal government, the previous state Labor government funded training places for thousands more young people to enable TAFE to respond even better to the training requirements of industry. All that is now sadly in jeopardy in South Australia. It is the only state in the Commonwealth yet to meet the criteria for Commonwealth growth funds to flow. In a typically short-sighted move the Brown government has cut funding to TAFE by $5 million in dollar terms&mdash;but by much more in real terms, of course. Our TAFE system's institutions are being bled dry and it is the provision of a skilled work force that is being compromised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, in providing for early literacy programs, especially for those disadvantaged by low socioeconomic circumstances, and in providing for improved access and equity for people with disabilities, demonstrates as well as any bill can the difference between the priorities of the government and the conservative opposition. The Liberals do not have any commitment to the principles of equal access and equal opportunity and they fail to grasp the critical link between a strong education and training system and the building of a modern efficient economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the federal Labor government's record is proven. Labor has created a decade of expansion of education opportunity at all levels. It has increased opportunity for individuals. It has lifted our economic performance. And it has provided the skills and flexibility needed in our emerging and modern economy. When the opposition was last in government, seven out of 10 young Australians left the education system without completing high school. Most of those people are in the labour market today&mdash;many of them unemployed due to that criminal neglect. Now, the opposition's colleagues in state governments are repeating the same policies. They are quashing opportunity, rather than enhancing opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should the opposition win government at the next federal poll, they would make the same savage cuts their counterparts in the states have made. They would contract opportunity, rather than expand it. They would turn students out of the education and training system, rather than fund their futures. I believe the people of South Australia, the people in my electorate of Port Adelaide, and all Australians deserve much better, and I commend this bill to the house. </PARA>

I want to dwell on one particular aspect of this bill&mdash;the cessation of the $1.1 million rural hostels program. While this would appear to be a paltry sum, the number of people living outside of the major towns and cities in Australia that have secondary school education available to them is probably in excess of half a million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), made a great issue of social justice and spoke about social injustice. There can be no greater social injustice than the deprivation of a secondary school education. It is an injustice to deprive a person of an ability to gain a job. Almost 80 per cent of jobs in society today have secondary education as a prerequisite. If you have not got it, 80 per cent of the jobs in society today are not available to you. Your ability to go into business for yourself is seriously curtailed by a lack of a secondary education. In fact, it could be said that without a secondary education you are an economic pariah and&mdash;I venture to suggest&mdash;possibly a social pariah as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the seven major electorates in Australia&mdash;Northern Territory, Kalgoorlie, South Australia, which is almost one electorate, my own electorate of Kennedy as well as Leichhardt and Maranoa in Queensland, and Parkes in New South Wales&mdash;they take up 82 per cent of the surface area of Australia. And if I shave off the edges of my own electorate and Leichhardt&mdash;the coastal belt that is about 40 kilometres wide&mdash;those electorates contain 3 1/2 per cent of the Australian population. But let us just use a rough figure of half a million people living in those electorates, or that 82 per cent of the surface area of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there are towns that are big enough to have secondary school education, such as Mount Isa and Longreach, to name two in my own electorate, there is a very significant proportion of those people&mdash;some 20,000 or 30,000 in the electorate of Kennedy&mdash;who have no access to secondary school education whatsoever. If there are 10 situations like that throughout Australia&mdash;and it is a lot worse in some of the other electorates, I might say, than in my own&mdash;there are, on that basis, some 200,000 Australians who are being deprived of a secondary education. That used not to be the situation, and I think there is a modicum of hypocrisy with people who come into this house and talk about social justice. There is social justice for those people living in big towns and cities but, for those people living in small towns, there is no social justice whatsoever. They have no ability to secure for themselves a secondary school education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation has changed dramatically since 1986 in Queensland. If you turn the clock back, the cost of going away to a boarding school was about $6,600&mdash;if my memory serves me correctly&mdash;and the entire cost of going away was picked up by the state and federal governments. The incoming socialist state government in Queensland effectively removed what was called the remote area scholarship, which was a straight $2,000 in the hand, on top of the other assistance that was and still is available. In the meantime, of course, as far as schools are concerned, the cost of sending a child away to school has risen from about $6,500 a year to about $8,500 a year. I am not talking here about elitist GPS schools; I am talking about church schools in North Queensland that were built for the specific purpose of providing a secondary school education to kids who would otherwise not have had such an education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the remote area scholarship was removed, the federal government made a token effort to overcome the problem by instituting a system that we are removing here today: the system of country hostels. They said, `At least you can go to Mount Isa or to Longreach, because there is a hostel there and you can get your secondary school education there, and that will be cheaper than the church-run boarding schools.' But, quite frankly, it has not worked out to be as cheap as the church-run boarding schools. It has possibly worked out to be more expensive, but there is one great advantage: the kids can be brought home at weekends. For people close in, that was a very significant advantage of the hostels, because the kids could go home of a weekend, and the parents did not have to pay for having the child looked after of a weekend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, the modicum of effort that was made to overcome this terribly oppressive and tyrannical injustice is being removed. I simply do not know why there would be, in a period of great trauma for rural Australia, such a nasty, vicious attempt to remove what little access rural people had to secondary school education. Let me say to those people who are doing this today that England did the same thing to Ireland, which was for some 200 years deprived of an education. It was almost impossible to get an education if you were Irish. Of course, 200 years later, England is still harvesting the seeds of hatred that it sowed during that period of time. Today, those same seeds of hatred are being sown in country Australia&mdash;seeds that will be carried by people for the rest of their days and by future generations of people who do not live in the big cities of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, I submitted to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters a submission concerning, effectively, the situation in country areas in Australia. Under the heading, `Tyranny of the majority', I referred to some remarks which are very pertinent to the debate today, words written by Alexis de Tocqueville in 1835, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">De la Democratie en Amerique</EMPHASIS>. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Democracy should not be allowed to become a mechanism by which the majority can oppress the minority. Safe guards to protect basic rights&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concept of a tax being arbitrarily imposed upon a people without those being taxed having any real say in the levying and expenditure of such moneys is a concept repugnant to all people who believe in Freedom.</PARA>
<PARA>In Julia Creek and Richmond, we are paying the same taxes as people pay in Brisbane but we have no right or access to a secondary school education&mdash;none! And I am not even talking about a tertiary education: this is simply secondary education. In my submission, under the heading `Government for the good of all, not just the majority', I also quoted <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encyclopaedia Britannica</EMPHASIS> on Edmund Burke. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Burke supported . . . the widening of political participation . . . provided there was restraint of aggressive partiality . . . Burke rejected any doctrine of mere rule of numbers.</PARA>
<PARA>Burke was saying exactly the same thing as Alexis de Tocqueville and Thomas Jefferson. These people, who had sat down and thought about the way that the system worked, could clearly foresee the terrible oppression which was going to be meted out to minority groups in society today. This injustice is able to happen today because, in the Labor Party room, there are only two or three spokesmen for outback Australia. In the Coalition Party room, there are only two or three spokesmen for outback Australia. We have a policy in Australia of having the same number of people in every electorate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The viciousness of the system that has been imposed upon us says that, if you are dying out there, you have to have a hell of a lot more people in your electorate than if you are growing. We are dying because we have not even got any secondary education that we can provide for our kids. People are running away at a hundred miles an hour. Therefore, because we are dying, we have to have less representation than people in the cities have. I have 85,000 electors in my electorate, but most of the people sitting opposite have 72,000 in theirs. Some of them are down in the 60,000 range. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are exceptions and, most certainly, two of the exceptions are Kalgoorlie and the Northern Territory. But let me move on. I put my itineraries for the last month in that submission and they show that 43 hours a week was spent on travel. Someone was stupid enough to say, `Why don't you travel in an aeroplane?' I said, `I was waiting for that question.' Only one of those trips in the last four weeks was done in a motor car and the rest were done in an aeroplane. To get anywhere in the electorate that I represent, even in a light aircraft, means travelling three or four hours. It is worse still for the member of Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I cannot help but mention, in the context of this deprivation, the situation of people out there. The average Australian worker earns $644 a week and the taxation rate in Australia is 29 per cent, which is $215. When we take that off the $644 it leaves him with $429.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of living in the mid-west region of Queensland&mdash;which is my electorate&mdash;and the central west is 24 per cent higher than it is in Brisbane. It would be a lot worse in the Northern Territory, in the electorate of Kalgoorlie and in the north of South Australia. When we include that 24 per cent, or $132, that leaves him with $297 as his income. If he is married with one child, he is $50 a week below the poverty line. The average Australian living out there in that other Australia, which is 82 per cent of the surface area of the continent, lives $50 below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been very general in my remarks about the issue of deprivation but I now want to be very specific about it. I rang all of the big boarding schools in Charter Towers to ask about their fees. These are the schools that service northern Australia. They are all church schools and they are run very cheaply. They are not GPS schools; the figures for the GPS boarding schools in Brisbane would be twice these figures. For the Catholic schools there, the figure is $7,540. The Anglican school fees are $8,280 and the Uniting Church affiliated school fees are also $8,280. The fees for the Cathedral School, an Anglican school in Townsville, are $8,350. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average for those schools is $8,160, and I must emphasise that they are in the northern half of the state. If children have to go to school in the southern half of the state, and there are only GPS schools, elitist schools, the fees are almost twice what I am quoting here. I would advise people in the southern half of the state to go to school in the northern half of the state. On top of the school fees, and I now refer to an article in Tuesday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, there are additional costs to a total of $4,350. There are things in that list that parents of kids going to a state school in Sydney would like their children to have such as music tuition and private tuition, and they would probably like to be able to spend huge amounts of money on odds and ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have deducted all of those things and I have simply kept in the figures from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, which are taken from a study by the Australian Scholarships Group. The additional costs are listed as: stationery, $283 a year; text books, $269 a year; art and craft materials, $121 a year; clothing for boys, $378 a year, which I think is a bit high but those are the official figures of the study; sport and sporting equipment, $232; and outings and trips, $162. That comes to $1,485. For children going away to boarding school, there is another $500 on top of that. I think that is a fairly moderate figure for travel to and from school for the four terms of the year. With that $500 there that is $1,900 on top of the $8,000 for fees. So we have a figure close to $10,000, and for that you will get the princely sum from the state and federal governments of $4,600. In some enormously extenuating circumstances, it might be possible to get $5,000. I do not know of anyone who is getting $5,000. I think $4,600 is a fairly generous figure, as far as assistance people can get from the commonwealth and state governments, and that is the maximum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For each child there is a shortfall of $5,000 a year and this is for people who are lucky if they are earning an average weekly wage. Of course, rural workers are some of the most lowly paid people in society today. Probably the only people worse off are the farmers themselves, whose incomes are even lower. However, these people have to find, if they have got two kids, $10,000 a year, and when they are already $50 a week below the poverty line that would be a good trick for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it comes as no surprise that in remote areas&mdash;and all of the Northern Territory is a remote area with the exception of Darwin; Alice Springs and all of my electorate, except for the coast, are remote areas&mdash;55 per cent of kids complete grade 12, whereas in urban communities 73 per cent complete grade 12. Quite frankly, that 55 per cent is a 1991 figure and I guarantee that it will be a lot worse than that now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have a lot of people of Aboriginal descent who have special funding available to them, so they can at least get away to school. That 55 per cent would be accounted for to a very large degree by those who are of Aboriginal descent. Once I used to say that there would be some rich people too in that figure but there would be very few of those now. That figure also includes people who have contracts with their mining companies to provide education. Clearly, 50 per cent fewer people from rural Australia will complete grade 12 than in an urban situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also mention the tertiary level in remote areas. A map of Australia showing remote areas shows that that is almost the entire surface area of the continent. A higher education series update of 3 November 1992 reported that the participation rate in higher education among people from remote areas was less than half the participation rate of people from urban areas. Let me be more specific: 27.7 per cent of people from urban areas participate in tertiary education as against about 14 per cent in rural areas. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to rise to support the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. The bill amends the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act of 1992 and gives effect to several government initiatives announced in 1995-96 budget. It is part of this government's ongoing commitment to providing young Australians with a quality education that will expand their economic and social opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor governments in power have always attached a high priority to the funding of education in Australia. If we go back in recent history, we can note the enormous achievements of the Whitlam government in the funding of higher education and, of course, secondary and primary education in Australia. That very proud tradition has been carried on by the Hawke and Keating governments, and that commitment is reflected in the funds that are being allocated by this bill today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has always viewed education as a key to unlocking the potential of the people of this nation. Labor in government has always treated education as an investment, not simply as a cost to the Commonwealth budget. In running a modern society and economy, the government is cognisant of the fact that education plays a key role in preparing its citizens to meet the economic challenges that face them today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen enormous changes take place in the Australian economy over the past decade. Significant changes in global markets and the introduction of new technologies have created a demand for Australians to be very flexible and adaptive in their workplaces. At the core of preparing for the challenges of the new industrial workplace is education. If we are to ensure that all Australians have the opportunity to share the wealth of the nation, and if we are to achieve social justice within this society, then we must pour resources at the Commonwealth level into education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the elements of this bill are concerned, there are two very important provisions that relate to the achievement of the government's social justice objectives. The first is the extension of the early literacy program into 1996. The government has allocated some $8.9 million in 1996 to this program, which is directed at the detection of early literacy problems in students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think we ought to walk away from the sad reality that many Australians are unable to read. That problem is not confined to the younger people in our population; it is a widespread problem across all ages. Problems with illiteracy come from a multitude of causes: it may be a physical limitation of the individual concerned; it may well be the failure of schools to really complete the educational task, or it might be due to social factors such as poverty or the fact that the person has migrated to Australia and does not have a very good command of the language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs to society of illiteracy are enormous. The cost to the individuals can be appreciated by the fact that they are not empowered in a personal sense and have difficulty functioning in society. As far as the economy is concerned, modern industry relies on a work force that is literate, that not only possesses the ability to read but also understands the need for change and can appreciate, to some degree, the environment in which the enterprise is operating at the domestic and international level. Of course, those problems are compounded in enterprises where workers do not have base standards of literacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that the government has, through this program, sought to address the problems of literacy in our schools. Prevention is better than cure and, if we can put resources into schools and into these institutions at the early stages of the development of individuals to ensure that they are able to read and they are able to write, then it certainly overcomes problems later on. It is less costly in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important provision of this bill is the assistance that it provides to non-government schools to assist students with disabilities. The government is providing some $3.2 million in 1996 to a program which is designed to assist students with disabilities with that transition to mainstream education, employment or further training. I guess that at this point we ought to reflect on the roles that governments play in our society. It is very clear that the marketplace, left to itself in the educational area, will not ensure a clear flow of resources to people with disabilities, or provide them with the opportunities once they leave school to participate in the economic life of the nation. There is extra special tuition required, and extra resources have been made available through this program to assist those people with their integration into further education and training or into the work force. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has a demonstrated commitment, not a fabricated commitment, to education at all levels of education in Australia. For example, at the higher education level the federal government commits some $1.5 billion to the education of young and older Australians. In my electorate, we have one of the best universities in the nation, Deakin University, which was recently acknowledged by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) in the quality awards that were given. It is a major employer in Geelong; it provides quality programs, especially in the area of distance education. It has been an important climb up the quality ladder for Deakin University and I pay tribute in this debate to the staff and, indeed, the students that make up this very important educational institution not only in Geelong but in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as vocational education and training is concerned, the federal government outlays some $768 million in this particular area. In Geelong we have a very important technical and further education institution&mdash;the Gordon Technical College. Recently, the federal government tipped in around $30 million to the Gordon Technical College to build the manufacturing industry training centre, which will service manufacturing industry in the Geelong region, and also to refurbish the heritage buildings at the Gordon. This will certainly make it a more attractive institution to students, especially those from overseas who are coming to the Gordon to study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as primary and secondary schools are concerned, this federal government has a demonstrated commitment to the extent of $3.14 billion in 1995, and that will increase to $3.18 billion in 1996.

In Geelong, a city that had excellent educational infrastructure assets&mdash;and still has&mdash;let me say what the Kennett government has done. It flogged off the Institute of Educational Administration, which would have provided a national focus on the city, as far as education is concerned. They have closed schools in the region. They have reduced staff numbers in schools and they have cut special education to pieces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the legacy of tory governments. We had them in Victoria before 1982 and the legacy that they left us to clean up in the state was a legacy of low retention rates, public schools that were poorly maintained, and a teaching profession that was not acknowledged for the contribution that it makes to the welfare of our students. I would like to comment on that teaching profession. Teachers today are called on not only to be teachers. They are called on to be administrators, mediators between students and their families, counsellors to students, and innovators within the school and the larger industrial environment. These are the qualities that are required of the modern-day teacher. But we know that the coalition parties do not hold the teaching profession in very high esteem. We do, on this side of the House, because we appreciate the enormous contribution that teachers make to the life of their communities, certainly to their students, and to the schools in which they teach. </PARA>

We must give our students within them the freedom to fail as well as the freedom to succeed. I think this is a point that is not understood by members opposite and other members of the community. Schools are indeed different institutions. They are not to be run strictly along business lines. It is not the function of teachers to go out and flog the school to seek sponsorship, which is what is happening in Victoria.

Unfortunately, as a result of the dispute between the teachers and the state government, we now have the situation where the interests of students are being sacrificed by a dispute that could have been resolved a long time ago had the state government been more reasonable in its approach with the teachers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention Premier Lawrence, who is now a member of this parliament, because she was the minister for education at a time that there was an education ministers conference in Darwin. From recollection, she went to that conference with about three people in her retinue and was absolutely staggered to find that the Commonwealth component of this conference involved a huge army, or caravanserai, of people from the ministry of education in Canberra. The reason she was staggered by this was the simple fact, as she pointed out in the media, that the Commonwealth government does not teach one single person. Yet they had this huge swag of people choofing into Darwin on the public purse, at a time when resources for education, around the nation, were under pressure. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to reflect on the way in which the standing of teachers has declined in our community, probably as a result of the decline in their income in relation to the rest of the community.

The amount of resources devoted to their education is obviously going to be a matter of great concern. In any particular system, whether it has a Labor government or it has coalition government, the standing of teachers, who are after all responsible for guiding and educating our youngsters as they move through the education system, must be something of extreme importance. </PARA>

As the member, I not only ought to but I do have a very significant interest in the way in which our schools are going, the way in which the education system is performing and in particular the relationship between the Commonwealth and state governments over the allocation of the valuable education resources to our schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say in relation to the dispute in Western Australia that I have been very disappointed in the way in which that has developed. I took the trouble to make a statement and send it to the schools because I was conscious that teachers and those responsible for administering the schools ought to know exactly where their local member stood. I wrote that our electorate is the fastest growing in Australia and the pressure on our schools and teachers is increasing exponentially with that growth. Coping with the speed of change is not easy but it is essential for the future of education in Western Australia, as it is around the country. Teachers are entrusted with up to 12 years of the major parts of our children's lives, in particular that key early period of education, and the bill deals with the aspects of literacy and early education in its provisions. I believe teachers are dedicated, caring professionals who continually carry the wellbeing of their student charges at the forefront of their educational activities. Before I went into parliament I was a member of the Western Australian police force&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, I appreciate that. Teachers, along with nurses and police officers, are probably the most selfless members of our community's public service. I do not mean to demean the role played by other public servants, because they all provide a service to our community, but I think that people in those three key areas carry an enormous amount of the burden of the interaction between the most critical parts of our community's activities and functions, and in particular in relation to the key components of state government funding they are probably the most critical areas&mdash;education, health and law enforcement services. Teachers, like policemen, nurses and those in medical services, must be held in high regard by our community for the vital developmental role they play in the lives of children. To underpay them for this service is to undervalue their role in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that in all sincerity. In the economic assessment of each person's contribution to our community, the role that teachers play must surely occupy a far more important status than their remuneration would indicate. It is quite ridiculous that teachers and schools seem to be continually at the dog end of the allocation of valuable resources, when you consider the importance of their role not only in the education of our children but also as providers of that institutional influence within our communities at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know from my contacts within the community that teachers, by and large, put in hours and efforts far beyond their mere physical presence in schools. The pressures faced by teachers, including rising class sizes in some schools, could be compared to those of an actor appearing on stage for many hours a day, as opposed to putting on a performance once in the evening or the afternoon. That is the extent of the pressure that teachers have to put up with every day in their teaching&mdash;or, as they call it, the chalk board front end of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The teaching profession has been the subject of misguided policy by both Labor and Liberal administrations. Where adequate increases in remuneration were warranted, which would have reflected teachers' standing in the community, previous Labor governments substituted extra trade-offs in conditions of employment. Unfortunately, the Liberal government is now seeking to remove some of these trade-offs, and offering a small increase in salaries in exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many teachers work in schools in which dilapidated facilities are not conducive to pride in their work and effective teaching methods. As it should be, education is one of the biggest items in the Western Australian state budget, as I imagine it is around the country. It is time that the government overhauled the education system to reflect not only the standing of teachers in the community but also the genuine desire to have our children taught in schools which are pleasant, safe and learning-conducive environments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a subject of some concern, and even of distress, that in many schools there are temporary classrooms which are constructed of materials that, in the Western Australian summertime, produce quite extraordinary temperature ranges. This is particularly so in the northern parts of the state, but also applies to the metropolitan areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of years ago when temperatures went up quite markedly, I took the trouble to contact the RSPCA. Children, parents and teachers had complained about the temperatures in some of these classrooms, which were in coastal areas. Temperatures in those classrooms were almost up to 50 degrees during the day. I rang the RSPCA because I believed that, if somebody had let a pet animal into such an environment, the RSPCA would come out and remove it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was true. If somebody had rung them up and said, `The temperature in this room is 50 degrees plus,'  they would have been obliged to come in and remove the animal. Yet our children were, and are still, obliged to put up with these conditions. Not only is this inhumane, but it is hardly likely to assist the better education of the children, or the better performance of their teachers. It is coming towards summer now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments, both Labor and Liberal, said that they were introducing air cooling and airconditioning into these particular classrooms, but that this would take some time to take effect in the coastal plain, including Perth. It is ludicrous that in many cases we are still waiting for this basic environmental conditioning, to allow kids to be able to get on with learning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support teachers; I support quality education in Western Australia and in Australia. I support a negotiated settlement to the current industrial dispute&mdash;which reflects the importance of teaching to the families in the northern suburbs. During the recent tremors of this industrial dispute, there was a particular day when teachers had a stop-work meeting to consider the government's offer. Teachers attending that meeting were given a pay cut of one day, even though many of them missed only two hours. In some of the schools in my electorate they went back to school and resumed their normal responsibilities, albeit with a two-hour gap. Yet they were docked one day's pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my way of thinking, that is not only grossly unfair but, I think, undermines the relationship between the community and the teachers&mdash;and, of course, the government. It seemed to me something of a concern that teachers were treated in such a heavy-handed fashion at a time when there was an impasse between the state government, with its pay offer, and the state schoolteachers union, which has raised a number of considerations which it considers important in response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have often conducted visits to the schools in my electorate and, of course, have discovered that in some of them&mdash;one of the classic cases is the Wanneroo Senior High School&mdash;conditions in which teachers and students must work are less than acceptable. In my view, the preventive maintenance program of the education ministry in Western Australia needs to be considerably beefed up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recollect that a couple of years ago, back when I first became a member of this House, the then Labor government had allocated something like $22,000 for the preventive maintenance program when, in my electorate, in the Joondalup district as it was then called, there was about $700,000 of preventative maintenance work required to be undertaken. We had the silly situation where we found that a great chunk of that $22,000 was taken up by the building management authority in just inspecting the cooling and ventilation systems in the various schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect in the relationship between government and non-government schools, which has been raised by this particular bill, is the fact that government schools have obligations to educate and to look after particular students, notwithstanding their difficulties or their particular behavioural problems. This is where we have a situation in my electorate, with its great concentration of youngsters, where we have seen quite clearly the retention rate rise or progressively go up as the unemployment situation has deteriorated in the country and in the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the situation where students who otherwise would have been in work, out of the school system, were left back in there basically twiddling their thumbs because they had nowhere else to go. This has led to situations where teachers have been placed in the unfortunate situation of having to deal with disruptive or difficult students without the proper assistance of adequate social workers and other support that would assist them to be able to deal with those types of problems. For instance, at one particular senior high school, there were 14 clearly problem students who were causing disruption within the classrooms&mdash;something for which they had to accept responsibility&mdash;but unfortunately they did not have the sort of back-up that they ought to be entitled to as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that, in all of this dispute, the focus has been purely and simply on the question of a particular pay rate without examining some of the aspects of the implications for the students themselves. I might just point out some of the trade-offs that are being proposed: there will be staffing meetings out of school instructional time, with implications for students and less time for marking and preparation out of instructional hours; the hours of instruction that students receive will increase with no extra staffing to alleviate the extra workload, and less marking and preparation may result in a decline in the quality of teaching; local merit selection of staff will replace centrally controlled transfer system so that teachers seeking transfer to another school will spend more time on preparing a resume at the expense of marking and preparation for the benefit of students; and there may be some aspects of nepotism in some schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an area which could be developed to the betterment of the interests of students. Unfortunately, because of the way in which this whole issue has been developed by the education department and, in particular, the Minister for Education in WA, this has now become a subject of contention, where otherwise it could have been a subject for the betterment or progressive development of our school system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the staffing profile, schools receive a national personnel budget allocation for all teaching and support staff. The implications are that schools may sacrifice highly paid, experienced teachers for lower paid, inexperienced teachers or support staff. Teachers who participate in the educational debate may no longer be wanted in the new staffing profile, stifling the development of new ideas in school. There are others, such as the removal of discriminatory leave provisions and adding new leave provisions; an increase in schools grants by at least three per cent in real terms; employment of an additional 100 teachers to reduce class sizes for additional integration of students with learning difficulties; the employment of additional sports staff in all schools; and the $1.5 million investment in adequate provision of professional development and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of these cases we see a situation where, in the final analysis or at the bottom line, the interests of our children in our community are being traded in a way that is not conducive to their better education. The dispute is being, unfortunately, progressed in a way that is leading to fewer opportunities for the children themselves. At the end of the day, those in year 12&mdash;the final year leavers, who are going to be put under enormous pressure as they approach their exams&mdash;will have had their entire year 12 more or less subject to industrial disputes that could have been settled at an earlier stage, had there been a much greater sense of goodwill and cooperation on the part of the state government ministry. I have to say that but I must say, in fairness, that the previous Labor administrations were also pretty awful as far as the education system was concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I understand that the delivery of telephony and pay television by cable will in some instances result in more wiring and associated equipment being mounted on existing power poles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that Optus will, where aerial infrastructure exists, co-locate with it. Where existing aerial cable is proposed to be put underground, Optus has indicated that it will pay a share of the costs, thereby subsidising the cost of underground electricity supply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telstra has advised that some cable for pay television and associated equipment will need to be located on existing power poles. It expects that this will be in the order of 20 per cent of the street cable and will generally occur in areas where the existing telephony system is aerial and it is cost prohibitive to install underground cabling. In addition some of the "lead-in" cabling will be aerial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government has held discussions with both Optus and Telstra to obtain general information about their respective plans to deliver communication services, including pay television and telephony by cable on power poles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The decision to deliver pay television services by cable on power poles is one for the carriers, subject to the carriers aerial deployment abiding by relevant Commonwealth legislation (including in particular Part 7 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 and the Telecommunications National Code).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) In relation to cabling laid by the telecommunications carriers, the Government has in place the Telecommunications National Code which has the objective (among other things) of requiring carriers to develop or provide infrastructure in a manner that has full regard to the need to maximise the protection of Australia's natural environmental and cultural heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) There may be some areas where the cable television rollout of Telstra and Optus will coincide and the services will be delivered through separate infrastructure. However, as the majority of Telstra's cabling will be underground it seems unlikely that there will be many areas where Optus and Telstra will both have cables mounted on power poles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The provision of telecommunications infrastructure, including the mounting of telecommunications cable on power poles by telecommunications carriers, is subject to the Telecommunications Act 1991, The Telecommunications (Exempt Activities) Regulations, and the Telecommunications National Code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The Government has no specific requirement in place to require carriers to notify Members of Parliament about their plans for provision of pay TV by overhead cabling.
