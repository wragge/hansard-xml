<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on 6 March 1995, of Senator Alice Olive Zakharov, a Senator for the State of Victoria since 1982, places on record its appreciation of her long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to her family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>Olive Zakharov was born on 19 March 1929 in Melbourne. Olive held a degree in arts from Melbourne University and also gained professional qualifications in counselling. These skills were effectively employed in her career as a teacher and student counsellor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive also worked in many other occupations. She was a registered psychologist, a pathology assistant, a shop assistant, a mail officer, a waitress and a fruit picker. She grew up in the Depression years and later experienced the enormous difficulties of being a single mother without the support mechanisms that are available to women today. She was willing to turn her hand to almost any job to support her family. Her unswerving commitment to social justice and peace was born in these early years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive came to the Senate in 1983, having already established a career and raised her family. She had been a longstanding member of the Labor Party and was an executive member of the Montmorency branch for 20 years. When asked why she started her parliamentary career so late in life, she likened herself to the veteran runner Cliff Young when she said, `Late runs can be very successful.' She also said that this question, when asked of women, points to a lack of understanding about women's lives and about her own life as a sole parent with children to raise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When she reached the Senate, among her many contributions were her role as Temporary Chairman of Committees and, significantly, her work as chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. She also served effectively in the estimates committee processes, on the Senate Standing Committees on Community Affairs, Regulations and Ordinances, Senators' Interests, National Resources, Environment, Recreation and the Arts, on the Joint Committee on ASIO, on the Joint House Committee, and on the Senate Select Committees on Video Material and on the Human Embryo Experimentation Bill. This broad range of participation shows us her commitment and dedication to making the world a better place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive was acknowledged as the Humanist of the Year in 1984. She was a noted participant and contributor to the peace movement, being a member of the Campaign for International Cooperation and Disarmament and of World Women Parliamentarians for Peace. Olive represented the Australian peace movement in 1988 as a witness of the first destruction of a nuclear missile in the USSR and the START treaty, and was Australian delegate to the Vienna Peace Conference in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A committed trade unionist and feminist, Olive was involved in affirmative action development. Her earlier life and work experiences as a part-time student and employee strengthened her understanding of the female's role in society and also heightened her strong commitment to social justice. A long-time crusader for women's rights, she was well known for her stand against domestic violence. The measure of her courage and personal strength was demonstrated when, in 1993, she spoke publicly about the mental and physical abuse she had suffered. She was prepared to do this because she thought it would make it in some way easier for other women to confront their own experiences of domestic violence&mdash;and seek support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive worked hard to improve women's working conditions, focusing particularly on sexual harassment issues. She was a strong supporter of the sexual discrimination legislation. Her fight for women, the disadvantaged and, more recently, the rights of homosexuals was well known and widely documented. Her commitment came from the heart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She worked at making herself accessible to her electorate and even made sure that her office was located in a shopping centre which was well serviced by public transport. This may seem a small thing, but it demonstrated support for effective democracy by being available at all times to people who needed help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of Olive's favourite quotes which she would refer to was from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hamlet</EMPHASIS>. This, she said, epitomised her personal philosophy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This above all: to thine own self be true. And it must follow, as the night follows day. Thou cannot then be false to any man . . .</PARA>
<PARA>and to this, Olive added `woman'. Olive was a socialist, a unionist and a feminist, and today we remember her term of office to the people of Victoria and the women of Australia. I know that the death of Olive Zakharov has come as a shock to us all and we are deeply saddened. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) also extends his sympathy to the family and will be issuing a separate statement about Olive later in the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the day that Olive was involved in the accident, which ultimately was to lead to the loss of her life, she came racing across Station Pier to lobby me about the Seamen's Mission building down in Port Melbourne which she felt ought to be preserved. I remember at the time feeling what an effort it must have been, knowing how long Station Pier is if you have to run it. She went on later that day to a function associated with the commitment that she had to the gay rights movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I got to know Olive Zakharov as well as I got to know any member of the parliament. She was always a low key person, but she was at the same time a person of enormous commitment&mdash;commitment to values of social justice, to building a more peaceful world, to creating a society which was more participatory and to earning some recognition for the enormous challenges women face as they come into this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive was, on our side of politics, a pioneer&mdash;someone who I think was able to demonstrate, through her own commitment and her own work, the importance of broadening the representation of this parliament so that one day there will be equality of sexes, one day there will be in this parliament a recognition that women have the opportunity here to speak for that half of the population they represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the government, I extend to her children, Martin, Robin and Jeannie, our most sincere sympathy at this time of their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the parliamentary Liberal Party, I would like to associate myself with the motion just moved by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe). The distressing circumstances of Senator Zakharov's death are known to all of us, and I particularly want to convey to her three children our sympathy and to record both my respect and that of my parliamentary colleagues for the faithful way in which she represented the values that she held and the beliefs that she brought to this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not pretend that on some issues I would have had similar views to the late senator, but that is the nature of politics and, as the Acting Prime Minister said in quoting those memorable words from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hamlet</EMPHASIS>, being true to yourself and what you believe in is the best thing that people can bring to public life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not know Senator Olive Zakharov very well. I suppose it is the nature of this place that, if you are in the House of Representatives and somebody else is in the Senate, and they are on the other side and they are not a member of the cabinet or of the shadow cabinet, you do not see a lot of them. But my recollection of her is that she was an immensely courteous person whenever I met her, and a very friendly one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do recall a few months ago hearing an interview that she gave on a current affairs program on the issue of domestic violence&mdash;something to which the Acting Prime Minister has referred. I think one can say without any fear of contradiction that, whatever our differences may be on other political issues, all Australians would be united in feeling a sense of revulsion on the issue of domestic violence. And violence against women, either in the home or in any other part of the community, is something that ought to earn the continuing condemnation of people right across the political spectrum. It is one of those issues that does unite what are often classed as `conservative' groups in the community and others that are classed as rather more radical, progressive groups in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought that what she said on that occasion had great impact. She certainly was, to use an old and revered Australian expression, very much a `battler' in her early life. The difficulties she obviously experienced and the responsibilities involved in bringing up three children on her own&mdash;and obviously in very difficult circumstances&mdash;qualified her very clearly for that description. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was committed to a number of causes that, of course, in the 1960s and 1970s would have found her on the other side of the argument, certainly from me and, I guess, from most of my colleagues, and perhaps even from some of her own colleagues at that particular time. But this is not an occasion to do other than to note those things with the respect that strongly held differing political views deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like, therefore, to in every way associate myself with what has been said by the Acting Prime Minister. I know the loss of a colleague in these sorts of circumstances is not only distressing for the colleague's family but also for those who have been very closely associated with them. I know there will be many people in the Australian Labor Party today who will feel very keenly her loss. I respect that and I understand that and, on behalf of my party, I join the Acting Prime Minister in conveying sympathy to her family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too join with the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in supporting this motion of condolence with regard to the untimely death of the late Senator Olive Zakharov.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two things I would like to add. Senator Zakharov chose to pursue her interests and activities as a senator in fields far and wide. It is not generally known that she took a particular interest in travelling to Antarctica as part of her Senate work in conjunction with the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and others, and maintained an interest in the Australian government and scientific activities in our Antarctic territories over her period subsequent to visiting that place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She also travelled to a lonely military outpost on the Russia-China border a few years back to witness the destruction of some weaponry in that location&mdash;an issue which, I must say, she was consistent about over her whole lifetime. It must have been a particular reward and delight for her to be there as part of that particular treaty adherence to see, physically, the destruction of that Russian weaponry in that location. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very saddened by the news of her accident a few weeks back and sent messages through on that occasion, and now on the news of her death. It is appropriate that, as we consider this condolence motion, I refer again to that very courageous press conference and interview to which the Leader of the Opposition referred. I could do no better than quote her two most relevant answers on the question of domestic violence where she emerged to put down her own personal circumstance in a way which, I hope, will make a contribution to lessening the degree of domestic violence which exists. It is far too much and, in a perfect world, there should not be any, but that is not reality. However, it is a testament to Senator Zakharov that she said on that occasion on 9 November 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I was in a violent domestic relationship for some years&mdash;not violent in the sense, I guess, my life was never in danger and I didn't end up in a casualty department of a hospital. But I did have to seek medical attention on several occasions, and certainly I was subject to not just a physical violence but a great deal of verbal violence and threats over a number of years. I discovered that a problem that I'd had with my eyesight relates to a head injury. That head injury was inflicted by my then husband in a serious case of concussion.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to make the very valid point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I think for one thing it shows that you can go through these experiences and survive them and lead a full and happy life afterwards. There are people in positions where they can influence policy and so on who do understand about the situation&mdash;the situation of women and children who are the victims of violence. I am very happy now to feel free to take that step in the hope that it will help other women across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I salute the work of Senator Zakharov. I did not by any means agree with all that she pursued as a senator and as a member of the Labor Party from the state of Victoria, but in my own visit to Antarctica and elsewhere I encountered her on many occasions and found her to be a perfectly pleasant lady to spend time with. She was obviously a soul mate of the Acting Prime Minister. I extend the sympathy of members of the National Party of Australia to members of the Zakharov family and to the Acting Prime Minister. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Fremantle-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Minister for Human Services and Health)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I very strongly support the motion of condolence and the tributes already paid, and no doubt those that will be paid, to Olive Zakharov. I had not known Olive for as long as many. Nonetheless, when I and my staff first heard of her accident and now of her death, we were struck by a sense of emptiness as she had been one of the crutches that held us up and helped us to do jobs that we do. So many of the issues that I confront as the Minister for Human Services and Health and as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women were worthy issues that Olive had committed her life to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have heard, Olive was committed to equality for women, the aged and the frail, the disabled, the mentally ill, sufferers of AIDS and, generally speaking, the less disadvantaged in our community. Her record shows very clearly that her commitment to social justice was not transient and had no element of opportunism about it. For Olive Zakharov, issues of social justice were not soft issues or issues to be picked up and dropped depending on the political environment or for a photo opportunity. Her parliamentary record, and indeed her record before she entered parliament, show a consistent and unwavering commitment to the most disadvantaged in our communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this respect, Olive Zakharov was the heart and soul of the Labor Party&mdash;a no-nonsense worker but also a very passionate worker. She was a senator who was prepared to fight against injustice in the community and also prepared to fight to keep the important rights that had already been won. Olive did not like to see any backsliding, and she would remind us constantly that we should not allow it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure many members would be aware that last year Labor women fought particularly hard and won a rule change which will ensure greater representation of women in our parliaments. It was a matter about which Olive Zakharov felt very strongly. In the lead-up to the decision to ensure Labor women made up at least 35 per cent of all winnable seats by the next two elections I spoke a lot, but Olive did a lot to make sure that the rule was changed. She argued, as many of us did, that until our parliaments better reflect the composition of the Australian community our parliaments would necessarily be weaker and democracy would continue to suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The victory that we had on our side of politics represents an important victory for Australian women. It was also a victory for Olive Zakharov because, as her career indicates, it is not easy for women to become politicians in the first place and, when they do, they have a lot to offer that is not always recognised. Olive, as many of you will know, was the only woman Labor representative from Victoria. Her story of preselection is sadly similar to that of many female politicians, and I am sure she would not mind if I take the opportunity to remind us of that. She was never ordained for a safe position on the Senate ticket. She won it from the third spot on the Labor ticket. She was elected as senator for Victoria in 1983 and re-elected in 1984, 1987 and 1993. So she has been with us for the life of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive Zakharov's continuous re-election against the odds in many respects demonstrated her enormous courage and her preparedness to bat on for the sake of women's representation in our parliaments. Her experience of government coupled with her work and life experiences made her an asset to the women's movement and will continue to make her an asset in her memory. She will remain an asset too to the Labor Party and to this parliament. I know I speak for a great many people in this community, including a great many women, when I say in her passing she will be sadly missed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, it was with a great feeling of shock that I heard on the radio this morning of the death of Senator Olive Zakharov. I knew Olive from the time she was first elected to the Senate almost exactly 12 years ago when I also was in the Senate. Our mutual interest in education put us in one another's company from the beginning, although on opposite sides of politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive was a person who may not have been very well-known to members on this side of the House of Representatives unless they came from her state. She may even have been a little misunderstood. Olive was a gentle, quiet but firm personality who was always courteous, very considerate and very reasonable. She was an idealist, as was revealed in debate in parliament and through her other activities which have been outlined today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive was also doggedly egalitarian. You learned this, as you would know, Mr Speaker, through serving on the Joint House Committee with her. Even there she was always trying to look after the little person. At yesterday's meeting committee members decided to send a message of good wishes to her for her return to health, but that message will never reach her or her family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think we should spend too much time talking about Olive's courage in revealing her domestic violence experience because it is almost starting to sound&mdash;certainly from the radio broadcasts&mdash;as though that is all she did. Of course that is not so. Nevertheless, I am not sure that all the men in this parliament understand what sort of courage it took on Olive's part to speak about domestic violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Domestic violence is a crime for which, classically, many people blame the victim. They think that the victim has done something shameful and has brought it upon themselves. Olive was prepared to run the risk of that sort of ridicule, whether public or private. She was also prepared to risk something that is precious to all of us who are in public life&mdash;that is, the loss of her personal privacy. It must have revived many painful memories for her, memories she would have wanted to have long since put behind her. She would have been aware that it would revive painful memories for those she loved, her family. Olive never wore these experiences as a badge but talked about them only to help others. She made the point that being a victim of violence was not something of which any woman should be ashamed, but rather something we should all&mdash;those of us who are fortunate enough to be in a position to do something about it&mdash;be as brave as she was in tackling.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, it is extremely difficult for those of us who were close to Olive Zakharov to speak now. It is too soon, and the grief is too painful. But I will not cry: you don't cry in the parliament. Indeed, tears for people you love should be very private tears.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But as this motion goes to the family I have to speak, so I will say something very briefly to the family and then to the parliament. I say to the family that we actually share your loss in a most direct and personal way, firstly in understanding only now that the loss is such a shock, even though we were prepared for it; and, secondly, that Olive is just not there for us where she has always been. The family of course understands that so well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the 1983 election there have been all those committees, all those caucuses and all those meetings, and Olive was always there. There were even the little things you could do together in the parliament, such as eating together. It is simply impossible to believe that she is no longer there where we always looked for her. Beyond this place there were the marches, the rallies and all those tiny groups that others were too busy for but that Olive had time for. She was always there for women and for those in trouble. She never forgot their struggle because she had been through it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the parliament and to the observers of the political process, I want to say this: Olive was not here for fame and fortune&mdash;she was not famous in media terms&mdash;but her role is of immense influence and significance to all those who were surprised to find that a politician is someone who is loyal and true, whose commitment is personal and whose dedication to unpopular causes is solid, unflinching and steadfast. Those causes so often become eventually acknowledged as mainstream concerns and often because of the years and years of unrecognised work by people like Olive Zakharov. So Olive's role is extremely important to the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But almost always this role is ignored by the media. If a politician is not playing the political game, is not becoming famous, is not climbing the ladder, that politician's role is almost always unacknowledged and even derided as not being successful. But what should be recognised is the role and the contribution of the backbencher, the committee worker and the winner of elections. That is what people like Olive do for their party. When Olive stood in 1993 she had every reason to look forward to retirement, to look forward to having at last the time to do the things that she had never had time to do or had been able to afford to do, but she realised there was no woman standing for the Labor Party from Victoria. So, as has been said, for a cause she stood for the third seat and, of course, she won. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say something about what Olive meant for me. The best thing about Olive was that she was so hardline. You always knew exactly what Olive felt about everything. Olive one day said to me that she wanted to come around to my office and see me. I asked, `What is it?' She said, `No, I must come to your office to see you.' I thought, `Good heavens, where have I failed? Where have I not been sufficiently hardline? Does Olive have to rebuke me?' But when she came she gave me a little plastic case in which was mounted a piece of that metal from the first destruction of nuclear weapons&mdash;a pretty important achievement for those who had stood around for years supporting the fringe issues. I will have that with me always. I have it with me always wherever I go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It reminds me of something else I have with me always&mdash;the scissors and letter opener that belong to Jessie Street that were given to me by her son. Those objects will be with me always, as they are, representing the achievement of two very different women from very different backgrounds who fought for exactly the same causes. It seems to me that, just as it was years and years before Jessie Street was fully  recognised and her role in the Australian community fully recognised, so it may be some time before we know how to recognise Olive Zakharov's work. But the thing that I would like to say for the future is that I hope we begin now to work out how we can make Olive's place more recognisable in history in the future than perhaps it was to most Australians during her absolutely wonderful lifetime. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly on this condolence motion. About three years ago I was with Olive on a visit to Scotland and found that that was her homeland. At that time Don Dobie was with us, so there was a bit of mixing of the two classes. On that occasion Olive, in a very dignified way, let us know what it meant to live in poverty, to be brought up in poverty, to have to work to support a family at a very early age and to be subject to class distinction. Having known her from that episode, that did not poison her mind in any way whatsoever in her attitude towards others and in the job she had to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It certainly struck me that her attitudes were formed from what she went through in her youth. Her personality was one of compassion and warmth to anybody who knew her. Nobody on either side of the House would ever say that Olive's and my politics would ever meet, but, when I was the shadow minister for disability services, I felt that those people throughout Australia who handled disability services knew that when they put a case to the committee for which she is the chairman they would be received and those decisions would be made on the facts and not on politics. I just want to say to Jeannie, whom I met on that occasion, that Mavis and I send our very warm sympathies to her and to the other members of the family. I am sure they have lost a great mother and a great inspiration, but they have a great example to follow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Olive Zakharov was a blithe spirit. She had borne the burden of poverty and had known and overcome hardship in her own life but rejected bitterness and frustration in favour of activism and compassion. I am touched to see a large number of members from both sides of the House present for this tribute for somebody from the other place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She came to the Senate at the age of 54, but her 12 years of service were years of growth, challenge, even adventure. As the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) pointed out, she was a great enthusiast for the Antarctic. Her interests were global, local and personal. She was passionately committed to the cause of peace and disarmament, and to overcoming global poverty&mdash;in which women and children were particular victims&mdash;and environmental pollution problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the local level she was equally passionate in her commitment to community values, working against injustice, to networking and to the preservation of things of value. The story that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe) told about her last words on the Seamen's Mission building being preserved is very characteristic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the personal level, she worked to overcome personal prejudice and legal discrimination against sexual minorities and victims of AIDS and mental illness. She wanted to improve the lives of women and children and protect them from domestic violence and the impact of poverty, and she wanted to secure social justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She epitomised the best values of the Labor movement: the human face&mdash;alas, not the only one&mdash;of politics.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the condolence motion before the House. I want to speak of Olive Zakharov in another context. She was, of course, as we all know, a distinguished senator, but for me she was not merely a constituent; she was a close political colleague.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She lived in Port Melbourne in a street called Swallow Street, which is certainly not the flashest street in my electorate or in Melbourne. On one occasion a Labor government decided that it was going to put a development into the whole Port Melbourne area, which she and I opposed. With some courage and commitment, and on behalf of a local community, she formed what is still known as the Swallow Street Association. That was a commitment by her, taking on people in her own party on behalf of people who were her community. She loved them and served them and they loved her and respected her in return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was typical, as the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe) said, that on what we now know to be the last day of her conscious life she turned up at a function&mdash;apparently her invitation had been mislaid or not received&mdash;having run almost the full distance of Station Pier in order to lobby&mdash;I hope successfully&mdash;him and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus). Why? Because there is an old building that neither the state government nor the local community know quite what to do with, but that is an historic building and an important building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think she stopped running for the rest of the day because in a matter of a few hours she was at the Mid-summa festival, a festival for gay and lesbian people. It is often forgotten that, when it was not such a popular cause  to  support  those  groups,  Olive Zakharov, because she could not stand any kind of discrimination and because of her commitment to people, was one of the first people in this parliament to say there is no such thing as a second-rate Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her death I think diminishes all of us, but her life and her commitment to the Australian people strengthens all of us. I certainly was privileged to know and work with her on a variety of causes. She is one of the few senators that I know who did not merely have a commitment to and involvement with the great issues that faced the nation but never forgot the people of Swallow Street, never forgot the people of Port Melbourne, and was as actively involved with important local issues as she was in her commitment to her broader political role. </PARA>

Our annual dinner to be held in May will be greatly diminished by her absence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Zakharov was the chair of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, which in December 1985 tabled a report examining issues relating to the exploitation of the natural resources of the Australian Antarctic Territory. She visited Casey base in late 1984 and early 1985, travelling on the MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iceberg</EMPHASIS> and becoming probably the first female member of the Australian parliament to travel to Antarctica by ship. I know that Senator Melzer also visited Antarctica, but she flew there. Olive, like many of us, went on the MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iceberg</EMPHASIS> and endured that two-week journey. I think she was the first female member of the Australian parliament to travel to Antarctica by ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1984, as part of the inspections for her committee inquiry, she took part in the Macquarie Island airdrop, which involved dropping mail, fresh fruit and vegetables from a RAAF Hercules at a height of only 200 feet. I have been told that she greatly enjoyed that experience. Because of her professional background, she also took a very keen interest in the selection procedure for the Antarctic expeditioners. She always showed a keen interest in environmental issues.

The Australian national Antarctic research expeditions have lost a great supporter. I can recall the very first time that I became aware of her and saw her name: it was on the MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iceberg</EMPHASIS>, the vessel mentioned by the member for Throsby.

In this regard, Olive was exceptional for two reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, few members of our parliamentary party put themselves forward to serve on that committee. It is usually seen as fairly dry and technical, and there is only a handful of volunteers. Secondly, and more importantly, most who do put themselves forward have legal qualifications. Olive did not, but she saw justice as being the reason why we enact laws. The role of the committee was enlivened by the fact that she would come along to every meeting&mdash;and I mean every meeting&mdash;and put a commonsense point of view and look to principle at all times. Certainly, both the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and I were made aware in our every endeavour that the matters we were dealing with were not simply technical or black-letter law but also issues that profoundly affected the rights of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive Zakharov has left some very important legacies. Her commitment to the rights of creative people&mdash;journalists, artists and the like&mdash;has significantly affected the way in which I, and the government as a whole, addressed some of the issues which have come before us. In the area of civil liberties, her commitment to personal individual rights was very important. Her recognition that women in the community are in a vulnerable position and have been afflicted by violence and the like led her to accept that there were needs to be addressed in that regard. That also has had a very significant impact on the way in which our government has operated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I too join with the comments regarding her commitment to Antarctica. Her commitment to the rights of those who are part of the gay and lesbian community, I think, is well known and has already been commented upon.

I made a mistake one day in a committee. I made the comment, `It is all right for you senators, you do not have constituents to worry about.' That was the wrong thing to say in front of Olive.

She was totally committed to the women of Australia&mdash;whether they be women on the streets, whether they be women struggling to gain education or advantage in some place in this country, whether they be women in rural areas, whether they be urban women, whether they be older women or whether they be younger women. Olive was always there to put their case, to argue their case and to make sure that those of us who occasionally might waiver for one reason or another did not do it if it meant that some disadvantage might be seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to pay tribute to my friend and to my colleague. I extend to her family, her friends and her staff my deepest sympathy. I know that many people throughout Australia would want those of us here today to extend that sympathy to Olive's friends. We have lost a very great Australian. We have lost a woman who I believe will go down in history. She will never be forgotten by many of us. I believe that Australians will get to know the work that she has done for them in this place and in this country. </PARA>

From listening to what a lot of other people have said here today and hearing a lot of things that I did not know about Olive, I know that that is exactly what she meant.

My first and most prominent memories of Olive are on backbench committees, in particular the education committee. Much has been said about Olive's contribution in terms of her committee work. As I listened to speeches, I was reminded of the fact that around this place at least it is usually the people who stand in this position or who have positions of prominence that get all the attention. Indeed, in some places and according to some commentators it is the amount of column inches you get around this place that determines your worth. I have never thought that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a sad honour for me today to rise and speak of Olive Zakharov, senator for Victoria&mdash;that was her title and responsibility which she took frighteningly seriously. I met Olive Zakharov back in the 1970s when I joined the Labor Party in the Diamond Valley area in Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She had been deeply involved for many years, long before I was; in fact, long before most. She worked in education, as we know, not just as a teacher in front of a class but as a student counsellor, characteristically very much involved with helping people through her work. I am sure that today there are many hundreds and thousands of people from her days in education who know how much they owe Olive Zakharov for what she did for them in those formative years of their lives. Just as there are many hundreds of thousands of people throughout Victoria, indeed Australia and other parts of the world, who met or saw Olive Zakharov and who in one way or another would never have failed to be impressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, her contribution and commitment have been one of the most diverse and constant that I have known of anyone in public life and in public office. She was elected in 1983 as a senator for Victoria, as we know. As a number of members, in particular those members from rural and regional areas and from the opposition, have mentioned today, she travelled endlessly to far off places, out of the way places&mdash;places where the aircraft did not reach. She spent many hours on those long bumpy, dusty roads to get to people&mdash;very characteristically an Olive thing to do. There are today so many people in rural and regional Victoria and rural and regional Australia who know Olive and will certainly mourn her passing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a former minister for aged care and family services and such like, I know the commitment that Olive had to those sorts of issues. There are believers, there are true believers and there are true, true believers. Olive was a true, true believer. She was a woman who believed in and acted Labor's finest principles and traditions. She touched, dealt with and fought for issues that others would not touch and, in some cases, could not be bothered to touch. That was symptomatic of the way she moved around the countryside, involving herself with people, bringing back the messages to the government and to the ministers&mdash;such as me&mdash;to get what she thought those people deserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She had a way of dealing with people who were suffering disadvantage or suffering injustice. She was not prepared to see them go through it any further. Her workload was immense. Some might think she was a workaholic; I do not think she was. It was just that she could not bear to see people suffer disadvantage, to see people suffer injustice. That applied globally; it applied across the world in so many organisations she involved herself with and in the issues she took up&mdash;political, environmental, social and human rights. Principally, she was always putting to the fore the role and status of women. She did it globally, locally and individually. She was a person with incredible vigour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect, as I think we all do, that her mind would have been dealing with a lot of those matters that were constantly driving her when she stepped out onto the road.

I share the honour to have known her, to have worked with her, to have learnt from her and to have been inspired by her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a criterion of success in political life: if you can leave politics with your integrity undiminished, you have in many ways been successful. For Olive Zakharov, her already great integrity became deeper and deeper as time went on and as we got to know her better. What is more, she encouraged that deeper integrity in everyone around her. Principally, we honour her today as a senator for Victoria and, indeed, as a human being; primarily, we honour her as a woman who has been a magnificent success and inspiration and an example of the best of the human spirit.

I knew her as a good comrade in the Left; I knew her as an active participant on the caucus community services committee, of which I have been a member for five years; and I knew her on the social justice committee and on extraparliamentary groups such as Parliamentarians for East Timor and Parliamentarians for Global Action, both of which reflected her very strong commitment to human rights, to peace and to disarmament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also knew her as a member of the ASIO committee, a committee that has not been mentioned here yet. It was always a delicious irony for Olive Zakharov that she managed for a period of time to be acting chair of the ASIO committee. ASIO headquarters probably had quite a big file on her because of her political activities in the 1960s and 1970s, and she thought it was very good that she now was in charge of the parliamentary supervision of the people that had haunted her for so long in her political activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My best impressions of her come from the work on the community services committee, which I now chair. My first remembrance of her, after I had been elected to the caucus community services committee, was her part in the dynamic duo of Pat Giles and Olive Zakharov. They were certainly quite a formidable team. When they had an issue that they wanted to pursue, or if anybody dared raise a matter that they felt was very much against the best interests of social justice, they certainly let you know about it. I took them on only once and lived to tell the tale, but I never did it again. They certainly were ferocious fighters for social justice. As the chair of the community services committee, I will miss the great contribution she made to social justice in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is fully understood outside this place what important work does occur on those committees: the caucus committees, which give advice to government on what policies and programs we should be putting in place, and the House of Representatives and Senate standing committees. Olive was a very hard worker on all those committees. She played a really important role in keeping us on track and constantly vigilant about social justice and what we on this side of the House were seeking to achieve in our policies and our platforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said by some of my colleagues that she has inspired a lot of young women to be involved in politics. She has also inspired a lot of men. She was certainly an inspiration to me as a role model as a very effective grassroots, committed representative of the people. If I could in any way emulate the way in which she operated, then I would be very proud to have been able to serve the people of Australia the way she has served. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think people do not often understand the hard work that is involved in being an effective grassroots representative of the people and in picking up the issues. One of the important roles that senators can play is by picking up the issues that are not necessarily politically popular at the time. She certainly fulfilled all of the responsibilities and obligations as a senator in being strong and supporting a whole range of groups that did not have a lot of votes around them or did not have a lot of numbers of people involved but were very important components of our community. For that, she will be very sorely missed by her colleagues, by the broader Victorian community and by the Australian community. I offer my sincere condolences to her family at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to participate in this condolence debate for Olive Zakharov. I think it has more or less all been said but it is very clear that Senator Zakharov was a long time activist.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) said, that Senator Zakharov had been a victim of the surveillance and intrusiveness of that organisation during the Cold War and that she could have acted in a vindictive manner. She could have had some grudge to bear with ASIO and its officers, but she did not express that. As other members have said, she acted with total dignity and was always totally courteous to officers of ASIO as well as other witnesses before the committee. Because Olive cared, she rose above that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive was concerned about social justice. She was a woman of principle, and that shone through. It was for me a great honour to know and to work with Olive Zakharov inside and outside this parliament. Olive was a member of a great generation of left wing women, a generation that fought for peace, a generation that fought for the trade union movement at a time when it was not easy to do that&mdash;during the Cold War when members of organisations like ASIO, and I appreciate the irony that has been put forward by the honourable member for Moreton, were running around snooping into people's lives.

It is obviously not possible to sum up one's feelings and all the issues that one might like to comment on in a few minutes. But I want to refer to three small matters which illustrate how I feel. The first is her maiden speech on 25 May 1983. I will quote directly from that maiden speech, where she said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My commitment to social justice, focused now in my commitment to the Australian Labor Party, goes back as far as I can remember. My childhood was spent during the Depression of the 1930s and my father, who was a teacher, spent most of those years out of work, his only income being for piece-rate journalism at tuppence a published line. Some of my most vivid early memories are of men coming to the door to ask for money or food and men in the streets picking up butts, providing second hand tobacco for a cigarette. These memories and talk at home about the rise of fascism in Italy and Germany and the Spanish Civil War helped shape my commitment to peace and social justice which has finally brought me to this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA>That quote from her maiden speech sums up exactly the kind of person that she was. The most tremendous thing is that those sentiments in 1983 continued throughout the whole of her parliamentary career, as people have mentioned. She had the same commitment to social justice throughout it. It was not just a commitment in terms of the structures of the party; it was a commitment in terms of the basic ideals and principles of the party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember at the end of last year that she was sitting in the back row at the last state conference of the Labor Party. It was about 4 or 5 o'clock. All these tremendous issues had occurred. There were all the personality infights and the usual stuff that goes on at Labor Party conferences. Everyone had left, but we were still discussing fundamental education and social justice policies. Olive was sitting at the back&mdash;she was not right at the front being prominent&mdash;listening. I joined her and said, `What is going on?' She said, `It is very interesting. We are now discussing all these policies on social justice and education and they have all left. What is happening to the party?' I said, `You are still here. That is important.' She said to me, `We have to rejuvenate this party for a further commitment to social justice.' That sums up what Olive Zakharov was about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive had real courage in her support of the party. Everyone said that the third spot in the Senate would not be winnable in the last election. So all these very ambitious people were not interested in putting their name forward in that third spot. But Olive Zakharov still had that commitment to the party. She still felt that we could win that position. Against all the odds&mdash;and probably in the light of her own reputation&mdash;she stood for the third position and won it. The party had the advantage of that position, which the pundits had said would not be won. So she had courage as well. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive did many things for me personally and for many of us here. We have all heard so many speeches about what she has done. I can only say that the kind of spirit, dedication and support for principle that she showed is a shining beacon for us all. We will remember her for many years.

The moulding of Olive Zakharov could only have been in that way and in that form. Above all, Olive Zakharov was an outstanding humanitarian. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would almost feel that Olive Zakharov, because of the diversity of those issues she pursued, the vigour with which she pursued them and the way in which she applied herself so fully to those issues, was motivated by a belief that there was so much to do and so little time to do it. Even on the day she met with that terrible accident, as has been pointed out by others, she was involved in pursuing things quickly, getting things done and maximising the amount that she could do with the time available to her. To a very large extent, that probably accounts for that disastrous accident. </PARA>

Her activities in rural areas, in attending functions and in supporting community groups are legendary in the Victorian branch of the ALP. I know that on one occasion, as a candidate, I was in the electorate for the entire day.

I would like to extend my sympathies to the family, particularly to the kids, Robin, Jeannie and Martin; and to her sister Ethel.

What is now an organisation with about 40,000 members and $100 million or so in deposits started literally in a lounge room with a shoe box and a few members who saw this as a way of achieving some financial equality for people who did not have power in the financial system. Olive was one of those very early founders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within our own party, it is worth noting that in Victoria in 1990 when we lost the nine federal seats and were decimated in terms of resources to reach people who were wanting to reach us, Olive took on an enormous workload&mdash;an incredible workload of simply getting in a car and travelling around rural Victoria. To this day I still do not understand how she did it. But she did it. To a large extent I think her performance in the last election from the third position on the Senate ticket is reflective of the personal support that she developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like briefly to tell a little tale of the one time that she chastised me. I think the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) will remember the time when my behaviour was not something of which I am proud. I became frustrated in a joint committee meeting when some senators from the other place were with us and I said some things that perhaps I should not have said. To ease tensions I left the meeting. Olive followed me out and said, `You know, I might agree with what you said, but I certainly do not agree with the way you said it, and I think you should ring up those people and apologise.' I said, `Olive, you must be out of your mind. I'm not going to ring them up and apologise.' Anyway, I went back to my office and I got a phone call from Olive who said, `I think you should reconsider this,' and just left it at that. A couple of days later I met her at the airport and she said, `Have you?' I said, `Yes, Olive,' and she said, `Oh, good.' I considered myself to have been gently chastised by Olive and I am proud to have been so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not think of these things very much in this context, but it is now very clear that there are many people who will remember their association with Olive with pride. We trust that knowing this will help her family through this very difficult time. </PARA>

These were experiences similar to those that influenced my predecessor as the member for Scullin, my father, who has great admiration and respect for Olive. </PARA>

In the debates that took place, particularly the debate on Coronation Hill, Olive never lost sight of her objective to protect the cultural and natural heritage values of Kakadu National Park or, even though it was not her electorate, to represent the interests, as she saw them, of the traditional owners of that park and of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people more generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to return to my contribution on the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994 which I was speaking on last night prior to the adjournment. As honourable members will recall, I was outlining the interesting history which I believe starkly contrasts the opposition's view on land for Aboriginal people with what this government has been able to do. I remind the House that the land fund bill has been described as an act of good faith with Aboriginal people. I have to say that I believe the opposition's debate on the previous bill and on this bill, and the Senate machinations, have been acts of bad faith.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to read from the publication circulated by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) so people can understand what we are aiming to achieve. Page 1 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Native Title Act secured for those indigenous Australians who could establish a continuous association with their traditional lands the right to recover that land. However, most Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders cannot establish that association in the face of European encroachment on their lands and their culture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation now produced by the Government offers those indigenous people the opportunity, continuing indefinitely, to reclaim at least part of their cultural heritage by regaining control over land.</PARA>
<PARA>The arguments we have heard in this debate once again illustrate the continuing lack of understanding about the issues involved. Indeed, the amendments that the opposition is still talking about really indicate its lack of understanding about what is important to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the 67 amendments that the Senate made to the old bill involve issues that have been rejected by most spokespeople for Aboriginal people in this country. For instance, attempting to decide who is most severely dispossessed and making grants of money available to individuals as well as corporations are absolutely outside what would be appropriate, as Aboriginal people have told us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that there are individuals and groups of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country who may have put a different view, who may not be entirely happy with the first bill, but the vast majority have indicated, and indeed did indicate to the Senate select committee, their opposition to the amendments. It is disappointing that the opposition is continuing to hold onto these amendments. There is very clear evidence from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) that he intends to allow the bill to pass both houses of the parliament, purely because he does not wish it to become the trigger for a double dissolution, and he has clearly signalled that he will reinstitute those amendments. He does not have the courage of his convictions to oppose the bill because he knows that he would then have to face the political consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my earlier remarks I referred to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 6 March by Mark Baker. I would like to mention that further. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In shelving rather than dumping the Coalition's objections to the land fund, he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has also avoided the damaging partyroom brawl that would be provoked by any attempted policy change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in walking away from an issue on which the Coalition fought so hard for so long, Mr Howard risks being seen as afraid to face down the Government and unwilling to fight for what he believes in.</PARA>
<PARA>That is going to be a very telling issue. I was personally very concerned and very angry about the opposition leader's comment about the guilt industry in his speech on the second reading. On 2 March, he said in this House:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the debate on Aboriginal affairs from now on will focus on policies and measures that improve the dignity, the independence, the lifestyle, the health, the education, the employment prospects and the family stability of Australia's Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are issues that nobody would argue about. However, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It ought not to be distracted by arguments as to who is more compassionate. It ought not to be distracted by challengeable concepts of intergenerational guilt. Of course injustices were done to the original people, but those injustices were not committed by current generations of Australians and, so far as I am concerned, I am not going to be a party to the guilt industry . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is huge hypocrisy. For the alternative leader of the government of this country to stand up and wave away the collective responsibility that all Australians have to the dispossession is one of the key issues that contrasts the present government and those who would aspire to sit on the government benches. I found his comments totally objectionable, and I believe that others will too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His comments are in stark contrast with those of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who in all his speeches has made it very clear that we have a collective responsibility. We are responsible for dispossession, and we have to face up to those responsibilities. He has made this clear in all his speeches. In the second reading debate on the first bill, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the first time in our history, the inherent rights of indigenous Australians have been recognised and given statutory protection. These developments indicate that as a nation we have had the collective courage and wisdom to acknowledge the violence and destruction done to indigenous Australians and their culture since European occupation. They signal that as a nation we are willing to accept our responsibility to work towards a new relationship.</PARA>
<PARA>The comments the Prime Minister made in his second reading speech on this bill, and those he has put on the public record on a number of occasions, contrast clearly with the position of the opposition leader. The country will judge who has the moral integrity on this matter, and it will certainly have the support of indigenous Australians and the wider Australian community. I commend this revised land fund bill to the House. </PARA>

There is a wide ranging display of attitude and caring. We do not all agree on everything, but it is not the case that the government members are the repository of all wisdom on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs.

She criticised the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) for making the point that he would not become part of the guilt industry.

I certainly acknowledge that earlier Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were not treated properly, well, humanely or with justice. That is a fact, and nobody denies that. We have to acknowledge history, but we cannot live in the past. We have to learn from the past and go forward to the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the first version of the land fund bill was introduced towards the middle of last year. I think the second reading debate was introduced some time in the August sitting. At that time, after the bill was introduced, the opposition came up with seven amendments. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) absolutely criticised the shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), because she could not present the amendments to him before they had gone through the party mechanism. I think that criticism was totally unfair. Whether it is legislation of the government or the coalition parties&mdash;be it bills or amendments&mdash;it goes before the relevant party room first. Interestingly, the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) totally rejected the amendments out of hand before they were even public. The Prime Minister had not seen the amendments when he rejected them. He said, `There's no way that they're any good.' I do not think that is a manifestation of good government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A great deal has been said about consultation right around Australia. I think the term `exhaustive consultation' has been used. I do not know what that exhaustive consultation is. I am yet to see any report or indication of what consultation took place. I believe that the Land Council of New South Wales was not consulted. This House should recall that the largest number of Aboriginal people in Australia live in New South Wales. Indeed, a great many Aboriginal people live in my electorate of Cowper, on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. That so-called exhaustive consultation did not include consultation with a great many individuals or organisations. I know that government speakers will say, `We consulted with ATSIC, which is the representative of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.' That is the theory, but we should remember that only 31 or 32 per cent of the Aboriginal community who were entitled to vote in the ATSIC elections actually voted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true to say that urban Aboriginals feel cheated by this present Labor government. They were excluded from any benefit from Mabo and now, basically, they are excluded from the indigenous land fund. I do not think that is the way to go. I think they are quite right to feel cheated. I know that a stage 3 has been talked about. We have had Mabo and now the indigenous land fund. Stage 3 will be the social justice package. We do not know yet what will be in that package. I hope that it represents some justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Although there has been no mention of it, I wonder whether there is going to be a stage 4&mdash;or even a stage 5. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether stage 4 is not an extension of some form of legislative apparatus to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people control of all the seas of Australia, including the marine resources within the seas. I know that in the Northern Territory there is a claim on the Timor Sea which even goes beyond Australia's territorial waters. This is something of which all Australians&mdash;Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal&mdash;should be aware. If there is any move along these lines the government should come clean and tell all the people of Australia just what is in line down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the benefit of the indigenous land fund to the people of the Torres Strait? If the land fund is there to buy land for people who cannot establish a native title claim, what is the situation with the people in the Torres Strait? How are those people going to benefit? What benefit does Getano Lui, George Mye, Flo Kennedy, the Mosbys or any of the people who live on those wonderful islands in the Torres Strait gain? The islands are there and the people have the islands. No more islands are going to suddenly appear out of the sea that those people can go and buy with the assistance of the indigenous land fund. The minister should tell the parliament and the people of the Torres Strait how they will benefit from the indigenous land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the closing minutes of her speech the honourable member for Capricornia accused us on this side of the House of a lack of understanding. I think she may have been quoting something; if so, she was endorsing the statement that the people of the Torres Strait cannot establish traditional links with land that they may have been associated with. I am sorry she is not here because that is so absurd; it is a nonsense. I have been on Thursday, Darnley, York, Murray, Badu and Prince of Wales islands. It is wrong to say that the people of the Torres Strait cannot establish traditional links. A lot of those people have moved away for jobs, because they are very hard working people, but they have not been removed from their islands. They are still there. They have not been picked up and blackbirded somewhere, as happened to some other poor people. The honourable member for Capricornia is slightly off the beam when she suggests that that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill spoke to 224 separate Aboriginal organisations by way of consultation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of our amendments to the original bill dealt with so-called individual ownership. The honourable member for Capricornia, along with other speakers, has referred to that amendment in an attempt to bucket the opposition by saying that this amendment is stupid and so on. When I first spoke on the legislation I made the point that the parliament and taxpayers of Australia make grants of money or goods to individual Australians all the time. In that amendment we were not saying that only individuals or family groups or communities should get anything out of the indigenous land fund. Bear in mind that the bill says that only corporations can get it. We were saying, `Yes, corporations can, but also, where appropriate, individuals, communities and family groups may also get it.' Someone else has made a point about corporations in this debate. Is a corporation so much a natural part of Aboriginal culture?

The member for Charlton and I have travelled around Australia together looking at this problem. We could not help but be appalled that in 1995 Australians are living in worse than Third World conditions. It is not just happening in the outback. There is a popular conception that these conditions exist only in the Kimberleys or the Pitjantjatjara lands.

But that is not the only area experiencing problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very fortunate to spend a few days in the Torres Strait in January. I visited Thursday Island, Darnley Island and Murray Island.

Jim was the chairman of the local Aboriginal community in Armidale which had dreadful houses, made of corrugated iron, with no lining.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jim, his wife and some other people came and visited me in my home. I have never forgotten the point they made. The reason for their visit was that the University of New England had got my wife to conduct some drawing classes as part of an adult education activity for the Aboriginal community in Armidale. Naturally, I went to pick her up after the class and I said to them, `Come home and have a cup of tea or coffee,' as one does, and they came home with us. </PARA>

He said, `I'll tell you what: when they see me at the post office in Beardy Street they will stop and talk to me. They are very friendly.

What we have to come back to with the land fund is the realisation that employment, health, education and housing are vital things. Basically, the Aboriginal people in my electorate have got land.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have about five minutes now of the total time available to me before my contribution to the debate on the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill will, understandably, be interrupted by question time. In response to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), when the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) adopts, as he suggests, the high moral ground&mdash;I certainly would not  describe it that way; I would describe it as a position of conscience&mdash;and when she criticises some members of the opposition, let me assure the member for Cowper that she does not include him. Nor would I. The member for Aston (Mr Nugent), for example, would not be included by us when we criticise some of the member for Cowper's colleagues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also hope that the member for Cowper in his party room consideration of these questions would be a little less fulsome in his support for the attitude which has been adopted by many of his colleagues and by the attitude and the role which has been adopted by the opposition generally, both here and in the Senate, in connection with this legislation. I believe it would have been less fulsome than the support he understandably makes available for the position which the opposition adopts when he debates the question in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind, the performance of the opposition parties generally, including the two Greens in the Senate, in relation to this legislation has been one of the most shameful examples of the numerous attempts which have been made from time to time by opposition parties, opposition spokesmen and opposition activists to sabotage major political initiatives in the advancement of Australia's indigenous people. I believe that their approach to this question has been marked by prevarication, clearly by misrepresentation, by obfuscation, by opportunism. I think it has been a most unfortunate exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make reference to the two Green senators whose attitude and approach, I believe, has been unconscionable in relation to this question. Despite the honourable objectives which those two Green senators and the international green movement have in relation to the world environment, I believe that, as a result of their attitude to the bill which this bill is now designed to replace, those two Greens have disgraced the green movement with the hypocrisy which they have shown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noticed that the Greens in Queensland have suggested that they may not support or provide any preferences for the Goss government in the next state election because of what they refer to as the Goss government's attitude towards the environment. That is one of the reasons why I refer to their hypocrisy. I ask them: what do they think about the social environment of Aboriginal people? They use the appalling excuse that the reason they opposed the land fund bill was that it did not provide sufficient funds for the purposes for which it was being set up. But the operation of that fund and the way in which it is designed to be established will be providing, at the end of a 10-year period, almost $1.3 billion for the continuity of funding to make it possible for the Indigenous Land Corporation to have access to the financial resources which will be necessary for it to continue to acquire land in order to make that land available to Aboriginal corporations, Aboriginal groups, for uses to be determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reference has also been made to the general question of the consultation process which was adopted by both the government and the opposition. Let me remind everyone that the bill which this bill now replaces was introduced into the House of Representatives on 30 June 1994, the middle of last year. It was allowed to lie on the table to allow full examination, full consultation, full discussion, full criticism and full analysis until 30 August when the second reading took place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading took a total of almost 11 hours of debate in this chamber. The consideration in detail stage in this chamber took almost 10 hours of additional time. When it went to the Senate, the second reading stage took almost five hours and the committee stage took 22 hours and 30 minutes. It is doubtful whether or not any legislation has occupied the time of this chamber and the time of the Senate to the extent that this legislation has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of those changes that were adopted in the Senate, most of which would have had the effect of tearing the heart out of the legislation, destroying the purpose of the legislation, it was obvious that the government could adopt only one position and that was to reject the majority of those major amendments and reintroduce this legislation.

I refer the minister to cabinet's decision to wait until after the 25 March New South Wales state election to announce the government's decision on woodchipping in that state. The federal government has claimed that the ostensible reason for the delay is that New South Wales forestry information needs to be re-examined, even though it accepted the New South Wales evaluation process some two weeks ago. Given this acceptance, is it not a fact that New South Wales information is as good as that provided by Victoria and Tasmania&mdash;two states in which the coupes to be logged have already been announced?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there are any legal proceedings pending, I will certainly not canvass them in any answer I give on this matter. Yesterday the honourable member for Barker, together with the honourable member for Hindmarsh, asked a series of questions in the House the substance of which dealt with the secure holding of confidential information which was attached to the so-called Fergie report, which related to the Hindmarsh Island bridge case before the Federal Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The express statement of the honourable member was that these documents were held in a most haphazard manner and were but flotsam circulating around Australia in such a way that they found their way to the honourable member for Barker's control. Given that the documents were held by the Australian Government Solicitor in Adelaide and given that that office was responsible for the dispatch of the documents to this parliament and to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I certainly did make inquiries about the security that was in place to make sure the documents were given the respect they deserved, to find out how it could be that the documents ended up in the hands of the honourable member for Barker, and to find out the sequence of events that followed that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been advised that the documents were given to the office of the Australian Government Solicitor in Adelaide some time before December last year, during the preparation of the Hindmarsh Island case. That case concluded in December and on 4 January this year the documents were dispatched by way of courier to this House. I should explain that there was not simply one solitary document or a small group of documents, which may have been the impression one got when listening to the honourable member yesterday. In fact, a very large body of documents was forwarded back to the House in a large cardboard box.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The documents about which the question was raised yesterday were sealed in a brown envelope. This envelope was marked `Confidential&mdash;Appendices 2 and 3, to be read only by women'. The envelope was then placed in a larger outer white document. This was sealed with sticky tape and was placed in a larger box, together with the balance of these documents. This box was secured. It was then labelled twice, the first label being the Ansett Air Freight label, which directed the parcel to the minister for ATSIC, with the minister's suite number given and a contact name, Sean McLaughlin. There was a second label, a white AGS label, on the box and it was directed to the office of the minister for aboriginal affairs, again giving the minister's suite number. The box was then marked `Strictly Confidential, only to be opened by Sean McLaughlin'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I table for the benefit of the House a statutory declaration by Mary Theresa Milaris, an administrative officer with the office of the AGS in Adelaide, which attests to the circumstances of the dispatch of the documents. The box was then delivered to Parliament House on 6 January. It would appear that after it arrived at the House's loading dock it was incorrectly labelled by the dock staff, `To the member for Barker, care of the ministerial wing.' The box was then delivered to the member for Barker's office on 6 January.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, lo and behold on 2 February this year the solicitors acting for the applicants in the Hindmarsh Island bridge case filed a new application for further and better particulars, asking for a deferral of the delivery of the judgment. At that stage the case had been completed, it had been heard, but judgment had not been delivered. When the application was made on 2 February it was supported by affidavits deposed by the solicitors acting for the applicants. Attached to those affidavits were documents which could have their source only from the box of documents which arrived in the honourable member's office. They were available from only three sources: one was the Australian Government Solicitor's office in Adelaide; one was the office of the minister for Aboriginal affairs; and one was the honourable member's office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remarkably, although at that time it obviously led to some alarm that there had been a breach of security at the Australian Government Solicitor's office since it was not known where these documents could have been sourced from, yesterday the honourable member revealed by his actions where the documents did in fact come from. He attempted to table one part of the documents in the House yesterday. The Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, reporting on yesterday's events in its edition today, revealed that in February some hundreds of documents were supplied anonymously to a handful of South Australian politicians and journalists, including from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that is, after the box had found its way to the office of the honourable member for Barker, the same member who apparently told the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement that he made many copies of the documents.

<PARA>It is very unusual for this House to be asked to direct its mind to the censure of a private member but these are most extraordinary and unusual circumstances.

The label on the box itself was marked that the box contained strictly confidential documents and that it was not to be opened by anyone other than the Mr McLaughlin from the minister's office, not the member for Barker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Barker misled the House yesterday in stating that the documents were in an unsealed envelope, the sort freely available anywhere you like. Not only were the particular documents not in an unsealed envelope but also they were in two envelopes. The outer envelope was very firmly secured and taped up, and the inner envelope was very clearly marked that the material was confidential and not to be read other than by women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it was clearly marked, and then this second envelope itself was placed in another box containing the rest of the documents, and that box itself was sealed securely. So, far from being a sort of scatter-gun approach&mdash;could not care less about whether the documents were held securely or not&mdash;they were very securely held, they were properly protected, and they were then assigned to a courier who correctly directed them to this parliament house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then a mistake occurred. Okay, we all know that these mistakes can occur, that mail is sometimes wrongly directed. Even though it was labelled twice on the box to go to the minister's office, I suppose we cannot blame anyone for the fact that it ended up in the honourable member's office. But that is when it really starts to happen. What happens when it comes to the member's office? Do his staff open it up and realise that it is obviously not for them, that it has a clear letter from the government solicitor in there returning the material back to the minister, stating what the material is? Does the office of the member come to the conclusion, `Oh well, this isn't for us. We have to return it back to the minister?' They eventually do that&mdash;but they do not do it on the day that they get the documents, they do not do it the day after they get the documents, and they do not do it the day after that. They do it three days afterwards!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, they were beavering over the old photocopier, getting through the whole lot, photocopying this pile of documents that high, going through every individual one. And then they came, of course, to the envelopes that were sealed. Did they say, `Well okay, we don't know what's in this?' They opened up the first envelope&mdash;and you can understand that, since they were going to photocopy everything they could get their hands on. But then they came to the next envelope and that is very clearly marked `Strictly confidential. Appendices to the report, to be read by women only'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do they have a skerrick of regard for this? And understand that this is the office of the member whose electorate covers the Hindmarsh Bridge area. It is not like it has gone to some member who knows nothing of the background, does not know the importance of what is going on, has not heard a skerrick about the argument concerning this confidential material. This is not some novice off the street who knows nothing about it. This is the member who came into this House last year and tried to move disallowance motions on the minister's actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the member who has campaigned, in his own words, long and hard on this issue. Him and his staff know all about this matter. They know exactly what they have got their hands on. It is no wonder they sit on it for days, no wonder they photocopy everything they can lay their hands on, and no wonder they disregard the warnings that are on that envelope and they photocopy it. They do not care about this. They do not care about the sensitivities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then it gets worse than that&mdash;even worse! Then they say, `Oh well, you beauty, this is Christmas. Some documents have fallen off the old back of the truck. We'll make what use of them we can.' But the honourable member does not try to confine himself to some sort of political advantage&mdash;we cannot be all too pious about that; we know what the facts of life are. But he does not confine himself to trying to get a political advantage in terms of these documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suddenly, the documents start appearing all over South Australia. They appear in the office of the Adelaide<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Advertiser</EMPHASIS>. They appear in the offices of a handful of South Australian politicians. And, remarkably and incredibly enough, and to your great shame, Mr McLachlan, they end up in the hands of the solicitors that are acting against the Commonwealth. So this is not just this thing of trying to get political advantage for their own ends. This is a case where the interests of this Commonwealth in a court of law are undermined by the actions of this member and his office. So that is amazing behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to give him credit for gall and having a hide thicker than old Jessie the elephant, haven't you? Not only does he do that&mdash;not only does the thing circulate around the place, not only is it then used in a court to try to open proceedings and get a judgment altered; they are not the only consequences of him stumbling upon these documents&mdash;he has to come into this House and think he can go one better: squeeze a little bit more out of it, get a bit more political advantage for himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the honourable member for Barker goes for this stunt of tabling the document, trying to make out that the documents were not held in a secure manner when he knows full well exactly the circumstances in which those documents came into his possession. He knows what security was in place, of how the documents were housed in that particular box, of how they were directed and of how, by mistake, they happened to turn up in his office. He knows all the facts about that, but he simply ignores that and goes for a few more cheap political points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely appalling and outrageous behaviour. Not only does it show complete disregard for Aboriginal women, not only does it show that he has no compunction about misleading the House, as he did through the impression he gave yesterday; what does this say about the entire opposition approach to this? We know that this comes on the top of a whole new strategy, a whole new slant that the opposition has gone with. Last week we heard how the Liberal Party is pioneering in this country the technique of push polling. We know how Mr Textor and Mr Robb have been introducing Mr Textor. We know how the Leader of the Opposition squirmed and tried to get himself out of that. Honest John Howard stands for push polling. Honest John Howard, who stands behind his shadow minister, sees nothing wrong with the conduct of his shadow minister. He thinks it is perfectly fine for his shadow minister to copy documents, to circulate them wherever he wants and to get any sort of political advantage he can while not caring when they end up in the hands of people acting against the Commonwealth in legal proceedings. This is the stance that so-called honest John Howard has taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the honourable member for Barker, do honourable members remember how he came to this House? He came from the National Farmers Federation. He was going to be the great white hope. We have seen a few of them come and go. He was going to be the latest of the great white hopes of the Liberal Party. When he came in he had a disdain for politics. When he was the leader of the National Farmers Federation I remember that he made a statement saying that he could not abide politicians, the way they used to compromise and the way they used to get down and use grubby tactics. Well, honourable member, you have learned pretty well, haven't you? You have learned all the tricks but you have taken it to new lows. You don't care what you do, you don't care who you offend and you don't care what you do with the documents you get your hands on so long as you can get some grubby political advantage out of it. This would have to be the most tawdry affair that we have ever seen. We will see a lot more of it because this is the tactic of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has absolutely no policy. What has he stood for since he has been Leader of the Opposition?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remarkable thing about the Leader of the Opposition is that he is always a man of principle and ideas when he is not the opposition leader. When he was sniping away against Andrew Peacock he had plenty of ideas on how we should shape the family, but once he got to be leader he fell into the same pattern he is starting to adopt now&mdash;that is, don't advance any particular policy position, avoid any sort of controversy, back down on the old land fund: `We don't want a double dissolution trigger; let's get away from that. Back down in terms of our opposition to the migration legislation; we don't want to give the government any cause there.' He completely avoids any policy. But the one thing which has been consistent about his approach throughout his entire period as Leader of the Opposition is that he embarks on the same sorts of sleazy tactics time and time again. We had push polling, and now we have the shadow minister using the same sorts of tactics. That is the most outrageous behaviour one could conceive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see what sorts of documents were circulated. Not only particular sensitive documents but also their confidentiality&mdash;which was completely ignored by their being photocopied and apparently circulated widely&mdash;were the subject of questions yesterday. They had no compunction about circulating widely other confidential material. For instance, on the affidavits that were subsequently filed in the Federal Court we have not only various correspondence, which I suppose is fair enough, but also individual file notes written by the minister's adviser to the minister. That shows absolutely no regard for the propriety of this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not care. You show absolutely no shame about it. You do not even have the decency to blush about it, do you? You think it is all good politics. He was asked on the various radio programs this morning, `Mr McLachlan, do you have any pangs of conscience about this?' He replied, `No, no pangs at all. It's perfectly acceptable. I am in the game of playing politics.' Then he tried to come up with some excuses about the whole thing such as, `It was most unsecure when it was delivered to my office'&mdash;and we know that that is not the case. Then he said, `I did make a copy of it, but I only made one.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, last night when he was talking to the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement about this particular behaviour, he was asked, `Did you copy the documents?' He said, `Absolutely. Of course I copied them.' He was then asked, `How many documents did you copy?' He said, `I copied them many times.' The member took great exception to this. He said that it was a lie and that either I or the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement was saying that he said that he had copied the documents many times. I would like to read briefly from a statutory declaration, which has been signed by Sandra Dorothy Saunders. She states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. During the evening of the 6th day of March 1995 at Adelaide, I had a conversation by telephone with the Honourable Ian McLachlan MHR.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The conversation related to a statement that he had made in Parliament on the 6th day of March 1995, to the effect that he had in his possession a copy of the secret attachments to the Fergie Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Mr McLachlan informed me, in the course of our telephone conversation that his office workers had copied "in the normal course of events",&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is an everyday occurrence for this member&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a large number of other confidential documents of the Minister of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs that related to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge litigation. He referred to the Government having done similar things to the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. In the course of the conversation I asked Mr McLachlan "did you take copies of all the documents?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His answer was "absolutely".</PARA>
<PARA>`Absolutely, of course I would. I do not care about their sensitivity. I do not care about their impact on Aboriginal women. Absolutely, I took it.' The declaration goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. I further asked him whether he took copies of the secret envelopes, and his answer was "yes".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. I asked him how many copies he had taken. He said "many".</PARA>
<PARA>So when he gets doorstopped by the journalists and asked, `How many copies did you take?' he says&mdash;not `many'&mdash;`One.' That is the same sort of truth which we saw yesterday with the little stunt he pulled. There is absolutely no truth in it. Ms Saunders continued in her declaration:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. I asked Mr McLachlan to return all of the copies that he had taken. I informed him that he had no right to copy the information. He responded to me by saying that there was nothing wrong with this.</PARA>
<PARA>Last night, Mr McLachlan also received a formal request from the Australian Government Solicitor to return the documents which he had received wrongly and which had been a terrible breach of confidence. He received that letter but responded by saying, `I've no intention at this stage of returning them. Advise me as to why in the world this would be a breach of confidence; why in the world this might be a breach of privilege; why in the world this could possibly be a contempt of court.' Having been caught out with his grubby shenanigans, caught out because of his own stupidity yesterday and his own greed in trying to gain a bit more political advantage, he still does not have the decency to return the documents&mdash;despite a formal request from the Australian Government Solicitor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some important questions that the honourable member better answer when he responds to this censure motion. Firstly, he has to explain how it is that he or his office found it appropriate to photocopy every document that came to him when it was perfectly clear that the documents were not directed to him. He then has to answer why he completely disregarded the advice on the envelope which contained the material which was so sensitive to Aboriginal women. He and his entire staff knew about the entire background of the matter and the impact that it would have on Aboriginal women. Why did he completely disregard that advice? Why did he hold on to the documents rather than returning them immediately to the minister? How is it that these same documents have ended up in the hands of politicians, journalists and the applicants in the litigation against the Commonwealth? How does he explain his coming to this House yesterday asking the questions that he asked and giving the impression that he gave of the behaviour of the minister for Aboriginal affairs when he himself, as a member of this House, was culpable of the most gross dereliction of duty? This member deserves to be censured by this House. </PARA>

In other words, `If I make a declaration and do what you want me to do in two days time, will you'&mdash;ATSIC&mdash;`cover my costs if I do something unlawful?' I am sure you will not like that because, when your office gave him advice on that very matter, you gave him three or four different lots of advice over a series of days.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During question time yesterday I was asked a series of questions in tandem by the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), with the endorsement of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), relating to my declaration under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to protect an important women's site near Hindmarsh Island in South Australia. During those proceedings the member for Barker claimed he had a copy of confidential appendices to a document known as the Fergie report, which in turn was attached to a report to me under the act by Professor Cheryl Saunders AO, the Director of the Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies at Melbourne University.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Barker asked me yesterday why I had allowed this confidential women's material:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to be sent around Australia like flotsam in a wreck, in unregistered parcels, the copies of the letters in an unsealed envelope, addressed to a white Australian male by the name of McLaughlin.</PARA>
<PARA>I begin my contribution to this censure motion by saying categorically on the record that the assertions made by the member for Barker are utterly without foundation, as what I will say to the parliament will make clear. I will conclusively show that the member for Barker has deliberately misled this parliament and, outside the parliament, has misled the media and the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances under which the member for Barker has received and made use of this material will be seen, I believe, by history to be one of the darkest chapters in the ethics, morality and honesty of this parliament and in Australian public life. They are circumstances which render the member for Barker unfit to serve as an opposition shadow minister in the federal parliament. It calls for decisive action by the Leader of the Opposition to remove him from his position forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been advised by a female member of my staff that she has confirmed that the confidential material referred to by the opposition yesterday in the parliament, and later received by her last night from the office of the member for Hindmarsh, was in fact the copy of secret and sacred material to be read by women only and, as indicated by Professor Saunders in her report to me, it concerned the deeply held spiritual beliefs of Aboriginal women in relation to an area involving the site of the proposed region in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was material which at all times had been accorded the highest level of protection within my office and which has been seen and read only by Ms Kee with the authority of the women concerned. At the news conference after question time yesterday the member for Barker revealed that the confidential material was part of a bigger package of material which had been received at his Parliament House office despite being addressed to my senior adviser, Mr Sean McLaughlin. The accompanying material includes most of that material. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me make it perfectly clear and let there be no mistake about what I am saying. The member for Barker said in one answer yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The documents came into my office&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he said of himself&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">because they were addressed to someone else.</PARA>

<PARA>That is who this parcel was addressed to in the first instance. Let me explain to the House in clear, unambiguous terms who sent the material, how it was sent and what in fact happened to it after it reached the member for Barker. In addition to it being addressed, as the member for Barker concedes, to a senior adviser, the material included a covering letter dated 4 January on the letterhead of the Australian Government Solicitor in Adelaide. I made that letter public yesterday. The letter was marked to the attention of Ms Sue Kee in my office and explained that it was enclosing materials relating to the Federal Court hearing concerning the Hindmarsh Island declaration. </PARA>

Mr McLaughlin advised the Australian Government Solicitor's office to send the material to my office for Ms Kee to collect on her return.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by the Australian Government Solicitor's office in Adelaide that this material was despatched by them by Ansett Air Freight first-class overnight express on 4 January 1995, addressed to `Minister for ATSIC, Suite MF17 Parliament House, Canberra', and that the box of material recorded Sean McLaughlin, my senior adviser, as the contact name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The confidential material was contained in its original form, which was to be read by women only and which in turn had been placed by the office of the Australian Government Solicitor into a second envelope which was sealed. I am prepared to table today a copy of the letter from the Australian Government Solicitor that I released yesterday. I understand the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has already tabled today's letter from the Australian Government Solicitor confirming the facts of the materials despatch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say as a parliamentarian that members can judge for themselves how this documented information was sent to my office. They can judge on the statement of the Australian Government Solicitor, with a false claim by the member for Barker, that the material was sent by me around Australia like flotsam in a wreck and was unsealed. I stress again that it was not even my office which despatched the material but the office of the Australian Government Solicitor in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Barker claimed in a news release issued by him last night that the letter of 4 January from the office of the Australian Government Solicitor had never been sighted or copied to his office. He accused me of `cooking up' this defence. Is the member for Barker seriously accusing me of fabricating a letter from the Australian Government Solicitor? If the letter from the Australian Government Solicitor was not included in the material received by the member for Barker&mdash;come in, sucker&mdash;how did he know, as he said in his news conference yesterday, and all the people up here heard him, that the material had been sent by `someone involved with his staff's effort in the court case in Adelaide'? That was yesterday's version. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Barker has admitted, the material was clearly not intended for him or his office. It was clearly material being returned to my office by the Australian Government Solicitor. More than most members in this place, the member for Barker and his office were aware of the full ambit of issues concerning Hindmarsh Island and the associated Aboriginal heritage concerns. It was the member for Barker who moved in this place a motion seeking the disallowance of my declaration concerning the bridge. That motion was rejected by this House and, I might say, rejected by the Senate. As the member for Barker himself emphasised in his news conference yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you know anything about the Hindmarsh Bridge effort, you will know that Dr Deane Fergie did a report for Cheryl Saunders and attached to that report was two secret documents to do with women's business and which none of us will ever be allowed to see or read.</PARA>
<PARA>We now know differently. Notwithstanding that fact&mdash;on the member for Barker's own public admission yesterday&mdash;after receiving the material, his office `made one copy of all those documents'. That is on the public record. The media heard the member for Barker say it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me stress this point: after receiving some eight kilograms of documents, and here is most of them, and many hundreds of pages&mdash;and his office immediately realised that it was not intended for his office&mdash;on his own admission, the member for Barker said that a copy of all the material was made by his office, and he has endorsed this action. The member for Barker knew that the material was a confidential legal communication between solicitors for the Commonwealth and an Australian government minister in relation to proceedings at that time before the Federal Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those documents arrived in my office on 9 January, despite the fact, as I have indicated, that they had been dispatched by Ansett Air Freight's first-class overnight express addressed to my office on 4 January. On advice provided to me by the Speaker, following an inquiry to him, it has been ascertained that the material was delivered to the office of the member for Barker at 9.45 on 6 January. I only found out conclusively and definitively this morning where my mail spent the weekend. As the Attorney-General has made very clear in his contribution, it was in the office of the member for Barker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can now further confirm to the parliament that what the member for Barker told the media yesterday was categorically false. Not one photocopy of the documents was taken by the member for Barker, as he confessed last night, but as the Attorney-General has made clear, in referring to the statutory declaration, which I will subsequently table, if it has not already been tabled, there were many copies of the document made. The member for Barker confessed last night to the Australian legal rights movement the fact that many copies were taken by his office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can just imagine the photocopier. If a photocopier is capable of meltdown, it must have happened on that fateful weekend in the office of the member for Barker. There were some eight kilos of documents constituting many hundreds of documents that were copied on that fateful weekend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell the House what the member for Barker did with some of the documents after he got them. Ms Kee assures me that when she returned from leave and opened the box she immediately examined the contents to ensure that the confidential material was in its sealed envelope marked `To be read by women only'. This envelope was not contained in another sealed Australian Government Solicitor envelope, despite the fact that this is the condition in which the office of the Australian Government Solicitor has formally indicated that the material left Adelaide. I am prepared to table a statement by Ms Kee to confirm the condition of the documents when received by her. </PARA>

His staff photocopied the documents. There were some documents of particular sensitivity for Aboriginal women. As the member has said, he has never read those documents.

I understood the position to be that, on the basis of this material, the applicants sought a further hearing or an opening up of the case because they had more information.

Any fair political observer would have noticed that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been under a lot of political pressure from the new resurgent Leader of the Opposition. But there is another political context, and that is the dreadful failure of government policy when it comes to the affairs of our Aboriginal people. There have been some very searching questions in recent days by the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). The reality is that you people do not have any answers. When Aboriginal affairs is raised as an issue, you think that the best way to respond is by mounting a political attack on the opposition. </PARA>

Here is the letter.' He would then have had at the back of his mind the thought that, if the opposition has hold of that letter, perhaps the rest of the documents are insecure and therefore the strategies that we may pursue in relation to a court case that the Commonwealth has going are themselves insecure and that perhaps information that had been given to appropriate people by women in a most important fashion is itself also not secure. The first time the minister heard of the situation in which he found himself yesterday was as a result of your questions. If you were not trying to exploit Aboriginal people in the questioning of the minister for Aboriginal affairs yesterday, I do not know who was.

What did he discover when he opened this box addressed to the adviser of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, as his staff started to curl their way through it and photocopy every edition of it? In various interviews of who was responsible for opening and photocopying it, he describes it as, `My guy' or `My guys'.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 4 January 1995 I caused to be sent with other documents a letter, signed by Ms Arlene Macdonald Principal Solicitor on behalf of Ms Jane Nunan Senior Solicitor, to the Office of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs marked to the attention of Ms Sue Kee, a copy of which is attached hereto and marked "A".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That letter and each of the documents referred to in that letter were packed in a "bantex" cardboard box with brown masking tape around it. The letter was, to the best of my recollection, attached to one of the folders contained within the box.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among other documents in the box was a brownish envelope which was marked as containing confidential papers which I understood to be the confidential annexures to the Fergie Report. I am not sure whether that envelope was sealed or not. After Ms Mcdonald had checked the contents of the box against the list contained in the letter, I put that brownish envelope&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>here we are&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">into another white AGS envelope and sealed the white envelope with sticky tape. I am not certain whether I marked the outside of the envelope or not. I packed that white envelope along one of the sides of the box.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the top of the box I placed two labels. The first was a copy of Ansett Air Freight Consignment Docket . . . which was addressed to "Minister for ATSIC, Suite MF 17 Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600" with the contact name of "Sean McLaughlin". A copy of this label as attached hereto and marked "B".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second was a white AGS adhesive label addressed to "Office of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Suite MF 17, Parliament House Canberra ACT, Attention Mr Sean McLaughlin". Both labels were visible and did not overlap one with the other.</PARA>
<PARA>What is absolutely clear from that is that you got not a fax suggesting to you that the opposition ought to be up lying away on budget matters&mdash;you did not get a single fax from that&mdash;but a sealed envelope, sealed boxes. You got correctly labelled and addressed boxes, and you chose to spend all weekend copying what was in those boxes before then sending them on to the office of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs without the courtesy of an indication that they had been opened in error. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason you did not indicate they had been opened is very obvious. The reason you chose not to put on the box sent back to the minister's office that you had opened it in error was because of what you intended to do with it subsequently. At different points in time the honourable member for Barker has said to various people, `I have tossed thousands of these things around the place.' At other times in this place, in contradiction&mdash;that is, lying&mdash;he has said, `Oh no, only one copy of all of these was made; I did not read at least the sensitive one. That was all that was done. But somehow, miraculously, all these documents turned up elsewhere.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there was an indication that in fact the honourable member is the source of these documents allegedly turning up all over the country it was the fact that his office chose not to inform the office of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs that the box had been opened in error, that they had better be on notice that there was a possibility that the Aboriginal women's evidence had been seen by the wrong people in the business and that all the documentation related to the court case had been seen by others. If ever there was an indication that he and he alone was responsible for that it is in that single act of failing to inform the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs that that had been opened in error. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And what happened subsequently? What happened subsequently was that these documents ended up with one side in the court case. The documents ended up in Adelaide with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>. They ended up with a variety of other members of parliament, all unexplained. But the second piece of stupidity by these prevaricating, dishonest people opposite was that they did not go to Adelaide to post the things from Adelaide. These deceivers are inept and stupid, and they are also incompetent. These inept, stupid deceivers actually sent the documents out anonymously for the delectation of all and sundry, just as they tried to get out the leaked documents related to the Department of Finance's consideration of the budget&mdash;`Oh, do come down, members of the Press Gallery, and have a look at this document for us, but for God's sake don't tell anybody where it came from; just out of the goodness of our hearts we give them to you.' But they were tumbled by one decent member of the Press Gallery, a journalist from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. In this case they were tumbled by their own stupidity because the documents ended up in Adelaide from Canberra. So the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> said, `Well, we got the documents all right, but they came from some address in Canberra'&mdash;and not from the AGS office in Adelaide you have been trying all over the place to blame. The documents turned up from Canberra, from the only possible source. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is the guilty culprit in all of this.

Quite the opposite is the case; the honourable member for Barker protected them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any speech in the censure motion, the government has totally failed to substantiate charges against the member for Barker. The first count, if we were to accept it in those terms, is for misleading the House on the source of the sensitive documents. The source of the sensitive documents is the minister, and the minister alone. The second aspect of the censure motion is that the member for Barker used the documents in a way which breached the integrity of proceedings before the Federal Court. We have a very rare admission from the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs that he did not disclose all of the documents during that Federal Court hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has not claimed privilege for those documents, so how can you now say that, apart from the sensitive letters, those other documents are so secret and so important to national security that they should never be released by the member for Barker? You did not claim privilege in a court of law for those documents. Rather, you did not make them available for discovery. I am quite sure that the proceedings of the Federal Court will take this matter further and that it will be very interested to know why the minister now stands angry before the legislature because some documents are circulating the community that he previously had not made available for discovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an incompetent minister. On any criteria, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is quite incompetent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a problem: it cannot send in the Federal Police to harangue the member for Barker and seize the documents, as it tried with the leaked budget submission documents of some weeks ago. Instead, the government is trying to use the forms of this place and its numbers to trump up some charges and carry a censure motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt about the government: it will do only what it thinks is in its own political interest. What hypocrisy by the government in trying to appeal to some higher notion of conduct in public life. Fancy government members trying to lecture anybody, let alone the opposition, about the ethics of parliamentary behaviour. They have only the most base political motives. They will exploit every possible situation to their own perceived political benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has no morals and no standing in the community. There are a great many issues that we want to pursue, and you take up the time of the parliament with patently trumped up charges that are only designed to attack the member for Barker in a very personal sense. You will always individually and personally attack members of the Liberal and National parties. You know no other practice of politics. You will never debate issues and policies on their merits. You will always attack individuals. That is how you operate outside of the parliament, and that is quite obviously how you operate inside this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This censure motion is a joke. You have not, apart from all of the generalisations and all of the contrived outrage, landed a single punch on the member for Barker. You have not in any way established that the member for Barker has committed any misdemeanour, let alone an indictable offence. Quite the opposite: the member for Barker is perfectly entitled to deal with those documents as he sees fit&mdash;apart from the sensitive letters. You will have to answer why those documents were not discoverable in the Federal Court. If they are so privileged, why did you not claim that privilege in the Federal Court? The member for Barker enjoys the respect and support of the federal National and Liberal parties. Nothing you do in this parliament by way of trumped up charges will diminish his standing. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is absolutely right, Mr Speaker; it has been for years. As I was saying, the disregard for the cross-media rules was shown in the comments of the shadow Treasurer as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald Sun</EMPHASIS> on 18 February when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cross-media ownership rules are designed, I think, to make media owners cross, but having little other discernible effect.</PARA>
<PARA>That demonstrates what the opposition thinks about the cross-media rules. Essentially, what we seem to be seeing from the opposition is that it would rely on the Trade Practices Act as being sufficient to ensure that we had plurality and diversity of media ownership&mdash;in particular to deal with the possibility of Mr Packer owning Fairfax as well as Channel 9.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning on ABC radio the shadow Treasurer was interviewed and he was asked this direct question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would you allow Mr Packer to own both Fairfax and Channel 9?</PARA>
<PARA>He responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look, what we have always said is we want strong anti-monopolistic laws run by the Trade Practices Commission and we have always been opposed to market monopolisation&mdash;always, always.</PARA>
<PARA>The journalist, Cathy Job, asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would that be a market monopolisation?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Alston said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, that is what you have the Trade Practices Commission there for.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on with a bit of a diatribe against the Prime Minister. Then he came back and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You give it to independent people and you let them make the decisions. That has always been our policy and it always will be.</PARA>
<PARA>When asked, `Would you allow Mr Packer to own both Fairfax and Channel 9?', the shadow Treasurer is clearly saying, `We would rely on the Trade Practices Act.' In that context, it is interesting to see what the chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, Professor Fels, has said about this issue. He has already said that the Trade Practices Act would not be likely to prohibit Mr Packer controlling both Fairfax and Channel 9. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 18 February, in an article headed `Control bid for newspapers "too big a risk for democracy"', states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, Professor Alan Fels, said there were no real trade practices hurdles to Mr Packer controlling Fairfax. The Trade Practices Act was designed to limit concentration of ownership of any particular market, he said, but newspapers and television were regarded as separate markets, so Mr Packer would effectively be treated as a new player in the newspaper market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Generally speaking, the history of TPC laws has been that television and newspapers have been regarded as being separate markets," Mr Fels said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Accordingly, there is a reasonable likelihood he would be regarded as a new entrant to the newspaper market."</PARA>
<PARA>What is clearly being said there by the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission is that TV and newspapers are separate markets. Tests of concentration of ownership under the Trade Practices Act would address these markets separately, so there is no real trade practices hurdle to Packer controlling Fairfax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the shadow Treasurer is asked the direct question, `Would you allow Mr Packer to own both Fairfax and Channel 9?', he says, `That's for the Trade Practices Commission to decide.' But what he is really saying is yes, because that is what the Trade Practices Commission chairman has already said would be likely to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the opposition has a policy of allowing Mr Packer to own both Channel 9 and Fairfax, and that has been the hidden message so far. It has not been said explicitly but it comes through quite clearly when you look at what Professor Fels has said and when you take away the fig leaf of the Trade Practices Commission&mdash;which is what it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is being held there to say, `Yes, we'd go through the proper process. We'd have the Trade Practices Commission. We wouldn't allow any sort of deal to be done. We'd go through an independent process.' But the chairman of that independent process has already said that that would most likely result in Packer being allowed to own Fairfax as well as Channel 9.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, we clearly have an opposition which has now made it quite clear to the Australian public that its policy is to allow Mr Packer to own Channel 9 and Fairfax.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But we were very concerned before the end of last year that we had seen very considerable increases in what was clearly hoarding. People, when they approached the November-December period when the safety net issue was raised, were going in and getting repeat prescriptions more frequently than was necessary for their illnesses. They were hoarding those medicines because they wanted to save money and, as a result, had material in their cupboards that often would degrade and therefore would not be useful for the illness or disease that they had. It also posed a substantial risk to other members of families, particularly young members who might be able to get hold of such large quantities of medicines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure members will be aware that we introduced a so-called 20-day rule as at 1 November last year, so that the resupply period for drugs relating to those long-term illnesses was some 20 days. They were designed to last the patient a month, so there was not really any significant problems for patients. In any case, the pharmacists could override the 20-day rule if they thought it was necessary in the interests of the patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to inform members that we have already seen a very significant reduction in the cost of the PBS because of this rule and some other changes that we brought in last year. I hope all members will recognise that it has not been at the expense of patient care but rather it has reduced hoarding and the dangers associated with that. In fact, since November last year the number of prescriptions that have been dispensed is down 1.2 million prescriptions as at the same period last year. That has resulted in savings to Australian taxpayers of some $30 million just in that very short period. Not only that, it poses less of a risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to congratulate pharmacists on that achievement. They have worked very closely with government to ensure that significant saving and to reduce the danger to people hoarding medicines. I would like to say to the doctors in the community that we would like to cooperate with them, too. What we have seen, despite that very significant reduction in the number of prescriptions and in the cost to the PBS, is an increase in the cost of drugs that doctors are prescribing. Sadly, some of them are trying to pervert the process of generic substitution. So I urge them to take a leaf from the book of the pharmacists and to look after their patients and the Australian taxpayers at the same time.</PARA>

Last week the Prime Minister announced that the defenders of Darwin during the Japanese bombing in World War II and previously unrecognised Australian servicemen who took part in the Syrian campaign in World War II were to receive campaign awards for their service to Australia during World War II. Recognition of these campaigns follows recommendations from the government's committee of inquiry into defence awards which reported to my predecessor, Senator Faulkner, last year.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am sure that all honourable members agree that, in this year, the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, as we celebrate the ending of that war and victory, these two groups of Australian veterans will at last receive their due recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Syrian campaign was a short and bitter campaign against primarily the Vichy French involving predominantly Australian forces but also including British, free French and Indian troops. Most of these troops had previously served in North Africa elsewhere. However, a small proportion of the Syrian veterans did not serve west of the Suez and thus had failed to qualify for the Africa Star, despite their direct participation in the allied campaign in this part of the world. I am pleased to inform the House that, with the approval of Her Majesty the Queen and the issue of the Africa Star, these veterans will receive that long overdue recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Australians I think are now aware of the bravery shown by those in Darwin during one of the only times that our country's soil has been the subject of attack. Those stationed in Darwin lived under harsh operational field conditions&mdash;with isolation, enemy submarines and aircraft patrolling the waters into Darwin, and uncertain supply routes. They were subject to a total of 63 air raids which took place against Darwin from 19 February 1942 until 12 November 1943, and a further four against other targets in the Northern Territory, leaving a total of 261 dead and 413 injured.

My latest advice is, given the significance of these medals, a great many will be issued by Anzac Day so that those veterans concerned can proudly march with their comrades in remembering those who fought and fell 50 years ago to save this country from tyranny.</PARA>

That makes it clear that the policy position which the Leader of the Opposition advocates would result in no protection for diversity of ownership, no protection for diversity of opinion, plurality of opinion of the newspapers. That makes it clear that sole reliance by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on the Trade Practices Act would result in Mr Packer owning Channel Nine and the Fairfax Group.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member opposite says, `Where is the deal?' What I say is: how does the Leader of the Opposition explain to us the fact that in 1987 he said he supported the use of the Trade Practices Act, and today he says he relies on the Trade Practices Act, but in 1991 the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) circulated a petition that said: `We the undersigned members of this parliament oppose the sale of the Fairfax Group to any individual or consortium that would result in greater concentration of ownership'? For some reason in 1991 the Connolly petition, which the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition signed, said that they were against Fairfax being owned by Mr Packer. How is it that today they say it is okay for Mr Packer to own Fairfax? How do they justify the fact that they now think they can rely on the Trade Practices Act for Mr Packer's acquisition. It all came out of the bag this morning when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition went on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program and was asked this question:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said the Liberals are the ones who want strong and anti-monopolistic laws. But he is the person who, under the Fraser government, moved to weaken the merger provision&mdash;section 50&mdash;from dominance to a substantial lessening of competition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was the shadow Attorney-General who opposed Michael Duffy's attempts to tighten the Trade Practices Act. It is clear that, if the Leader of the Opposition had his way and we relied solely on the Trade Practices Act, Mr Packer could purchase Fairfax the next day. Is it any wonder that we have some concerns about what the opposition's view might be on this? Let us look at what Mr Howard said yesterday. The transcript of the interview states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Howard: I think it's desirable to have as much diversity as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Journalist: And would it be a lack of diversity to have ownership of a newspaper and a television station in one market?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Howard: It would depend on the size of the market and how he defined it.</PARA>
<PARA>Allan Fels says there is nothing we could do to stop Mr Packer purchasing newspapers if he owns televisions in the same market. Mr Howard yesterday was slipping and sliding. He was asked the same question five times and refused to say whether he thought it was undesirable for Mr Packer, or for anyone else for that matter, to own newspapers and television stations in the same market. Mr Costello, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, was asked the same five questions today. He was asked on five occasions whether it would be undesirable for someone, Mr Packer or otherwise&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You go back and read the transcript. On five occasions you dodged the question, `Is it undesirable for one person to own a television station and a newspaper in the same market?' It has certainly been made very clear that if the opposition had its way, by relying solely on the Trade Practices Act, it would let Mr Packer or anyone else accumulate a greater concentration of media ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this is really all about is the allegation by those opposite that in some way there is a vendetta against the Packer camp. That is the allegation the shadow spokesman, Senator Alston, makes. They claim there is a vendetta because Mr Packer made some remarks that were favourable to John Howard. It is alleged that the government now has a vendetta against Mr Packer. My response to that false allegation is to ask: how come the government stood up to Mr Packer back in November, three months before he went on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>? It was this government that said, `We will reject monopoly rights in the roll out of cable around the country.' Who was it who was prepared to support the Packer decision? Surprise, surprise; it was Senator Alston and the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The party representing free enterprise was saying that we should be giving greater consideration to franchises because, in Senator Alston's words, they have worked well in Britain and they have worked well in the United States. So your spokesman on communications said that at the very time we are introducing greater competition in aviation and telecommunications, the Liberals&mdash;the party of free enterprise&mdash;says it wants new monopoly rights to clog up competition in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, in November, it was this side of the House that stood up to Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch when they asked for closed access&mdash;controlled or managed access&mdash;for use of the cable. This government believed that it was important to have open access on the cable. If we want to get investment into the content on cable and ensure that the best of our film makers and software providers are putting together the services that will be used on cable, we must have open access. It was certainly clear that Senator Alston was saying that there should have been a longer period of exclusivity. At the same time, he was writing press releases for Mr Downer, saying there should have been a shorter period of exclusivity. But Alston is on the record as saying there should have been a longer period of exclusivity on cable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government makes clear is that we will stand by the cross-media ownership rules because we think it is important that we protect diversity of ownership. What Mr Howard is saying is that his private views are the same as his public views. What are his public views? His public views are that we should only rely on the Trade Practices Act. Allan Fels says that that means that Mr Packer or anyone else can own newspapers and television stations in the same market. What you are really saying is, `Here's the code, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to buy newspapers and television in the same market read our lips&mdash;we will only rely on the Trade Practices Act.' That is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> this morning.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, on 21 September 1994 the Leader of the National Party asked the following question of you:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I ask whether you are aware of an interruption by a member of this House to the proceedings when the Prime Minister of Ireland was speaking. For the benefit of the House, would you clarify your jurisdiction, which is jointly held with the President of the Senate, over the Great Hall of the parliament . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I was the person referred to in that question, although I was not named. I am quite happy to accept that I was&mdash;I spoke to the Prime Minister the day after. We have had a censure today of the member for Barker over a particularly sensitive issue. The question of the Leader of the National Party was based on the premise or the assumption that there was an impropriety in my action and that you may have had the ability to redress that impropriety. In the same vein, on the basis of what has happened today, I ask you to advise the House, if the member for Barker's impropriety is serious, and given that there was a censure motion against him I presume it is, and if that means that we have damaged the relationship between the federal parliament and the Aboriginal people&mdash;of course, you as the Speaker have under your jurisdiction the responsibility to uphold the dignity of the parliament; that is in the standing orders&mdash;whether what the member for Barker has done has damaged the dignity of the House and damaged the relations between this parliament and Aboriginal people and whether an apology to the Aboriginal people might be warranted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated when I made an initial contribution to this debate before further business of the House proceeded, I am pleased to have an opportunity to be involved in the debate. I am disappointed, of course, that the circumstances of that opportunity are as they have evolved. Had it not been for the fact that the coalition, in conjunction with the two Greens in the Senate, sought to sabotage this legislation, this bill, which replaces the bill that we previously sent to the Senate, would not have been necessary. I was referring to the amount of time which had been given to debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to the amendments that were proposed in that process. In the Senate, for example, 121 amendments were proposed to the legislation. At the end of the Senate's first consideration of the bill, it had agreed to 67 of them, and it had also agreed to one request for an amendment. The government accepted 21 of those amendments and all of those changes are incorporated in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let me make it perfectly clear that those people who claim that the original bill therefore was flawed are themselves in error. The essence of that bill was coherent, properly constructed and correctly designed to ensure that it would achieve the objectives which the bill was pursuing. All of those things were elements of that first bill, and they remain elements of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have very serious doubts about the genuineness of the opposition in connection with its approach to this legislation. I said the initial bill, as is this bill, is coherent in the objectives which have been set. The primary objective is to ensure that land is made available to Aboriginal people who have been most dispossessed, that is, those Aboriginal people who under the Mabo legislation have not been able to establish a continuing association with land over which they could make a legitimate claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those Aboriginal people who have been most dispossessed are those people for whom this legislation is particularly designed, and it is designed in such a way that after 10 years almost $1.3 billion will be in a fund, the income from which will generate forever into the future and provide continuing funds for the purchase of land for Aboriginal use by the Indigenous Land Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's proposal in relation to that was and is that the Indigenous Land Corporation would only be able to make that land available then to corporations themselves. That is, that in the process of building up a stock of land available to Aboriginal people for Aboriginal purposes, it would in effect be locked into the use of those Aboriginal people as a result of it being owned by corporations. If those corporations in turn sought to dispose of that land, they would have to get the permission of the Indigenous Land Corporation&mdash;an entirely appropriate procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the opposition wanted was to make provisions whereby the land from the Indigenous Land Corporation could be made available not only to corporations&mdash;which would lock it in, preferably for use by Aboriginal people into the future&mdash;but also to trusts and individuals. The interesting thing is that the opposition combined with that a provision that the trusts or the individuals could then in turn dispose of that land without any reference to the Indigenous Land Corporation and without its approval. If ever anyone wanted to attempt to sabotage the purpose of this legislation and to build into the arrangements a device which would bring the credibility of the arrangement into serious question, this is an example. I wonder about people who indicate that they have a concern for Aboriginal people and then continue to support and defend propositions of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of the proposals from the opposition was that the Indigenous Land Corporation would be required to take into account in a completely unspecified way the educational, health and similar needs of indigenous communities when deciding where to acquire land. That would unnecessarily hamstring the Indigenous Land Corporation and would lay it open to complaint all the time that any of those particular elements had not been sufficiently taken into account. In fact it would shift the whole focus of this legislation and the Indigenous Land Corporation from the provision of land, which is fundamental and central to this legislation, to other matters of concern to Aboriginals&mdash;of genuine concern, but not necessarily part of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that the opposition was proposing was that, when decisions were being made on land acquisition, the Indigenous Land Corporation should give priority to those communities that are the most severely dispossessed. That surprised even Aboriginal people. This is like the question of whether someone can be severely pregnant or partially pregnant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal people who are dispossessed are dispossessed per se. Those people who under the Mabo legislation are not able to get access to land as a result of their not being able to prove a continuing association with it&mdash;those people who historically have been most dispossessed&mdash;are the people whom this legislation was specifically designed for. But to write that into the legislation, to hamstring the Indigenous Land Corporation and to say that that corporation would have to assess relative degrees of dispossession, is absurd in the extreme. It would reduce the flexibility. As I have said, it would hamstring the Indigenous Land Corporation and lay it open to dispute, conflict, litigation and delay. For those reasons we chose not to accept those proposals by the opposition and in the process we have maintained the coherence of this legislation and ensured that it will do what the government and the Aboriginal community seek from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to a comment in connection with this from Ms Lois O'Donoghue, the Chairperson of ATSIC, in a media release on 9 February this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It is hard to understand how the Senate Select Committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the committee to which the legislation was referred by the Senate and which then reported back&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in its majority report could conclude that there was a clear level of Aboriginal support for the amendments to the Bill based on the evidence presented to the committee by Aboriginal people,"  Miss O'Donoghue said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The majority report represents another example of others knowing what is best for Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal people supported the proposal by the government and supported the principles which the government sought to enact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criticism was raised by the shadow minister, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who claimed that consultation by the government had been inadequate. She then suggested that the consultation process undertaken by the Senate select committee had been adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When making her contribution to the debate on the second reading she said that when the Senate select committee investigating the land fund bill went around Australia, it talked to, from her memory, 224 Aboriginal people. She said that those people had said, `We were not consulted.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Deputy Speaker, 224 Aboriginal people were consulted by that committee out of, I think, 285,000 Aboriginal people in Australia. Certainly, the government did not and could not have consulted individually with 285,000 people, but to suggest that the process of consultation was more adequate and, in a sense, more complete as a result of consultations being conducted with 224 Aboriginal people out of a total Aboriginal population of 285,000 is absurd in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a further comment in connection with the debate we had on this land fund bill. In checking back through some of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> records I notice that the shadow minister, the member for Hindmarsh, made some reference to criticisms I had made about her and about her capacity and competence. She made the quite absurd and petty claim that my expressed attitude towards the level of competence that she brought to her job was in some unspecified and strange way a response to some type of criticism that she had made about me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to advise the member for Hindmarsh that I have been criticised by experts. I do not include her among them. I subsequently identified what I think the comment probably was, and her comments about me are of no concern to me. I said that the honourable member for Hindmarsh, the shadow minister, was incompetent. I said that because she is. I said as well that the shadow minister was treated as a joke by the Aboriginal community around Australia. The reason I said that was that she is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said as well that she had used brave rhetoric when she was appointed as spokesperson for the opposition in connection with Aboriginal affairs. But when the former leader of the Liberal Party, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), pulled her into line and said that she would toe the line, she went to water immediately. I said that because she did, because they were the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that she had not consulted with Aboriginal people. I made that claim because it was true, and I made the claim because she had admitted to it. I said that she took advice from TV and not from Aboriginal people. I made that claim, not because of anything she said about me, but because she had admitted that she had listened to the television the previous night and had heard an Aboriginal person speaking, and that was the level of Aboriginal advice that she had received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also referred to the fact that she was the adviser to the former Leader of the Opposition when he made that ill-fated safari into Central Australia. She led him to the cliff and took him over it. I think the present Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), needs to be very careful because that is likely to happen to him also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was, of course, wet-nursed by the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). That was repeated on Monday when questions which, correctly, should have been directed by the shadow minister were being directed by the shadow minister for the environment. She was a disaster for the former Leader of the Opposition; I think she is a disaster waiting to happen for the present Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, it is important for the Aboriginal community that this legislation be passed. If it fails to pass again that provides the government with a further trigger. The Leader of the Opposition has said that if the opposition is elected to government it will introduce the changes provided for in the amendments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), in his speech made some remarks about consultation. Of course, the parliament or even the government sees consultation as dealing with a few people. The government's idea of consultation is to talk to Lois O'Donoghue and to that fellow Pearson, who says that he is the Cape York representative but lives in Sydney. The simple fact is that they consult very few people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry organised by the coalition advertised for persons all around Australia to make submissions. As has been stated, some 200 people turned up to state a view. Of course, there is a more subjective test and that might be a referendum of Aboriginal people on the simple issue of whether they would prefer, under these funding arrangements, to have the right to more individual land ownership. The member for Charlton can come and have a small bet with me on the outcome of that any time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is far different from talking to the Aboriginal industry, as the honourable member or Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) calls them. It is far different from a parliamentary inquiry. It is a straight-out test of the people I talk to in my electorate who have an entirely different view of how this money should be spent and who are already victims of the current land council type system. In fact, a group of good people were purchased a farm by ATSIC. But ATSIC did not have any money to buy them any livestock or any machinery, so they had a vacant farm. What is more, ATSIC did not buy them a very good farm. Do you know what people would have said if that group of Aborigines had failed? They would have said, `There you are. I told you the Aboriginals couldn't succeed if you bought them some land.' That is the way the system works now because it is bureaucratised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people were a bit above what many of any race would have done; they went out and got white farmers to share farm their land for them. They took their share in livestock and grazed the stubble. But it is hardly a way to promote the interests of Aboriginal people. Until recently, that went on for two or three years. So do not tell me that I do not consult or that I do not know what goes on, because my electorate is typical of what this land fund was supposed to be about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just before I go on further with that, let me also record another matter of grave concern that applies both to Aboriginal people and to our general Australian community. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) today has complained to this parliament that the case of the Commonwealth was weakened because somebody provided some additional information, some additional documents. I want to put on the record how civil actions work around Australia. They work on a process of disclosure of documents, principally to try to achieve settlement. That process requires persons representing the interests of both the plaintiff and the defendant to sign a statutory declaration in which they say, `Here is a list of all the documents associated with this action and I declare under oath there are no more.' Of course, you commit perjury if you do otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General&mdash;our principal law officer in this parliament&mdash;is complaining today that, when some extra documents turned up, it weakened the government's case and that that was dreadful. My interpretation of that is that the Attorney-General said that the Commonwealth denied the citizen involved in that action all and full disclosure. That is perjury, if that is the case. I warn the House that it is my intention to follow that through with the judge concerned, not because of its relationship to any particular action but because the Attorney-General has stood up in this place and said, `This is how we deal with the general citizenry of Australia when we get into litigation with them. We don't even tell them what the full list of documents are and we're prepared to sign statutory declarations to that effect.' That is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not oppose the land fund. The  opposition does not oppose legislation to implement that. All we have attempted to do at every stage is to add amendments that we think might have benefited the interests of Aboriginal people who, as I understand it, when the whole Mabo legislation went through this place, were the people identified as having no opportunity to get crown land, which is basically that land which might be still subject to Aboriginal land claim under Mabo. They said, `In relation to all these other people'&mdash;some live in Redfern and a number live in my electorate&mdash;`who are entitled,' in my view, `to some compensation, it can only be by going into the established system and buying them some land.' We approve of that and we are supporting that aspect of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are deeply concerned about the example I just gave and about another I want to give, which is even more alarming, as to the use of that money. The evidence is not there that a bureaucratic structure has properly dealt with it. We have the Northern Land Council with revenues of tens of millions of dollars, and we have the Central Land Council with lesser revenues, mostly mining royalties. I have never seen a Northern Land Council balance sheet and I cannot see any evidence when I go up there that that money is properly expended in areas that I think are appropriate, such as Aboriginal health, Aboriginal education and things of that nature. We have a massive bureaucracy which seems to spend most of its money going to court and which, in many cases, does not account, publicly at least, for the massive amounts of money that are paid to it by mining companies and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have pointed out how ATSIC has managed to go and buy some land for some people and really put them under the hammer, give them a no-win situation. What is our response to that? Our response to that is to say, `A component of this spending should be on more individualistic assistance,' and we refer to trusts. I have to say, in the case of those people I have just referred to, `Buy them some land, as individuals.' Buy them the land. Why not? Are they not to be trusted?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have to say that. Land is an economic situation for these people. The people I am talking about have long distanced themselves, by necessity, from tribal links. They are living in small country towns, they are living in a farming environment and many of them are expert farm workers. You cannot say to them, `Buzz off back into the desert.' They are not desert people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made that point to a journalist years ago when a young man tragically hanged himself in Geraldton and there was a consequent riot. The radio journalist said to me, `Oh, isn't this just the welling up of protest from these people?' I said, `Let me tell you a bit about this young man.' It was tragic, but his grandfather had been an endorsed Liberal candidate for parliament. You cannot talk about that person or that family as some ignorant bush Aborigine. It was tragic, and I do not want to go any further than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is that in my electorate these people have achieved a level in the existing European, if you like, society. It is totally inappropriate to tell them that they are tenant farmers. I do not think they should be tenant farmers. Let us say that it is in Redfern and they want a house. Why do we make them a tenant in the house? Why do we not give them the opportunity of home ownership and, in the case of my constituents, if all you can buy them is the land, the right to mortgage the land to buy the machinery and livestock, as any other Australian citizen would do?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely logical, and they would get on. These people have achieved in it diversity, because of the bureaucratic arrangements that were made. Why not just give them a go? They are all through my electorate&mdash;good people. Okay, there are those who, because they have no future, are drunk and have all those problems. The simple fact is that you are not going to rectify that by having Big Brother sitting in Melbourne and saying, `Yes, we will let you have a bit of land, but you will be a tenant on your own land.' That is the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all deeply concerned, both sides of the parliament, about the inability of the parliament, if you like, over time to address some of the fundamental issues like health. One of the fundamentals to health is nutrition, and nutrition is a major problem with Aboriginals, other than some of those I have mentioned. Alcoholism is the contributing factor to that because the money is spent on alcohol on pension day instead of being put aside for enough food for the kids for the week. You wonder why they have got this high incidence of pneumonia and everything else. They frequently just lack nutrition. That is an issue for this parliament to decide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too much money has been wasted. I have a distrust of some of these organisations. I bring one to the House's attention. Back in 1990 a major government decision was made to spend $614,640 of Aboriginal community development money. That decision was made through the proper process, it would appear. The application for its expenditure was made by Cedrick Wyatt, Western Australian Commissioner for Aboriginal Planning&mdash;a good man, a good Aboriginal man&mdash;on 31 May 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Cedrick Wyatt did not write the application. It was written by another person. That person is listed here as the contact officer. Cedrick Wyatt made his proposition to the Premier at the time, Dr Carmen Lawrence, whose signature appears on these documents. Dr Lawrence approved that, and there is nothing wrong with that. There is a note that reads `Premier wants press release on this ASAP'. The proposal was to form an Aboriginal home building trust, and there is nothing wrong with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document reads pretty well&mdash;that is, until you get down to some of the expenditures. It says that the part-time chairman's salary was to be, out of the $614,640 to build some shelter for Aboriginals, for the first year $35,000 and, for the second year, $35,000. Then, of course, that part-time chairman had to have a vehicle. Other expenses are listed as being $8,750. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, there is to be a project manager. The project manager's salary is $89,000 a year for both years. The project manager's expenses in year one were $7,900 and again $7,900 in the second year. The document goes on to mention office rental&mdash;$37,500. That is the rental for both years. Those examples are bad enough, and I could take you through the rest of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have tried to move an extra $3 million for administrative costs so that we can arrive at a process like we have with the Commonwealth funding of local government, where the last dollar that the Commonwealth provides ends up at that local government level at least and nothing is creamed off on the way through. I believe one of our amendments which has been rejected was to put an administrative fund separate to the land fund, and this is part of the reason why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a $614,000 program why would you want a part-time chairman at $35,000 a year? That person, by the way, just happened to be the retiring Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission, Shirley McPherson. Another person to be paid at the time&mdash;I am talking about 1992&mdash;was a lady called Katie George, whom some of you might remember was married to a former member of parliament, and I will say no more about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would you have all those people? You wonder why we have a distrust about giving this management this money. But it is worse than that. As I said, Cedrick Wyatt did not write the document. My copy did not have a covering sheet, but he might have signed one. The document was written by the person who is listed on this documentation as the contact officer, otherwise to be the project manager&mdash;a white man known as Brian Easton. That is a very interesting situation because, if we add up what he was to get in two years out of the $614,000, we find it was about $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Easton is famous for a couple of other things, including the fact that he orchestrated a petition through the parliament of Western Australia accusing his then living wife&mdash;she is now dead; she suicided as a result of this&mdash;of perjury because she went into the Family Court and said, `My husband has failed to declare all his assets. He was going to get a kickback from the Labor state government in Western Australia of $200,000.' At the time of writing this document, Brian Easton was an employee of the Public Service Commission and receiving a salary therefore. </PARA>

Brian Easton got his $200,000 as a kickback from the Aboriginal community development program because he claimed it was that and gave reasons for it, which are on the public record.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are about to legislate a land fund. The area of dispute has been that the coalition says this money would be better and more honestly handled in small parcels in the hands of individual Aboriginal families through trusts. I am giving you a concrete example of how hundreds of thousands of dollars contributed by the Australian taxpayer have been managed in the hands of large bureaucratic structures, which is the government's proposal. I am not trying to pick on your minister; I am just showing how a project can be totally rorted to the desperate disadvantage of Aboriginal people. Unfortunately, there are other examples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason the amendment should have status and should not be laughed out of court. It is time this parliament rethought the fundamentals of its funding of Aboriginal people. If in simple terms that model applied to the local government arena and if we had some weighted per capita grants&mdash;be it for land purchase, home building, education or anything else&mdash;serviced directly without this massive cream off by the bureaucracy, like we see on television every time one of these issues comes up, there is a fair chance at the grassroots that we might be addressing nutrition, health and other such issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I lived in a town with an Aboriginal population of 30 per cent. As chairman of the board&mdash;the mayor of the town, if you like&mdash;I sued the state minister for health in Western Australia to make him build some decent housing for those people, and that is a matter of record. As I say to people in my community, and to those in the communities I lived in for many years, the one thing that has to be incorporated is some European style accounting principles. It is not dishonesty as we know it; it has a lot to do with their tribal law. We have to protect those people with the chequebook but otherwise give them the decision-making capacity as close as possible to where the money is being spent. That is the broader issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we doing here? We are going back to the old land council concept, which has not worked. I will go to the Aboriginal people at any time in a referendum on how they would like this money distributed if there is a one-on-one secret vote and no-one geeing them up. They will vote to manage their own money, and a large number of them will do a good job. But you have to remember the people to whom this land fund was directed. Generally, they are not people with any existing tribal links; they are people who, for better or worse, are now in the general community. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You made it very clear what your assertion was. The Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, is pivotal to the long-term agenda of this government&mdash;clearly not to the opposition's agenda. After the episodes in the chamber today where the opposition shadow minister tried to defend the indefensible in relation to the Hindmarsh bridge, it is very clear to even the most casual observer that the opposition's contributions to these debates are not believed. They are not sincere. The Prime Minister on a number of occasions has lamented the lack of sincerity of the opposition frontbench on these issues. We now have two shadow ministers directly implicated, one of whom was censured today and one of whom should be censured; that is, the shadow spokesperson on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs for her role in assisting in the Hindmarsh bridge affair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have made it very clear how they regard Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interests&mdash;with absolute disdain. They treat Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interests and value systems with absolute contempt. That has been made abundantly clear again this afternoon by the previous speaker. Every time there is a debate in this place on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues, what do they do? They fall into the trap of attacking ATSIC and any one of a number of Aboriginal organisations around Australia, including land councils. In case the previous speaker has not noted, land councils are statutory authorities which report to this parliament and which are audited by the Auditor-General. He may not have noted that, but it is a fact. Yet he contemptuously walked in here and accused them of misspending money allocated for expenditure on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interests in this case in the Northern Territory with not a shred of evidence&mdash;not a shred. He continuously besmirches Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island interests, not unlike his counterparts in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Snow, the government sees this land fund as very much part of its trifecta for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Firstly, as the Prime Minister said in his second reading speech, we had the Mabo legislation. We now have the land fund bill and we will have a social justice package, which is currently being developed. They are very important parts of a matrix of policies designed to address the needs of indigenous Australians. I would have thought those matters would be accepted and supported by our opponents, not derided or degraded by the contemptuous approach they have adopted in these debates or by the way in which they have sought to besmirch, slander and libel individual Aboriginal people and Aboriginal organisations without a shred of evidence. But, as we know, that is how the member for O'Connor operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to repeat the words of the Prime Minister in his second reading speech. In the context of the measures in the legislation being a pivotal part of this government's long-term agenda, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that is, the promotion of reconciliation between indigenous Australians and other Australians; the national pursuit of greater understanding, greater respect, for our indigenous heritage; a just accounting for the wrongs done to indigenous Australians since European occupation of this country; and a coordinated campaign across all tiers of government to address the environmental and primary health problems faced by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been pursuing this great agenda consistently and methodically, confident of the continuing support of a country whose people share common aspirations and who embrace with pride the unique diversity of its people, culture and heritage.</PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate the Prime Minister. I put on the public record that I think he has shown much valued leadership in relation to these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has demonstrated a grasp of the detail, of the information and of the concerns of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and translated them into action; action which has been frustrated and thwarted by the opposition in this case and, in terms of the original land fund bill, in concert with the Greens in the Senate. When the Prime Minister spoke in his second reading speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third part of the Government's response to Mabo will be a set of social justice measures, designed to preserve and protect the cultural identity of our indigenous peoples while removing barriers which keep them at the margins of society as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a very real sense the Bill now before the house is itself a key component of our social justice response. It deals exclusively, however, with land&mdash;that critical part of the indigenous heritage which has been taken away from so many Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is for that reason&mdash;the essential importance of land in the resolution of outstanding issues between this nation and its indigenous peoples&mdash;that this Bill was introduced as a separate and distinct element of the Government's response to Mabo.</PARA>
<PARA>What the Prime Minister clearly said was that the social justice package encapsulated the land fund bill; that our social justice response required, as well as other aspects, this land fund bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the opposition's allies in the Northern Territory. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron, has absolute contempt for any concept of social justice and he has acknowledged that in the parliament of the Northern Territory. He acknowledged it also in a public forum in which he addressed the foreign correspondents in Sydney last year. I wish to quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS> of 20 May 1994 where Mr Perron said as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`absolutely appalling' health standards of remote aborigines who were `centuries behind us in their . . .  aspirations'.</PARA>
<PARA>It says a lot and it is typical of the response by the opposition. He also said that some Aborigines `shared their bones with dogs'. Later he said that he regarded the term `social justice' as frightening. I do not regard it as frightening; I regard it as doing justice to people for whom justice needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our opponents demonstrated their attitude last week and twice today. Last week, in his contribution to this debate, the Leader of the Opposition stood up in this chamber and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not vote against the passage of this legislation in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. We do that on a number of strict understandings that I want to make clear from the very beginning.</PARA>
<PARA>What are the strict understandings that he wants to make clear at the very beginning? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of those is that on election of the coalition government, which will inevitably occur whenever the election is held, we will vote to amend the land fund legislation to bring it into line with what was resolved by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Our conservative opponents do not believe in social justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The opposition wants to pull the rug out from underneath Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who will benefit by this land fund. How disingenuous are they?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not satisfied with attacking the fundamentals of the legislation&mdash;the seven deadly sins as they have been referred to by our colleagues in the Senate and by the Prime Minister&mdash;the opposition is attacking ATSIC, a body set up and supported by this parliament to look after the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the peak body to speak on their behalf. This afternoon we heard attacks on Lois O'Donoghue, the chairperson of ATSIC. Again, it is symptomatic of the opposition's approach to these issues. It is cynical, political grandstanding which does the opposition no credit. It is basically cynically opportunistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a couple of final points. The first point relates to the question that was addressed by the honourable member for O'Connor in relation to land. He talked about the misspending of funds. We know that the Northern Territory government is absolutely dead set opposed to the idea that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be able to purchase pastoral leases. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Depending how you are situated, these seem to be good times and bad times for the cattle industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>We all know that. He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you're in Central Australia and haven't recovered from the drought, or are surrounded by properties that have been taken over by Aboriginal interests&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>note what I have just said&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it's hard to find a silver lining.</PARA>
<PARA>He said further on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now for more bad news. We've heard on the grapevine of a push for Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account reserves of around twenty million dollars to be used to buy up pastoral properties for Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA>What do we say to those opposite? Can they defend these sorts of approaches? Do they truly come in here and say they support the idea of a land fund and then support this nonsense? I had a call today from the `dreaded' land council&mdash;one of those Commonwealth statutory bodies that reports annually to the parliament and is audited by the Auditor-General. The director of the Central Land Council, Tracker Tilmouth, phoned me to report that Darwin cattle sales have been getting the best prices in Australia. Last week cattle from three Aboriginal pastoral properties have brought in the best prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Results at West Farmers Dalgety export computerised sales held on 2 March show all cattle selling at improved rates above recent sales. The majority of the cattle were presented from Aboriginal owned and run properties in the Northern Territory&mdash;some purchased and some acquired as a result of the Land Rights Act which this government supports. Our opponents in the Northern Territory certainly oppose it. I am not quite sure where the opposition stands, because you never know if it is telling you the truth. He said that cattle from Mistake Creek, an Aboriginal owned pastoral property in the west of the Northern Territory, topped the sale price at $1.50 per kilogram for 312 steers. Elsie and Fitzroy station cattle got similarly good prices. There demonstrates the interests and integrity of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory in utilising land for commercial purposes&mdash;not the sorts of purposes about which we are told by our opponents, particularly the member for O'Connor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to finish by talking about housing, which we understand is one of the things that should be dealt with in providing resources from a land fund. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, headed by a Senate colleague of ours, Senator Loosley, visited a number of dwellings at Pigeon Hole on Victoria River Downs. In its report the committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dwellings were approximately 6m x 2m. They housed 10 to 12 people, although at times this could increase to 20. There was a need for maintenance in a number of areas. Most of the houses were without fittings or furniture. The committee saw exposed electrical switches and ceiling fans which did not work. Many of the septic systems were blocked and overflowing. Pools of sewage flowing around the houses created a health hazard. This was exacerbated in the wet season when the overflows became mixed with floodwater around the settlement. This situation and the resultant sickness among children was a particular concern to the women in the community.</PARA>
<PARA>Absolutely correct. Instead of talking about the land fund, why does the opposition not talk about the responsibility and where it lies? It lies directly with the host government, which is of course the Northern Territory government. What does the Northern Territory minister responsible for Aboriginal development, Mr Hatton, say about these things? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been around. I have seen them. I have talked to communities and I have tried to address them.</PARA>
<PARA>Remember that the CLP has been in office in the Northern Territory for 17 years. Tried to address them indeed! Do you know how much it has spent on Aboriginal housing this last financial year, according to its own words, on top of $19.5 million under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement&mdash;money which is funded from us, the taxpayers of Australia, through the Northern Territory&mdash;for Aboriginal housing? The Northern Territory government admits this. Hatton, in the Northern Territory parliament on Tuesday, 28 February 1995, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That has been the ATSIC theory that we are working to counteract. In 1991-92, there was $3m for land servicing and $3.5m in 1992-93. In 1993-94&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is on top of the $19 million; in fact, the Commonwealth's contribution through ATSIC and the Commonwealth-state housing agreement added up to about $52 million, not $19&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there was $2m for Aboriginal housing and infrastructure and $2.7m in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA>That is less than one-twentieth of the contribution of the Commonwealth, yet they say they are concerned about Aboriginal housing and health. It is their responsibility, something which our opponents will not address. He continues in the same debate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say we are doing everything we can to address the problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Frankly, that is way beyond the available resources of 170,000 people who live in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>Providing $120 million to build a new parliament house to house 25 parliamentarians did not present a problem at all to the Northern Territory government and Minister Hatton, who was, at one time, a chief minister. But when asked to address Aboriginal health and housing needs, what do they say? They say, `Take it out of the land fund.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think I have to say anything else. My case rests. I have demonstrated, quite appropriately I think, the deception and, in some sense, the bigotry of some of our opponents, although not all, and the cynical political opportunism with which they have approached this debate. I think they ought to be condemned. I am glad this land fund bill will go through this parliament. I hope the opposition does stick to its word and supports it in both houses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's legislation, the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994, is part of the flow on from the Mabo decision 2 1/2 years ago. The High Court decision in Mabo v. Queensland righted a 200-year-old historic wrong. By overturning the legal fiction of terra nullius&mdash;the claim that this land belonged to no-one before European settlement&mdash;and recognising native title, the High Court acknowledged that indigenous Australians had always known that their ancestors lived on this continent, that they are the heirs to the oldest continuous culture in the world and that this is their country too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's bill is part of the legislation that stems from that extraordinary judgment and sets up a $1.4 billion land fund to help indigenous Australians unable to lodge Mabo style native title claims. The government's main legislative response, the 1993 Native Title Bill, was, unfortunately, a flawed piece of legislation. This offering, too, is far from perfect. However, we are not opposing it today so that Aboriginal people will not be denied the benefits of the land fund provisions and as a sign of the importance we attach to this particular area of public policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In preparing this speech, I looked through some old copies of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, which proved to be something of a learning experience. Four years ago, when the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was discussed in this place, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), then the coalition spokesman on Aboriginal and Islander affairs, began his speech like this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I rise with pleasure to announce the Opposition's support for the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill 1991. This is significant because it is the first time in eight years that there has been bipartisan support for a major piece of Aboriginal affairs legislation. This has come about due to six months work and consultation, and it has come about because the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation (Mr Tickner) and the Government have been very much prepared to substantially address the concerns of the opposition on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>As we debate the land fund bill today, one might well ask:  what happened? The same minister still holds the portfolio. However, his job now involves little more than sitting at the table during debates. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is the man who has the real say. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) primes the canvas, the Prime Minister does the rest as he goes to work on his big picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a remarkable contrast. We know the sincerity of the minister. We know his decency. We know the commitment to bipartisanship he has shown. The Prime Minister's approach must be galling for him. As the shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), has pointed out, the Prime Minister can give a speech full of power and grand emotion, like when he launched the International Year of Indigenous People in Redfern. But when he comes into this House, he is crippled by his own prejudices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all his flaunted erudition, the Prime Minister is only half a man. He is so gnawed by hatred that he must reduce every issue, no matter what it involves, to a them and us battle. He is a street fighter, not a statesman. He cannot miss a chance to play politics in its crudest forms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is in love with his own vision thing, a half-sketched jumble of ideas and grand designs. He jets off to a community with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> in tow&mdash;presumably its ratings outweigh the matter of its ownership&mdash;to show his concern for indigenous Australians. But when this parliament attempts to legislate to help these people, he makes sure it becomes as much of a battle as any inner Sydney backstreet brawl. The Prime Minister does not seem to realise the danger of his approach. This House, and this parliament, supported the establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation because of our awareness of the unhappiness, uncertainty, suspicion and, most dangerous of all, resentment that clouds relations between black and white Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal and islander affairs should not be a matter for dispute and competition between political parties. Those of us who are prepared to be fair-minded about it must admit that no side of this House has a monopoly on wisdom when it comes to these affairs. Instead, we should be acknowledging them as matters of national and international shame that we should be tackling together, to fix them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's debate should not be a competition to determine which party is the most caring and compassionate. The enormous political, administrative and financial efforts in indigenous affairs have brought rewards. But in some matters, the condition of Aboriginal Australians is not only far behind that of the white population, it is worse than ever. If the Prime Minister is determined to turn every issue in Aboriginal affairs into a fight, it will be very easy for the enemies of reconciliation to start portraying the whole area as a failure and as an extravagant waste of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This threat by those people should not be taken lightly. Already in the last few weeks we have seen feuding between John Laws, Charlie Perkins and the minister over accountability. Mr Laws is generally regarded as a responsible member of his industry. Other self-appointed sages on talkback shows may be much more prepared to crassly use race for divisive purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been a great deal of community concern about the clash between ATSIC and the Commonwealth Ombudsman over her report into allegations raised by the New Burnt Bridge Aboriginal community&mdash;a community I visited with the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) when I was on the House of Representatives Aboriginal affairs committee. Debate on this issue has already spilled over into the House with the member for Chifley (Mr Price) last week raising possible privilege aspects of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe these two points illustrate a growing impatience that many Australians feel over the lack of advancement of all the programs designed to assist indigenous people, an impatience that may well become a force for racial division in this country unless we can produce some real results. Most average suburban whites can expect to live their lives without ever meeting one of the country's original inhabitants. They will never talk to an Aboriginal Australian, let alone know or befriend one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will know what a boomerang is; they will know what a didgeridoo is; they will probably recognise the term, `the Dreamtime', but that will probably be the extent of their knowledge of the culture, the lifestyle and the traditions of a people who have lived in this land for tens of thousands of years. This is exactly why the reconciliation process is so important, why it has been a bipartisan effort and why the Prime Minister risks undoing work that still has such a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an enormous amount of goodwill in this place on the issue of indigenous affairs, but the Prime Minister insists on a definition of bipartisanship that other people would describe as acquiescence. He is not interested in constructive debate, in an exchange of thoughts or ideas; and his arrogance ultimately could harm indigenous Australians. The Prime Minister has poured scorn on the work of the coalition and the other parties in the Senate that was carried out to produce the optimum land fund bill. He has accused the Senate committee of dallying during the consultation process, where its members travelled 12,000 kilometres and heard the concerns of 224 people. He talks about the other place gutting and undermining his government's bill and yet has picked up 28 of the amendments made to the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a long time it has been clear that this bill has offered two tests for the government&mdash;its bona fides on indigenous affairs and whether or not it has had anything approaching a commitment to bipartisanship. It has become more than clear that there is nothing in the latter part of the question and, as the debate has unfolded, serious doubt has arisen over the first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the first land fund bill was debated in the House last August, the coalition has stressed its concern over the matters of Aboriginal health, education and housing. Grants or purchases of land, while important, are no substitute for policies that offer the dignity and stability that come from an improved lifestyle and genuine independence. The member for Mayo (Mr Downer) made our position clear in his speech on the bill when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Land is an important aspect of Aboriginal health. The concept of Aboriginal health is a holistic one which encompasses the special and unique relationship that Aboriginal people have with the land. It is for these reasons that I support the various state mechanisms for purchasing or otherwise acquiring land for Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land is important, but to focus on land to the exclusion of other pressing issues is to ignore the facts and simply re-run previously failed policies. Land alone is no panacea for Aboriginal health, education and social problems.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition and other parties in the Senate undertook real consultation. We took account of the diversity that exists among our indigenous people. The bill that resulted from our amendments offered new opportunities for Aboriginal people to look after their own interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these amendments stem from concern over basic human needs. We wanted the Indigenous Land Corporation to be able to look at what could be done with land it purchased. We wanted the ILC to be able to examine whether it could provide housing. We wanted the ILC to be able to provide sealed roads to stop problems with dust. We wanted the ILC to be able to provide adequate supplies of quality drinking water and the sewerage services necessary to provide for good health and hygiene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the amendments concerned legal matters. Many Aboriginal people were unhappy with the idea of corporations, finding family trusts a more easily understandable way to approach land purchases and management. We wanted to make sure that the ILC consulted with traditional users of land without any native title claim if buying them for other people. All these amendments have been rejected by the government, yet they made perfect sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little benefit for anyone if the Indigenous Land Corporation purchases land where it is impossible to provide a decent standard of living and the fundamentals of good health. It is typical bureaucratic absurdity and intolerance to attempt to force alien management structures on people not only with a poor level of understanding of business and commercial enterprises but also often suffering from distressingly low levels of illiteracy that make these structures even harder to understand. It is even more absurd for the situation to exist where traditional owners&mdash;denied the opportunity of making a native title claim by, say, a previous pastoral lease but still using the land&mdash;could have this territory bought by the ILC for an entirely different group of people without consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has already been a major incident of violence over land in the far north of my state of South Australia this year. In January, one person was shot dead and several were injured in the town of Marree in a dispute between the Arabana and Dieri people over who could claim the tribal rights to the Finniss Springs region north of the town. This ill-considered legislation could create the potential for similar clashes on a wider scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is exactly for these reasons that we believe the amendments we inserted into the original land fund bill were entirely justified. It is why we believe they would have made the bill fairer and more responsive to the actual needs of Aboriginal people. And it is why, despite supporting this bill here today, we would seek to remove the inadequacies of the current legislation that the government has proposed. We understand and appreciate the central role that land has played in Aboriginal culture and know the problems alienation from land has caused. However, we also know that land, or loss of land, has not been the sole cause of the enormous problems Aboriginal people now face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, if we consider the current range of difficulties indigenous Australians confront as a matter of shame, then surely this disgrace is even further compounded by the fact that so much of this suffering takes place on their own lands, that all too many Aboriginal communities are beset by problems over health, housing, education, water and sanitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than $10 billion has been spent on Aboriginal programs over the last 10 years. The total for this year alone is expected to be around $3 billion. If abysmal conditions can still exist for all too many Aboriginal Australians when this amount of money is being spent, then it is all too understandable why people may fear that the $1.4 billion that this bill provides over the next decade will do little to ameliorate the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basic demographics show that the difficulties Aboriginal people face are likely to increase over coming years. Between 1971 and 1991, our indigenous population more than doubled from 115,000 to 265,000, showing a growth rate of between four per cent and five per cent, compared with less than a one per cent natural increase in the population as a whole. Only some of this increase can be attributed to more people choosing to publicly identify themselves as Aboriginal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a relatively young indigenous population with a high birthrate and limited use of birth control. This will result in larger families and overcrowding and even more strain on infrastructure that all too often is either hopelessly inadequate or entirely non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fewer than 25 per cent of indigenous children already finish secondary school, and 13 per cent never attend. The first Maori university graduate received his degree in 1893. When Charles Perkins became the first Aboriginal man to graduate from a university in this country, it was 1965. Almost a quarter of Aboriginal people lack proper access to housing, clean water and effective sewerage. What will their increasing numbers do to assist this situation, and how will the land fund solve their immediate needs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We already know that Aboriginal people can expect to die 20 years earlier than other Australians. There is no clearer way to display the enormous gap between black and white Australia than by looking at the issues of health and mortality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hepatitis B, eye infections, and chronic skin problems are all common in Aboriginal communities. Indigenous people are seven times more likely to die from respiratory disease than members of the white community. They are 12 times more likely to succumb to parasitic and infectious diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the work to improve the lifestyle of indigenous Australians started with the Gorton Liberal government. People like Dr Charles Rowley, famed for books like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Outcasts in White Australia</EMPHASIS>, studied Aboriginal communities and researched the conditions they lived in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Rowley was appointed head of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission by the Whitlam government, and remained in that post under Malcolm Fraser. But by the early to mid-1980s, as he updated his research, he found that many things had become worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all recognise that there will not be a truly just society in Australia until the lot of our indigenous people has been improved. That is one of the reasons that the Prime Minister's determination to play politics on every issue, to reject the amendments the coalition has offered as a genuine contribution to the reconciliation process to improve the conditions of Aboriginal Australians, is so regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any land fund should provide indigenous people with demonstrable needs. Today's bill fails to do so. It establishes the Indigenous Land Corporation, but fails to say what the clear purposes for buying land are or who the corporation will assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATSIC amendment bill fails to make the critical links between land purchase and health, housing, education and economic independence.

The basic issue is that we should not have to be here discussing this matter at all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I readily acknowledge that there are a number of people on the opposition side who have very good intentions and who would probably like to support the bill as now put forward by the government, particularly in light of amendments that have been made, but of course they are not a majority&mdash;far from it&mdash;in their own party room. So they must take a collective responsibility, as they urge us to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is&mdash;and it is now proven once and for all&mdash;that the opposition does not accept the basic tenets of the Mabo decision. Members of the opposition have shown this through the saga of their quite miserable attempts to sabotage this very real and most important chance for Aboriginal people to deal as equals with the people of the political, social and economic culture that invaded this land&mdash;their land&mdash;over 200 years ago. That alien culture was brought to this country. It is now recognised by the High Court&mdash;and, indeed, by this parliament&mdash;that the Aborigines were here first. People from that alien culture basically invaded this country and attempted to subjugate the Aborigines and disorientate them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) is keen, as others have been, to point to the last 12 years as seemingly when all things should have been done and were not. I think we do have to acknowledge that, while Australians here today may not have been here 200 years ago and may not have been party to some of the things that occurred in years gone by, we have to accept our obligation today to overcome the problems that have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To Europeans and others who have come in the last 200 years, the land we now live on is property. It is essentially individual property. It is the basis of acquisition, of control and of wealth. But to the Aborigine the concept is very different. It is spiritual or religious; it is existence&mdash;food, water and medicine. It is culture and social organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think members of the opposition really understand this&mdash;or if they do they are not prepared to put it into practice&mdash;because their actions totally belie all the words that they have used in this place to present themselves as kind, intelligent and aware people.

The government has already accepted a further 29 amendments to the land fund bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Thursday, 16 February I attended a meeting in Port Augusta to discuss the world heritage listing of the Lake Eyre basin. I have stated before in this House that I am opposed to this listing. The coalition is certainly opposed to the listing in its current form, the South Australian government is opposed, many regions of my electorate are opposed and certainly the local industries and the local people are opposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Port Augusta meeting was attended by pastoralists, many people from the mining industry, Aboriginal people and many people from various churches and other interested parties. Indeed, this particular meeting was organised by one of the mainstream churches. The Uniting Church, the Catholic Church and the Anglican Church right throughout the region and, indeed, nationally have expressed considerable concern about the process and the stress that it is placing upon the people living in the region. This issue has been running for at least two years, certainly since the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) put it on the agenda just before the last election. People are living under a cloud of uncertainty, knowing that their homes and livelihoods are at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Conservation Council has been working towards the nomination of the Lake Eyre basin for world heritage listing since 1985. The prime example that it looked to in the management of world heritage was the Willandra Lakes. It has been 12 years since the heritage listing was applied and there is still no management plan. It is a scandal that the residents of that area have had their livelihoods almost destroyed. Their personal and emotional state is such that many of them are looking to get out if they possibly can, and it is because of this isolated and remote decision from Canberra. That is what is hanging over the Lake Eyre basin&mdash;the ghost of Willandra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot put it too strongly in this place that there is a far stronger responsibility on government and on this parliament to recognise what has happened at Willandra and what is now going on in the Lake Eyre basin. The federal government so far has displayed no commitment to Lake Eyre. In last year's budget the South Australian government did commit $1 million over the next two years to the protection of the environment; whereas this 1994-95 federal budget, as I said, has nothing. The council claims that the pastoralists can jump onto the wonderful bandwagon called ecotourism. Not many actually believe that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as mining goes, the region is host to the great Olympic Dam mining operation at Roxby Downs, which creates thousands of jobs, billions of dollars of investment and hundreds of millions of export dollars per annum. So there we have misguided conservationists, some playing politics and some well meaning, mainly working from Adelaide and from the eastern states, placing local people under quite incredible stress, under quite remarkable pressure and threatening them and threatening their local economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The boundaries of the proposed listings are still largely unknown. No management plan has been proposed. When the people of Willandra have waited over a decade for theirs, how can the people of Lake Eyre expect to have one in the future? So it is a very sorry story. The people of Willandra bear testimony to the reality, and the people at Lake Eyre are very much affected by what happened there and what they believe will happen to them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I and countless others have always suspected there is something fishy about this government's attitude to small business. Tonight I want to illustrate this perception by bringing to the House's notice a ridiculous situation that has been allowed to develop by the inaction of the government where a simple bit of logical thinking could have assisted a potential Australian success story. I speak about koi breeding. For those unfamiliar with things aquatic, koi is a particular breed of fish&mdash;somewhat like a very large goldfish. I note the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) is imitating a goldfish. Koi is highly valued for its bright colours and ease of maintenance in ponds and aquariums.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Koi are currently grown in many parts of Australia under certain strict federal licences. Another name for koi is the European carp. Carp have been cultivated in Europe since the 13th century. Carp were introduced to Australia, according to the first available documented records, at Prospect Reservoir in 1907, though some sources indicate it may have been as early as the 1850s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to carp on about this, but it has been brought to my attention that the koi breeding industry in this country is in danger of becoming moribund through a lack of new genes in the breeding pool. Doesn't that sound a bit like the government frontbench, I ask the honourable member opposite. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A school of guppies mouthing off as the good ship Australia sinks slowly after an altercation with the twin icebergs of interest rates and crushing national debt. As a consequence of genetic strength, the quality of Australian koi is rapidly falling. I am told by a Western Australian breeder, Mr John Cole of the Perth Koi Farm, that the genetic make-up of local fish is so low that the industry fears it may soon be unable to compete with a vital and growing industry in South-East Asia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government refuses to allow Australian koi breeders to import healthy gene-rich koi&mdash;carp&mdash;to renew their flagging stocks because of a belief that the fish may be a danger to the local environment and wildlife. No doubt there are no such import restrictions on the caviar the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) favours, nibbling away while lounging around in the Lodge with his clocks on his many days off from this place. But why nibble away at what is potentially a very viable industry which could compete internationally and earn some of those valuable export dollars in Asia the Prime Minister is always carping about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here is the rub: not only do koi farmers operate under very stringent licence arrangements to quite properly ensure the captive koi are not released into the greater environment, but a report by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture actually debunks this suggestion&mdash;the suggestion that the government uses to make its decisions: that carp are a danger to the environment&mdash;it would have us believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 Mr L.F. Reynolds, chief of the Division of Fisheries in Sydney and an acknowledged expert in fish agriculture, wrote an article devoted to carp in the authoritative magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Agfacts</EMPHASIS>. The summary of that article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is doubtful there are any serious deleterious effects of carp.</PARA>
<PARA>In the article itself, Mr Reynolds went further. He also addressed in his report the environmental and social effects and the effect on native fish of carp. He went on to say in relation to the environment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of this criticism is ill-founded and does not stand up to accurate scientific assessment . . . the claim that the introduction of carp has encouraged overgrowth of algae is not supported . . . there is no evidence to suggest (carp destroy aquatic vegetation).</PARA>
<PARA>On the effects on native fish, he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unlikely carp actively prey on other species of fish.</PARA>
<PARA>On the social effects, he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Carp have been much maligned out of ignorance. Carp, because they are readily seen and caught, are thought to be abundant when, in reality, they are not.</PARA>
<PARA>It is hardly a major environmental menace even in the wild&mdash;let alone bred under strict supervision for aquariums and rock pools in people's backyards. So here we have another example of the intransigence and backward thinking of the government&mdash;mental bottom feeders, as the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) is fond of saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The koi industry in South-East Asia is, as I have already mentioned, booming. The export potential to Australia is real, except the government has handcuffed the producers' ability to produce a quality product to sell overseas. Oh, yes&mdash;local producers can export koi. There is no problem there. Breed them here, sell them overseas but do not try to import a couple of breeders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this year there will be a worldwide exhibition of koi in Brunei, one of the countries where Australia's tadpole of a koi export industry is gaining a flipper or fin hold. How will koi breeders in Western Australia, indeed across Australia, where the gene pool is stagnating compete for world business when their exhibits have been so badly savaged by this government's short-sightedness? I urge the government to review the situation regarding koi importation as a matter of great urgency. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent Commonwealth Grants Commission report, which was released this week, has shown that Victoria now spends less per capita on public education than any state. It also shows that Victoria spent $511 per head of population on government schools in the 1993-94 year&mdash;the lowest amount in Australia and $27 less than the national average. This has led to a situation now where 62 per cent of primary school classes have 26 students or more&mdash;in fact, 7.2 per cent of classes have 40 or more students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt some of these classes are in the electorates of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) and other Victorian members of the coalition, who I am sure are very concerned about the actions of the Kennett government in relation to education in their electorates. Rural electorates are in urgent need of services and have been kicked in the guts good and proper under this Kennett government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victoria's total spending on education is also the lowest in Australia. Victoria spent $730 per capita on overall education services, compared with the national average of $758. That figure includes spending on preschools&mdash;which we know the Kennett government has cut&mdash;private and public schools, TAFE, and the transport of rural students. It is a disgrace. The government has closed 271 schools, sacked about 8,200 teachers and cut $400 million from the education budget. It is no wonder retention rates are plummeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last Tuesday, there was an article relating to problems in secondary schooling. A report by the director of Monash University's diploma of education program, Dr Jeff Northfield, showed that in fact many Victorian students in secondary school are being taught by unqualified teachers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following from the contribution of the member for Corinella (Mr Griffin), I wish to make some separate points. In Victoria we are now witnessing the spectacle of the Uniting Church, the Anglican Church and the Catholic church to varying degrees carrying the banner against the New Right's privatisation agenda. We know that the SEC, gas and water are well and truly on the agenda. I look forward to my friends in the Islamic community and all other ethnic churches joining the struggle against Jeff Kennett's arrogant, undemocratic privatisation juggernaut.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kennett's obsession will only serve the interests of his corporate mates and, in the long run, extend the growing inequality within Australia. The sad reality is that, although I presume members of the Left of the Labor Party&mdash;particularly the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), the parliamentary secretary who is not before us and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), who is sitting at the dispatch box at the moment&mdash;have carried on the debate against privatisation in the backrooms, the Hilmer report, a myopic view of competition, and simplistic notions about efficiency have primed Australia for further privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, the ALP privatised Loy Yang B Power Station, corporatised Melbourne Water, sold its railway stock and sold its State Bank. The member for Corinella should not ignore that those priming exercises have occurred at state and federal levels. Ask a Victorian ALP parliamentarian what his or her position is on privatisation and you will not get a straight answer. At the federal level, the Commonwealth Bank, Australian Airlines, Qantas, the FAC, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and a host of other utilities have been sold off or are in the process of being sold off. Telecom, a public asset, had to offer its infrastructure to Optus, and now the Murdoch empire is getting a pay television piggyback on Telecom into Australian households. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Australia Post amendment bill&mdash;a bill which lowered the barriers against private participation in the postal market&mdash;was passed, ALP members spent their time praising the efficiency of Australia Post. I was left wondering why the legislation was before the parliament. Ask the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) about privatisation and he will tell you, as he recently told the parliament, `The government has a proud record of successful privatisations.' I do not think that is terribly ambiguous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that the struggle against privatisation has to be taken on by the churches. It is not occurring in the parliaments of Australia. As the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party knows, in the cruel laissez-faire days of the late 19th century and in the 1930s, it was the Uniting Church and other churches which attempted to redress the inequities of rampant capitalism. It is ironic that in the 1990s the churches should again be reminding governments of their social responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal revenue cuts to the states, an issue taken up by John Langmore and John Quiggan in their book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Work for all</EMPHASIS>, are central to the predicament. In Victoria we have seen the sorry spectacle of the Leader of the Labor Party trying to undermine a public float of the TAB, thus ensuring that private buyers have a windfall at the expense of the public purse. It has been enough to threaten shadow cabinet member Neil Cole's parliamentary career. Ask John Brumby which schools he would reopen or ask him to promise that he would buy back any public asset sold off by Kennett and he will tell you that he'll look into it. The evidence is compelling in confirming that the sell off of private utilities, in particular electricity, gas and water, not only increases inequality but also endangers the health of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Melbourne Water, corporatised under Labor, has instituted a toll on toilet flushing. Honourable members who rose in this House last week during private member's business to encourage the government to allocate more money to prostate cancer research might like to think about Kennett's toilet toll. Otherwise I suppose we could all plant a few more lemon trees and at night, when we have to duck out for a quickie, we could run straight out to the tree to save a few bucks. I suppose our prostate would last a bit longer. </PARA>

New Zealand and Britain, countries which have led the world in privatisation, are at the forefront of the production of inequality. Growing inequality and the desire of governments to privatise in a short-term grab for revenue is bringing on a crisis in our communities. Members of the Left continue to claim that the government is committed to social justice. The problem is that more and more people are becoming dependent on welfare and less and less in control of their own lives. </PARA>

While there has been economic development, much of it remains in the hands of Javanese and other non-Timorese, many of them in the military.

The chairman of the Indonesian Human Rights Commission said that the violation of human rights occurred before, during and after the incident in the Liquica region on 12 January which resulted in the deaths of six unarmed civilians. The vice-chairman of the commission said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have stated that torture and intimidation did happen . . . deaths did occur as a result of unlawful shootings.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission's findings will likely generate more pressure on the Indonesian government to rethink its current handling of East Timor, particularly the pervasive Indonesian security presence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the background to this rising tension has been the Indonesian government's policy of encouraging migration from the more crowded provinces of Indonesia into East Timor. Whilst relations with local Timorese have generally been good, many Timorese have interpreted the migration as part of a policy of obliterating East Timorese identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What these problems indicate is that the Indonesian government has failed to convince large numbers of East Timorese to accept the integration of the territory into Indonesia. Although the Indonesians have brought considerable resources to bear to overcome the neglect inherited from Portuguese colonialism, the military continues to be relied upon to buttress rule from Jakarta and army officers are widely seen as corruptly profiting from their positions of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leader of the Catholic church in East Timor, Bishop Belo, has been outspoken in his criticism of repression, corruption and abuse of human rights. For this reason it is important that we call upon the Indonesian government to promote reconciliation with the people of East Timor. Measures which could help soothe recently inflamed feelings include acceleration of the promised reduction in troop numbers and greater sensitivity to East Timor's distinctive cultural and religious identity. There also needs to be greater attention to promoting economic development which is seen by the Timorese to be of benefit to the local people themselves rather than to people from outside the province. Finally, the particular history and character of East Timor would seem to justify the provision of some form of greater administrative autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesian government's attempt to impose a military solution on East Timor has not only failed but also continues to stain Indonesia's reputation in the world community and to be an irritant in its foreign relations; to be, in the words of foreign minister Alatas, `a pebble in the shoe' for Indonesia. The time has come for the Indonesian government to make a clear gesture that it is willing to consider options for greater autonomy for East Timor. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr Lee</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. The ABA has reported that two thirds of the complaints made directly to the ABA are lodged by telephone. Reports by its predecessor, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, indicated there was a similar level of telephone complaint prior to 1992. The ABA continues to keep a record of all complaints lodged with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. The ABA registered the Federation of Commercial Television Stations' (FACTS) Code of Practice on 5 September 1993 having been satisfied that the three mandatory criteria for registration, set out in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, had been met. That is, the code provided appropriate community safeguards, it had been endorsed by a majority of FACTS members and the public had been given adequate opportunity to comment on the code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 7 of the FACTS Code requires each licensee to report to FACTS quarterly on the number and substance of written complaints alleging breaches of the Code. FACTS in turn reports quarterly to the ABA on complaints received by its members. It should be noted that, before this code was registered, there was no requirement for broadcasters to report the complaints lodged directly to them to the ABA (previously the ABT). I understand that FACTS will also include in their reports to the ABA, an analysis of the telephone complaints and comments received by stations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A viewer can refer a complaint to the ABA for investigation where the broadcaster has not responded within the prescribed time, or where a complainant is not satisfied with the response received from the broadcaster. The ABA investigates all such complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABA does not register the codes of practice of the ABC and SBS. The national broadcasters are required to notify the ABA of their codes of practice, which also include a complaints procedure. A viewer can refer a complaint to the ABA for investigation in the same circumstances as for a commercial broadcaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Complaints addressed to the ABC Managing Director or Chair are recorded by ABC Corporate Relations and reported in its annual report. Complaints to the SBS are registered and statistics are included in the SBS annual report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FACTS Code of Practice requires that complainants be informed of the complaints process, including their right to refer their complaint to the ABA for investigation. Many complaints are also made in the first instance to the ABA. In such cases complainants are informed of the complaints process, provided with copies of the relevant code of practice and advised to seek a resolution of the complaint with the broadcaster before the ABA can investigate further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The quarterly reports from FACTS are not the only measures employed by the ABA in monitoring the effectiveness of the FACTS Code. Apart from records of telephone and written complaints made directly to it, as well as the number of unresolved complaints referred to it for investigation, the ABA uses data compiled from research into community attitudes about program matters and thorough public consultation processes. This, together with information from the ABC and SBS annual reports, gives an accurate measure of community attitudes and concerns about commercial and national television. The ABA regularly reports on television and radio complaints in its "Update" magazine and complaints reports are also made public via press release and media comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) I have indicated above that proper statistical records are maintained by all television operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) Procedures already in place, ensure community awareness of all available avenues of complaint in regard to television programming. The FACTS Code requires commercial broadcasters to provide regular on-air information about the code and the complaints procedure. The ABA monitors compliance with this requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC promotes community awareness of complaint avenues through a series of television promotions and has distributed widely a pamphlet explaining procedures for lodging a complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Avenues for complaints about SBS are publicised through promotions broadcast on SBS Television and SBS Radio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABA has published a free complaints pamphlet, advising viewers how to complain about the content of television programs, for distribution to the public and community groups. It also has a 1800 (free call) number in the Telecom White Pages throughout Australia, together with an after-hours answering facility, and a telephone typewriter number to assist hearing impaired people.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) All DASR flying operations managers and inspectors are required to keep their flight crew licences current except for three flying operations managers (MFOs) based in Canberra.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. All line flying arrangements with air operators are formalised under a legal contract. Regional and District Managers are charged with ensuring that there is no conflict of interest in respect of Flying Operations Inspectors (FOI) undertaking line flying under these contracts. Surveillance of all operators is conducted in accordance with standardised procedures contained in the surveillance manual (ASSP manual). Provision is made in this manual for surveillance of an operator to be reduced where an FOI is conducting line flying with that operator. The basis for this arrangement is that the FOI, even when line flying, has an obligation as an officer of the Authority to report on observations made in relation to the operator's level of compliance with standards. Comprehensive guidance material is provided in the ASSP manual.</PARA>
