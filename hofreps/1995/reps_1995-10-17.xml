<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I do not intend to detain the House for very long but I feel it appropriate that there should be some remarks on the record about the procedures which the government is adopting. We will not propose a division in respect of this procedural motion but it is worthy of note that it appears that this motion is being moved by the government so as to dispose from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> a private member's bill&mdash;the Sydney Airport Curfew (Air Navigation Amendment) Bill 1995&mdash;presented by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would appreciate, Mr Speaker, the substantive issues which this bill canvasses go to the fact that there has been a failure by the government over a period of 12 1/2 years to do anything at all to entrench the curfew at the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. The bill presented by the member for Bennelong attempts to remedy the government's chronic failure in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would be aware, Mr Speaker, as a result of a private member having a bill before the House, there is the opportunity for a private member to effectively ask another private member&mdash;in this case, a most dignified one, being the member for Bennelong&mdash;a question about the progress of that bill for which he or she is responsible. Mr Speaker, when you and I first came into this place such a question was a rare one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you go back over <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> you will find that there might have been one or two examples. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> was carefully worded so as to constrain the nature of the question and particularly to constrain the extent of the response from the person to whom the question was put. As practice has developed, it is now the case&mdash;as you remarked in September this year when a number of questions were put to the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;that a reasonable amount of latitude is given to the person in charge of the bill to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make the point that this portrays a development in the practice of the House which is important to acknowledge. When I first came into the place, for all the politicisation of the parties, question time went for about 45 minutes. On average, we had 15 or 16 questions per question time and answers were two or three minutes in duration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years&mdash;I must say, over the Labor years&mdash;it is true that the number of questions being asked by the opposition has been significantly curtailed. In Malcolm Fraser's time the number of questions asked in one year averaged 18 or 19 questions in 45 minutes. There was such a fuss about this a few years ago that the government, under public pressure, agreed to a system of seven questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now find that we are lucky to get through seven questions from our side&mdash;a total of 14&mdash;in about an hour or 1 1/4 hours. That was really unheard of when we first arrived back at the beginning of 1985. These lengthening answers have been accompanied by a change in the nature of the answers to the extent that, more and more, ministers believe that the House is just a forum for the most base party politics as opposed to the longstanding conventions and practices of the House that question time should be a time at which ministers, in particular, must account to the House for their actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not come down in the last shower. Obviously there will be a fair amount of reference to party political matters in question ttime. I am not saying that there should not be. But it has now come to pass that, from the point of view of an objective observer of the proceedings of the parliament, there is nothing untoward in the opposition also being given a chance during question time to get up and tip a bucket in return on the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to you, Mr Speaker&mdash;and this is my remark, if you like&mdash;that the reason why that has now come to pass is that, quite frankly, the way in which we now conduct question time has been so debased that people find that this is an entirely acceptable way in which the parliament should run. As I say, it is therefore really not exceptional that a question should be asked of the Leader of the Opposition because, from the public's point of view, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is dishing it out day in and day out, so why should not the opposition also be given a reasonable turn?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think I would have said this 10 years ago. I must say that, for the future, I am not sure that that really is the best way for the parliament to be run. In fact, I would have to say to you, Mr Speaker, that I do not think that, generally speaking, question time should be used entirely and completely in the party political way that it is now. When we first arrived, it was common place for private members to ask their own questions. Rarely is that the case now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole thing has to be managed. We have to manage it because that is the politics of the situation. The government has to manage it because that is the politics of the situation from its perspective. But we have arrived at this new low in the way in which the parliament is run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not let those who have a different point of view criticise me for being naive about politics. I am fully cognisant of the political pressures. That is why we acquiesce in what is happening. But it should not be allowed to pass unremarked that these changes have evolved over a period of time; so much so that the idea of the opposition regularly asking the Leader of the Opposition a question is not unremarked nor unremarkable. Page 514 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Standing Order 143 provides that questions may be put to a Member, who is not a Minister or an Assistant Minister, relating to any bill, motion or other public matter connected with the business of the House, of which the Member has charge.</PARA>
<PARA>The government is removing the bill because it is a nuisance to have the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) asking the Leader of the Opposition a question. It irks the Prime Minister considerably to have the Leader of the Opposition standing here and giving as good as he gets. It irks the Prime Minister a lot. As a result, he is removing this bill from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that, in the past, many a private member's bill has just sat on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and that is all there is to it. It disappears effectively with the effluxion of time with the dissolution of the parliament. If we look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House Magazine</EMPHASIS> we see that it is full of private members' bills&mdash;particularly in the Senate&mdash;that are just sitting there and going nowhere. No-one moves to remove them from the list. Why? The real reason this bill is being removed is the political embarrassment for the government on the issue of the Leader of the Opposition properly taking the opportunity provided by the standing orders and the conventions of standing up and answering reasonable questions about his proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the remedy to what I believe are the inadequate circumstances into which the House has now fallen is not so much a change in the standing orders but that the government of the day more properly respect the former conventions and traditions of this place. That starts with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister at the start of question time should say to his ministers, `When you are asked a question, I expect you to answer the question and be accountable. Question time should fulfil its proper purpose.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly what will happen when we are in government. We will abolish this rotten roster system which is used to allow ministers to have a rostered day off twice a week. It is unbelievable that ministers have days off. It is not as though they are not here in the building, as we have seen in many divisions which are called straight after question time. Take the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). She would not be here in question time to answer a few basic questions about her responsibility for the health care of millions of Australians but, as soon as there is a division after question time, all of a sudden she is here. She puts down her cup of tea and walks into the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as though this system was devised so ministers could get out and be in touch with the Australian community; it was devised as a political ploy to protect ministers. The roster system will be abolished by us. As the Leader of the Opposition has made very clear, we will require ministers to front every day and answer questions. In fact, I reckon it is not too much for the public to ask&mdash;that in the 22 weeks or thereabouts of the year that parliament sits ministers should be there on duty, should be responsible, should be accountable and should be ready to answer questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst on that topic, I must say that one of the other many aspects which have resulted in the diminution of the standing of the parliament is that these people changed the hour of question time knowing that the ABC prefer to run <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sesame Street</EMPHASIS> rather than question time in the House of Representatives, thereby ensuring that the House of Representatives question time is not broadcast concurrently with the happenings in the House. That is wrong. When you think about it, it is an amazing thing that the proceedings of the House in question time&mdash;the most important time of the day&mdash;are not broadcast in Australia because the Prime Minister changed the time so they would clash with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sesame Street</EMPHASIS> and the ABC would then give priority to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sesame Street</EMPHASIS> over the functionings of our parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not because we want to be on TV, I can tell you. I am entirely casual about that from a personal point of view. The point is that the public are entitled to know what is going on. They are entitled to see what is happening in their own parliament. They pay for it. This is a democracy. In a democracy, freedom of choice for people is little choice if it is not an informed choice. You might say that this is only a small matter. The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) is sighing. It is a matter of complete indifference to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason they changed that timing of question time in parliament was that the Prime Minister and his advisers did not want anybody to see his conduct in the House. So the Prime Minister made sure that question time was not televised. That is basically what has happened. People should know that. It is one of the many things along the way which cumulatively have affected the way in which the parliament operates and question time in particular. I must say that it is to the disadvantage of the standing of this parliament in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those few words, we will not specifically call for a division on this procedural matter, but it does highlight the way in which this government treats the parliament&mdash;the contempt with which it treats it. On the substantive matter, it highlights its embarrassment, after 12 1/2 years, of failing to act on this aspect of the curfew at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I rise frequently to speak on these issues because, quite clearly, and I think I have demonstrated it over time, I have a commitment to this parliament and its responsibility to the people of Australia. This particular motion is just another example of the arrogant treatment of this parliament by this executive, typified of course by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he told us that question time was a courtesy extended to the parliament or to the opposition by the executive. In other words, he did not even believe in that most fundamental of Westminster principles, that there should be a question time, whilst all responsible commentators around the world have made the point time and time again&mdash;and the WA Inc. royal commissioners spent quite a considerable part of their report on the fact&mdash;that question time is the time when the public is entitled to information and the opposition of the day is entitled to test the government on its policies and its probity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standing orders also provide, quite correctly, in that process that should a member, not of the executive&mdash;and I repeat that, a member not of the executive; in other words, a backbencher in the government ranks or any person in the opposition ranks&mdash;propose a private member's bill to the parliament, then they have the right to respond to questions from the members in that regard. Those questions might assist them in promoting their bill. They might be questions that identify great weaknesses in the bill, but it is all part of the function of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we see this government come scurrying in here with its tail between its legs wanting to wipe this particular piece of legislation off the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice paper</EMPHASIS>, it can only indicate that, firstly, this is a continuation of their disregard for the Westminster system and the conduct of this parliament and, more importantly, how terrified they are of giving the opportunity to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, to stand in this place and demonstrate his political skills, his clear understanding of issues, and his determination to represent the interests of the people of his electorate and the people of New South Wales, more particularly Sydney, in terms of the difficulties this government has created in regard to the Sydney airport debacle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a debacle ever since this government came into office. At first they had no solution, so we saw the ridiculous situation of aircraft being stacked up in the sky for hours. We saw tonnes of fuel and tonnes of gas emissions being extruded, if you like&mdash;certainly coming from aircraft&mdash;as aircraft waited at the end of the runway for their turn to take off. Then we saw them arrange for a parallel runway which everybody called the third runway&mdash;and I repeat that, the third runway. The Prime Minister and others have referred to it in recent times as the third runway, but then they turned around and made it the second runway. Then they did not even have their particular control processes in place to ensure that it would be run properly. They seemed unable to use Botany Bay in a way that would reduce the noise. They are still trying to make up their minds as to approach levels, notwithstanding that air navigation experts have told them there are better ways to bring aircraft into airports of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been an administrative disaster which has never even included any formalisation of the curfew arrangements. So, when the Leader of the Opposition brings forward such a proposal by the appropriate mechanism of a private member's bill, we find the government running around trying to produce the same bill but wanting to make it look different. That is ludicrous, and that is what this gets down to. When you get the allegation that what you are doing is silly, when you will not accept a very appropriate proposition because the people presenting it are in opposition, you are not governing the country properly. That is what has happened. There has been the embarrassment, on two occasions, of questions being put to the Leader of the Opposition. Having heard the arguments in crystal clarity from one of the best parliamentary operators in this country, the government has a little meeting, the executive gets together, and they say, `This is causing us harm; the people are listening and believing.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) throws his head around. If you don't believe that, why are you pulling it off the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> via this mechanism? The reason is that it is hurting, you are embarrassed and you know that the Leader of the Opposition is right. Please do not confect yawns and all these other things because, if it is not and was not having an effect&mdash;if it was not embarrassing you&mdash;you would not be doing what we are doing now: you would be getting on with your legislation, which may be of more importance to the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the shadow minister for employment and industrial relations, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), made the point quite clearly that all of this has built up over a period of time to demean the parliament. Would you not think a government that makes so many outrageous claims as to its ability to manage and to govern would be delighted to be on direct television at question time? Would you not think it would be proud of that? Why does it hide it away and ensure that question time is not seen until 1 o'clock in the morning? It is the government's question time. Why is it necessary to ban the rebroadcast of points of order, a fundamental process in question time, a fundamental part of the parliamentary process? Why would the government do that other than because it causes it some embarrassment? It might highlight to the people that the questions that it receives as a government are not properly answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went through a process a little while ago where the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) either could not remember or refused point blank to give an answer that was in any way relevant to the question she had been asked. Of course she did not want that to be shown on television by direct broadcast. Of course those opposite did not want a direct broadcast that would ensure that those points of order so properly taken, so frequently referring the government to the fact that it was not answering the question&mdash;which would in most cases have had considerable interest to the general community of Australia&mdash;were seen by members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple solution was, first, to ban the rebroadcasting by any means on television of points of order, and, more importantly, to make sure that the whole process of the federal House of Representatives question time was relegated to 1 o'clock in the morning. By conducting question time at the usual hour of 2 o'clock, it would have been broadcast direct on the ABC, and many people who have discussed that time with me would be watching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is that the standing orders provide for this mechanism. The standing orders provide for a private member's bill for all members of this House. It is not appropriate to have justice in the numbers, to wipe a bill out by this mechanism. It indicates a government in great fear of the skills of the Leader of the Opposition, of the legislation he has proposed and of the fact that he might respond to a further question coming from some part of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the minister that, as far as I know&mdash;and I have not studied the standing orders&mdash;there is nothing to stop him asking the Leader of the Opposition about his legislation. Surely the minister can pick some holes in it with all his political skills. If he cannot, it must be very good legislation. Why is he not asking the Leader of the Opposition a question and using the proper forms of this House to expose the weakness that might exist? It does not; it is just something the government should have done years ago. That has been made patently clear. As a consequence, the government is embarrassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that consequently this is an outrageous proposition. It is totally unnecessary and it is certainly not something that a good government should be frightened of. The government should be able to handle it with facts, not with insults and things that we have to hide from the Australian people by not putting question time on direct telecast. We hide all that and then also, as has been pointed out, have a situation where, if a minister gets an embarrassing question, the minister is not present the next day to allow the opposition to follow it up. The whole thing is seen as a perception of never giving a sucker a break. This is all about the `game' of politics; it has nothing to do with the rights of the millions of Australians out there who would like to be reassured that their country is being properly managed, that the managers of the finances are honest and capable and that we are not getting too far into debt&mdash;all those things that arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is through private members' bills of this nature that frequently a member is able to demonstrate beyond doubt that they have a commitment to certain issues of which the community is concerned. It is almost unbelievable that a government would be so frightened and so embarrassed that it has to come in here and spend the time of the House going through a process simply to remove an embarrassment from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. If you are big enough, strong enough and good enough, there is no need whatsoever, but you have demonstrated that there is a need. You have only one response to the nationwide, and certainly New South Wales-wide, criticism of your handling of the Sydney airport affair: to ensure that there is no opportunity to talk about it in any serious way through this sort of private member's bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a problem and one that brings no credit to this government at all. It is unnecessary if you were any good. The fact that you are not is why you are so embarrassed by the existence of this particular piece of legislation and the opportunity it gives to the Leader of the Opposition to answer questions properly put to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The stunt value of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) having this private member's motion continue to lie on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> has been well and truly exposed in the debate here this afternoon in this motion for its disposal, particularly by the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who indicated that the government was only proceeding to remove the Sydney Airport Curfew (Air Navigation Amendment) Bill 1995 because it was a nuisance and irksome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal to remove the bill is because it has already been enacted with a great number of enhancements&mdash;enhancements brought about as a result of the very timely intervention of the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson), who sought to have the private member's bill referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, a committee which reported on a good number of measures that would strengthen the effect of curfew. This was music to the ears of government, particularly as the proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition proposed nothing other than to legislate the existing regulations&mdash;that is, every rule and every regulation that was already in place and being given effect to every day in the procedures adopted at the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the work of the standing committee and as a result of the government's bill subsequently introduced, the bill is greatly enhanced with the reduction in quotas for international passenger movements during the curfew shoulder periods, not included in the private member's bill; greatly enhanced with the measures which propose that on Saturday and Sunday we will see aircraft operations between six and seven in the morning and 10 and 11 at night required to take off and land over the bay unless weather and traffic density prevent safe operations over the water; enhanced to the extent that all departures after 10.45 p.m. will be required to take off over Botany Bay to ensure that aircraft are well clear of residential suburbs by 11 o'clock; enhanced with the new provisions that larger propeller-driven aircraft over 34,000 kilograms, maximum take-off weight, will no longer be allowed to operate during the curfew; enhanced as a result of the more comprehensive consultation procedures which now require full community input into all curfew decisions with a requirement for full public scrutiny of any proposals to amend the legislation; and enhanced again with the provisions that increased penalties for breaches of the curfew will rise from $25,000 to $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these measures that I have mentioned were not included in Mr Howard's private member's bill which, I repeat, only recited the existing regulation.

<PARA>The Airports Bill provides for major reforms to the operation, development and regulation of federal airports. It is a bill founded upon the significant investment made in Australia's airports in recent years. Indeed, since 1988, the Federal Airports Corporation has greatly enhanced most of the airports it presently operates. In this period, the most notable changes have been capacity increases at Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport, international terminal improvements at Sydney and Melbourne, new terminals for Alice Springs and Darwin, supporting work for domestic terminal improvements around Australia and, most recently, a grand new international terminal at Brisbane airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC has completed all these works on a commercial basis, without any recourse to budget funding. As a result of their completion, FAC airports are better placed to meet both current demand and forecast increases in this demand. They are well set for the next phase of their operation under private leasing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Future Operational Responsibility for Airports</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With much of the infrastructure enhanced, the government announced in Working Nation last year that it would develop a new regulatory regime for airports and conduct a scoping study into the possible sale of the corporation's airports. Following endorsement of those plans at last year's ALP National Conference, the government decided to proceed with sales by way of 50-year leases, with options for a further 49 years. The bill requires government approval for the issuing of these options. It also dictates that each lessee be a company set up to operate the airport, and that there be only one company assuming each lease. Where a group owns more than one airport the separate airport companies may have a common holding company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to lease the airports underlines the strategic importance of the airports managed by the FAC, and the public interest considerations associated with them. The use of long-term leases means that the Commonwealth will maintain ownership of the airports and that leased airports remain Commonwealth places. It also supports continuation of Commonwealth regulatory control of the airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget this year the government announced its leasing strategy. That strategy opted for the leasing of FAC airports in two stages, with the four major airports&mdash;Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth&mdash;leased in the first phase, a phase in which Sydney will be jointly leased with the new airport at Badgerys Creek, Sydney West airport. The latter decision reflected the outcome of market testing and overseas experience which suggested that multi-airport systems were far more successful when developed on a complementary rather than competitive basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's intention is for the first stage to be completed by the end of 1996, with the second stage involving the remaining FAC airports taking place throughout 1997-98. This timetable is now jeopardised by coalition threats to excise Sydney from the first phase of the leasing process. Such threats amount to economic blackmail, pure and simple. Worse still, they are nothing short of economic lunacy on the part of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leasing strategy was designed to ensure maximum bidding and price tension, and therefore return to the taxpayer, by putting all the most attractive assets on the block first. If the most attractive asset, Sydney, was withheld, cross-ownership restrictions would ensure that bids would either not occur or would be far below the real value of Perth, Melbourne and Brisbane airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, if the present leasing strategy, a strategy recommended to the government by the best expertise of outside consultants and recommended on the basis of feedback from potential bidders, is blocked by the Senate, the entire leasing process will of necessity be put on hold. As a result, the aspirations of Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide for new airport operators will be frustrated by the economic irresponsibility of the federal coalition. In addition, work on the upgrading of Adelaide airport's main runway will also be delayed as funds for this project are predicated on the leasing of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the value of Sydney airport itself is depreciated by the coalition proposal to make its leasing conditional on an intersecting runway configuration, a configuration involving dependent cross-runway jet operations. According to Air Services Australia, this would cut Sydney's capacity by up to 35 per cent while guaranteeing that the airport is operated in a manner that does not maximise safety. Again, in the interests of protecting the taxpayer and flying public, the government cannot accept such a naked attempt to vandalise the process.

Under the government's leasing timetable, the target date for completion of the first stage of Sydney West is the end of 1999. To meet this target, the government has approved planned expenditure of nearly $1 billion on the airport and associated transport links. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overseas experience has demonstrated that, despite the high level of public interest in airport operations, with appropriate regulatory oversight the government no longer needs to manage the commercial operation of airports.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I need to say that the government seems to pursue in its second reading speech on the Airports Bill and the Airports (Transitional) Bill its policy of confuse and abuse. The preliminary part of the speech by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) dealt with the foreshadowed amendments of the opposition, which I will be moving when we consider the bills in detail, relating to the excising of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport from privatisation until such time as the question of the noise burden over Sydney is dealt with in an equitable and fair manner and there is a resumption of full operation of the east-west runway at that airport. The minister has tried to paint a picture of this being an amendment which will prevent subsequent airports being sold. He also brought up the old furphy of the reopening of the east-west runway being something which is unsafe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To begin with, we might just put a few quotes on the record concerning the safety question. Where else but to begin with Mr W. Pollard, the new CEO designate of Air Services Australia, who on 29 September said this about whether or not it was safe to have crossing runways:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout the world and in my past experience, there are many airports that have intersecting runways and they are used quite safely. In fact, many airports do not have parallel runways but usually have one north-south and one east-west and many times they are intersecting and it is done safely.</PARA>
<PARA>Another quote that is available came from the Regional Airlines Association of Australia in a media release, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two largest independent regional airlines operating in New South Wales, Hazelton and Tamair, today called on the federal government to reopen the east-west runway and implement long overdue changes to air traffic management procedures. If the east-west runway was used to interleave aircraft arrivals and departures, it would be far safer than the major congestion caused when arrivals are occurring from the north, as aircraft from the south and west approaching Sydney airport currently intersect in the air with aircraft arriving from the north.</PARA>
<PARA>Currently, we have intersecting runways in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. As I have said to the minister before, how is it that we in Sydney are supposed to be so much less smart than the people who operate those intersecting runways in other cities, or is it that our safety in Sydney is supposed to be more important than that of people in other cities? It is clearly a nonsense argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move to the bills themselves. Let me say again right from the outset that there are many problems with the bills. As to the nature of the drafting, I would point out that we originally saw an exposure draft. Then would-be bidders were put to a lot of effort in putting in submissions, which were basically ignored by the time we saw the bills, which came in only on the last sitting day of the last sitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to point out that today, as we came into the chamber to debate the bills, the governments themselves have issued some amendments to the transitional bill which also will be moved, I presume, when we consider the bills in detail. But this again just shows the lack of planning on the part of the government with regard to its undertaking of the whole privatisation program. Its desperate greed and grasp for money when it flogs off the assets of Australia and then just spends the proceeds is something that I think Australians have to be aware of. Yes, the coalition is certainly committed to the privatisation of airports and of the FAC, but we believe that a condition precedent with regard to Kingsford Smith airport is not something that can be swept under the carpet and must be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment that I foreshadow I will be moving when we consider the bills in detail relates to the airport at Adelaide. The government has chosen to say that Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane are the major airports; it has insulted Adelaide and, indeed, discriminated against it as the only other mainland state capital airport that should not be included in the first stage of sales. So I will also be moving an amendment to include Adelaide on the list of airports that are set out in the transitional legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the transitional bill, in fact, is the mechanism which enables the government to lease all the federal airports as ongoing businesses, with most staff and management in place, under a two-stage sale process. Those airports which are listed in the bill itself are immediately subject to the legislation. All other airports are not subject to the legislation, until such time as regulations are passed to include them or make them subject to the legislation. Indeed, the whole framework of the two bills is merely skeletal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real essence of how the airports are to be regulated, the conditions and terms of the sales are all to be set out in regulations&mdash;and we have not seen those regulations. Not only have we not seen the regulations but we are not due, apparently, to see them until next February. I understand that undertakings have been given by the government to would-be bidders that they could expect to see them come in in February, and this would give until the end of June, which of course would be after the election, time for them to consider their position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the one big complaint of almost all people who are associated with this whole privatisation process has been the fact that the enabling legislation is so sketchy. It is the unknown regulations that we are yet to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you an example of how important documentation can be to this whole process. Because of the standing orders in this place, when the bills came in on a first reading, we did not get a second reading speech, obviously. Here, if a bill is introduced with a second reading speech, the debate must proceed. I understand that that was brought in in order to make the explanatory memorandum explain all the intent of the bill. Well, of course, it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that was missing from the bill was the very serious question which the minister did address in his second reading speech&mdash;and, interestingly enough, when courts are considering legislation and ancillary papers, it is the explanatory memorandum that has standing rather than his speech&mdash;when he said that the new airport operators would be required to make in lieu payments for taxes, as the Commonwealth does under a COAG agreement, but for which there is no other obligation to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is silent on that point. We had presumed that the matter would be dealt with by way of either regulation or in the lease itself. And, of course, we the public are unlikely to see the lease because it will be deemed commercial in confidence. So, again, it is important to raise the arguments concerning transparency and whether or not legislation is good or bad legislation when so much is still concealed or unknown at the time of debate of the primary legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I would like to look at some of the specific problems raised with me and with others in the period of looking at the nature of these bills and what sort of attitude we would have to them. Many problems have been identified, the most important of which is that the bills themselves make only part of the total picture. As one potential bidder stated, the bills are only the tip of the iceberg. The regulations, the leases, the decisions that the government is yet to make regarding the debts of the FAC, the price control mechanism and the quality service monitoring to be undertaken by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will present the full picture. The basic problem is that the government is proposing to legislate by way of legislation. The bill, as I said, is only part&mdash;the major details being left to be filled in by way of that regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is concern that third parties, such as airlines and concessionaires, may be affected by those other ancillary actions of regulations and leases, some of which will never be seen, yet they will never know the terms and conditions. So we already have a lack of certainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drafting of the regulations, I understand, will begin in November 1995. There has been an assurance from the government to potential bidders that the regulations will be drafted in portions, each portion subject to consultation, as the bills were&mdash;although I hope more attention will be paid to the consultation&mdash;and that the whole will be in place in February 1995 before the sale process begins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be a firm government assurance that the regulations are in place before the sale process begins. Also the government needs to give an undertaking that they will be in accordance with the Legislative Instruments Bill which was introduced into this place in November 1994 but which is still in the Senate. Basically, that bill requires that there will be a mandatory consultation process for all delegated legislation affecting businesses. This process would include the provision of a legislative instrument proposal which analysed the need for the instrument, its costs and benefits and alternative means of achieving those objects. This would ensure that any defects in the proposal are exposed and can be corrected before the instrument is made. Secondly, all registrable legislative instruments would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. It is very important that subordinate legislation is subject to parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This act, which has still not been passed, will replace all existing provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act that refer to legislative instruments and enact its own provisions, which include the power of both houses to defer consideration of a motion of disallowance of a legislative instrument for up to six months. Currently, it is 15 sitting days. This will allow the rule maker to remake or amend the instrument to achieve an object specified by resolution of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important then, Minister, that you give an undertaking that the regulations will be in accordance with those principles. This would give a degree of accountability. And this process, I might add, was adopted with regard to civil aviation regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Airports Bill provides for four methods of controlling the use of airports by aircraft once the leasing process is complete and gives the minister reserve powers in demand management at airports. These powers and these decisions are unappealable. The bill enables the minister to formulate a demand management scheme for an airport specifically in these four categories: the category exclusion schemes, slot allocation, movement limitation schemes, and anything else they like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before formulating a demand management scheme, the minister is required to declare that the airport is subject to a statutory demand management and declare the capacity of an airport after having received submissions from interested parties regarding the capacity of the airport and taken due regard of any submission received. Nice words. But the important point that needs to be made is that the ultimate declaration powers of the minister cannot be appealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is considerable objection to this when the only reason being given is that airlines require certainty in bookings, which are taken up to six months in advance. These unappealable reserve powers will considerably diminish the appetite for bidders and for the purchase price&mdash;something the minister has already spoken about as one of his great concerns. Ideally, the legislation should have made provision for non-discriminatory access and for an appeal mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some argue that the category exclusion scheme should only be at the request of the airport operator. Movement limitation schemes: as the airport operators' consent is not required, potential bidders again find this unacceptable, unless compensation is paid to the airport operator for loss incurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the slot allocation scheme, the airport operator, the air traffic controllers and the airlines must be involved in and/or manage any slot allocation scheme, but this is not provided for specifically. There is a feeling that the government should not be involved in this process as they do not have any expertise. However, it is relevant to note that in the final bill there is provision made for a person to be a slot coordinator. The airport operator is not precluded from fulfilling this role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point is that there is no clear definition of the concept of capacity. This is important when considering that the minister retains the power to make capacity declarations in the final bill. Capacity, of course, goes right to the heart of the value of the airport. There is a fear that the airport capacity may be scaled down, thus reducing the potential income of any airport operator. In the event of this occurring, there has been some suggestion that compensation should be paid for potential loss of income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, again, does not provide for specific consultation with airlines, although clause 186 does allow for public submissions to be prepared by interested parties regarding the capacity of the airport in question. Neither does it require an expert opinion to guide the minister when he takes his decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further important point in relation to part 5 is that the airport is required to have a final master plan, the contents of which shall be outlined in the regulations&mdash;once again, the unknown regulations, although the bill does outline the inclusion of some details such as the airport operators' development objectives and the way they see the future needs of civil aviation users of the airport and for services and facilities relating to the airport. These plans are to relate to a period of 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Points that are made by those who are involved is that the breadth required to be included in this master plan is very wide and may involve disclosing confidential information to the public. It was recommended by potential bidders to include only a major plan. This was not changed in the final bill, although the term for the master plan has been reduced from 25 years to 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, there is a major development plan requirement. Provision is made, again in the unknown regulations, to outline what is to be included in the major development plan. There is a list of requirements to be included in the regulations, such as airport lessee companies' objectives for the development, a detailed outline of the development and their assessment of the extent to which the future need of civil aviation users of the airport are met by the development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some feeling that the details required to be included in the major development plan may be unnecessary. Potential bidders have indicated that they feel major development plans should only include runways, new and major extensions, new passenger terminals, significant extensions to passenger terminals and major non-aeronautical developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minor aeronautical activity, such as taxiways and internal roads, are a function of capacity and therefore are caught by the airport master plan process, so they should not have to be included in the major development plan. This was not remedied in the final bill and the definition was expanded to include the construction of any new buildings where the building is not wholly or principally for the use of a passenger terminal such as multilevel car parks. Many things are of concern to future bidders, who are really only seeing half the picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that is raised and requires very serious consideration is price regulation and quality service monitoring. The Airports Bill 1995 provides for regulations to be established which may specify performance indicators to be used in monitoring and evaluating the quality of airport services and the facilities of the ACCC at regulated airports including the ACCC being able to publish reports on quality of service matters. It also gives the ACCC a power over prices regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prices Surveillance Authority, which is to be subsumed by the ACCC&mdash;and it was supposed to occur in July but has still not yet been gazetted&mdash;had a discussion paper included in the legislative package. It is a discussion about price regulation, quality of service and the sorts of tests that may be used, particularly one of price capping. Currently, it is only that&mdash;a discussion paper. The government should have the issue of prices regulation established well and truly by the time the sales process begins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commercial return particularly is linked to the regulatory framework. Changes to the framework or the imposition of additional requirements and restrictions could cause financial detriment to the airport lessee company. This is a risk that has to be factored in by any potential bidder. It has been suggested by potential bidders that the bill be amended to ameliorate the risk of financial detriment by providing compensation to be paid in case of financial detriment caused by government regulatory change. This has occurred in GBE legislation in the form of financial detriment clauses and in section 70 of the agreement with Optus Communications. So there is precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill itself contains detailed provisions for remedying a situation where a lessee company becomes bankrupt. However, it is silent as to how it will ensure that lessees are economically viable whilst retaining the lease. This detail could be found in the lease. However, this means that affected parties, such as airlines, have no access to these terms and, again, we can have uncertainty for tenants within the airport itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the lessee company remains viable and strong, enabling the company to be able to respond quickly when expansion is required or when technology requires updating. It has been suggested that this requirement may be added to the criteria found in the bill itself and that the minister may take into account when making the decision of the granting of the lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to the interesting question of debt. Part 10 of the Airports (Transitional) Bill outlines the treatment of the Federal Airports Corporation's debts. No final decision has been made by the Commonwealth regarding the debts of the FAC. Negotiations are still continuing. The bill outlines that the government keeps the following options open unto itself. What it is basically doing is saying that it may forgive large amounts of debt, as it did with Qantas Airways&mdash;$1.3 billion, if my memory serves me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions that the government reserves unto itself are these: the Treasurer may call up a loan made by the Commonwealth to the FAC; the Commonwealth may take over the FAC's obligations under a loan made to the FAC by a person other than the Commonwealth; the Commonwealth may give the FAC money to enable the FAC to discharge a loan made by the FAC by a person other than the Commonwealth. Essentially, the Commonwealth will step in with two standing appropriations to cover the FAC's debts to the Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth lenders. In the case of a non-Commonwealth lender to the FAC, the obligation is converted into a Commonwealth obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another standing appropriation which is a capital advance to the Federal Airports Corporation. It will remain as an operational body through this whole process which, under the government's plan&mdash;I stress it is post-election&mdash;is meant to be continued until as late as 1998. There is provision for a capital advance to the FAC to carry on, pending competition of any sale by the Commonwealth of a Commonwealth owned company which is a lessee. There is very serious concern about the open-endedness of these three appropriations. The government should be able to make some sort of estimate regarding these figures and then place a statutory cap on the appropriations. Without this cap, the  appropriations are almost open-ended, and it is taxpayers' money that it is spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no indication regarding the allocation of the FAC's debts to each airport, including a $400 million abnormal debt in the 1994 FAC annual report. The FAC as a corporation holds an overall level of debt to the value of $987 million, yet these liabilities have not been allocated to any individual airport. These are important issues as, depending on the level of debt of each airport, airports will be more attractive or less attractive to potential bidders. The government has indicated that, for the most part, borrowings can be linked to specific work projects and that there has been very little network wide borrowing by the FAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further important point is foreign ownership. The schedules of the bill set out a 49 per cent foreign ownership limit, a five per cent airline ownership limit and a 15 per cent cross-ownership limit with regard to the three airports of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. The bill does have a definition of a `foreign entity'. But apparently the government has learnt little from its Qantas experience. There is no provision in the legislation which would prevent an airport falling into foreign hands&mdash;just as Qantas did. It was unknown for some three weeks whether or not the foreign component of Qantas had been oversubscribed. All remedies contained in this bill are after the event remedies not pre-event remedies, yet there are readily available remedies that could ensure that airports did not fall into foreign hands, as Qantas did when the foreign ownership level went as high as 53 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to taxation levels, the bill sets out that state government duties are not to be paid on transactions between the Commonwealth and itself, but potential buyers of course will be obliged to pay duty on any transfers for their own transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important aspect of the bill is the environmental management section. Statutory liens, variations and closures of airport sites, rates payable&mdash;which, as I said, the minister has only deigned to address in his second reading speech&mdash;and cross-subsidisation of major airports are all issues which remain unsatisfactorily addressed by the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Airports Bill provides that a draft environmental strategy will be prepared having due regard to public comment, but it will be for ministerial approval. For each regulated airport, there is to be a final environmental strategy&mdash;again, to be approved by the minister. Regulations may deal with pollution aspects of airports&mdash;but, again, the power resides with the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to statutory liens, potential bidders are concerned that the operator should have statutory protection to recover its airport charges from airline operators for non-payment of airport landing charges&mdash;which the government enjoys itself. The bill further provides for an airport lessee company to be consulted before an airport site is varied or closed, and airport lessee companies may surrender an airport lease to the Commonwealth unconditionally or on such terms as are agreed. Concern was raised over the fact that no provision was made for airlines to be consulted. If airports are to be closed or varied, their flight plans will be varied or terminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of cross-subsidisation of major airports is one that has been raised particularly by governments in South Australia and Western Australia, where there is concern with the fact that there are no cross-ownership limits between the major airports of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. There is concern in Tasmania as well that the airports in Launceston and Hobart could be operated by the same operators and competition could be lessened. The concern is that some of those smaller airports could be used to cross-subsidise the operations of the major ones, whose operations would perhaps be deemed to be more preferable. Again, the situation has not been clarified by the government and it would be good if they would clarify their position on those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return now to the important question of the amendments that we will be moving when we proceed to the consideration of the bills in detail. We will be moving five amendments to the Airports Bill and five amendments to the Airports (Transitional) Bill. The effect of those amendments will be to excise Kingsford Smith airport from the privatisation provisions so that the privatisation will be postponed, effectively, until such time as the aircraft noise burden over Sydney is more equitably and more fairly shared and the resumption of full operation of the east-west operation at Sydney is accomplished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We realise that the bill provides, through regulation, that the government could restore Kingsford Smith airport according to the list set out in the transitional bill, but we have provided for that by moving that the regulations may not so restore Kingsford Smith until such time as those requirements as to fairness and equity and the reopening of the east-west runway have been achieved. Adelaide is, as I said, also important, and we can see no reason why South Australia should be discriminated against in this way. I noticed on page 2 of the minister's second reading speech that he deigned to include concern for Adelaide, but I do not see in his amendments to be moved any attempt to include Adelaide in that first stage of sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that the opposition's position is very clear. We favour the privatisation of the Federal Airports Corporation and thereby the privatisation of the airports, but we do not believe that it can be done without addressing the important question of the noise over Sydney caused presently by shutting the east-west runway and by other managerial arrangements implemented by the current Minister for Transport. It is within the power of the minister to address&mdash;today, if he wishes&mdash;those concerns of the opposition. He can start to address those questions of noise and their equitable solutions and their equitable treatment straightaway. We are quite firm that, unless our amendments are agreed to, we will oppose the legislation. </PARA>

The member for Mackellar has outlined her amendments to the airports bills to the effect that the leasing of Kingsford Smith airport should not proceed until such time as the east-west runway is reopened. That is only half the story that the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, was putting to the parliament and the public in his press release dated 26 September. That is when he announced the joint party decision to defer the leasing of KSA not only until the east-west runway is reopened but also&mdash;and this is the part that was deleted by the member for Mackellar&mdash;until a genuine environmental impact statement on Badgerys Creek is completed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is only half the story, Minister, because the backflips have now been fourfold. First of all, the Leader of the Opposition was in favour of the genuine EIS at Badgerys Creek. Then he backflipped and said, `We really do not need an EIS; we are going to put all the international flights out at Badgerys Creek, take them all out of Kingsford Smith and direct them towards Sydney West.' Then there was another backflip when he announced, `We really did not want to do that; that was ill-considered.' He had not consulted anyone, and he went back to the position of wanting an EIS on Badgerys Creek. That was the announcement he made on 26 September, saying that the opposition would seek to move in the Senate that this legislation be deferred until such time as the east-west runway was reopened and there was a genuine EIS at Badgerys Creek.

That is something that is bound to cause the opposition a great deal of trouble. How would John Howard have been placed in that situation? Why did he announce it?' Then I read the press report further, and noticed that this was a recommendation put to the shadow cabinet by the member for Mackellar, the shadow minister at the table. </PARA>

I have seen the Liberal Party squirming their way across western Sydney on this Badgerys Creek airport issue for many years, going way back to 1986 when the announcement was made, but nothing compares with the events of recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of it has been reinforced by the debate here today when the shadow minister, against the express announcement of her leader on 26 September, has moved from a position of wanting a new EIS on Badgerys Creek to failing comprehensively to include that in her amendment to this legislation. No wonder I am dumbfounded and no wonder the shadow minister wants me to move on to other subjects. But I will be coming back, so she need not fret or get too upset at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill establishes a framework and foreshadows regulations for the private leasing of Australia's major airports. I must declare my support for this privatisation proposition. I do not regard airport ownership in Australia in the 1990s as part of the core responsibilities of the federal government. I would have thought that all parliamentarians here would be supporting the very strong revenue raising measures in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed earlier that the member for Mackellar was scoffing at the idea that privatisation would raise extra federal revenue. Does that mean she supports interest rate increases as a product of lost revenue? That would be one of the consequences of her amendment because the federal government and its fiscal framework would be denied the substantial financial benefits of the private leasing of Kingsford Smith airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No less an authority than Access Economics&mdash;well known to the opposition, being the co-authors of Fightback&mdash;has estimated as a rule of thumb that $4 billion of fiscal tightening achieves the same macro-economic impact as a one per cent increase in interest rates. By scoffing at the proposition, by moving her amendment, the shadow minister is basically saying that the federal opposition is willing to see interest rates rise as they tear apart the government's financial strategy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government stands for interest rate relief. I would have thought that, as a product of this amendment and the very clear fiscal outcomes that are implied in the shadow minister's amendment, the federal coalition stands for higher interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to privatisation. Not only are there revenue benefits but there are also benefits in rationalising the administration and the outcomes of airports in Australia. As has been well known for 20 years&mdash;but unknown to the shadow minister&mdash;the previous FAC regime had been into irrational and, indeed, improper cross-subsidisation of all of our major airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no equity argument in saying that privatisation should not proceed. The truth is that public ownership does not serve the interests of the working class in Australia when it comes to airports. From all my conversations in my electorate, people who come from a working background, who are meeting the challenges of finding a job and raising a family, are not interested so much in public ownership in the 1990s; their main preoccupation, their main concern, is with skills and opportunities rather than ownership&mdash;that is, trying to build the skills, economic and social, to cope with our post-industrial society, to overcome long-term unemployment, inter-generational unemployment, and to give themselves and their children the educational and lifestyle opportunities that are consistent with a good quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not seriously entertain the proposition that any of those working people would think that when they go to an airport it matters two hoots who owns the airport. Overseas there are very good models of how private leasing and private ownership can proceed in the public interest. I am a very strong supporter of the central propositions of the government's budget announcement and those contained in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am interested&mdash;and I touched on this earlier&mdash;in the motives behind the coalition in advancing this proposition that the private leasing of Kingsford Smith should not proceed until such time as the east-west runway has been reopened. It used to have a caveat&mdash;it used to be conditional on the Badgerys Creek EIS, but that is no longer the case following the speech by the member for Mackellar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine the motives behind this. Why is it that the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong, has announced so much policy? There has been a deluge of policy on airports. This is from an opposition that has tried to pride itself on being a policy free zone&mdash;not giving the government too much of a signal of its intentions for the next election. The strategy has been to hold policy back, except on airports. They have fired out more policy on airports than we have seen from any political party for many decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would that be? Why would the Leader of the Opposition make a huge exception when it comes to airports? The opposition has no policy on tax, industrial relations&mdash;that is still being worked out&mdash;welfare and changes to the budget framework. Why is it that airports have become the great exception? The answer is naked self-interest. The member for Bennelong must have been shaking in his boots when he read the results of the New South Wales state election. He saw where the anti-airport noise vote had been the highest and who suffered. The highest no airport noise vote in the New South Wales election was in the state electorate of Lane Cove. The primary vote was in Lane Cove, right in the middle of the federal electorate of Bennelong. Where did the Liberal Party lose the key seat? Right next door in Gladesville, also in the federal electorate of Bennelong. The Labor Party took the seat on the preferences of the No Airport Noise Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This all boils down to naked self-interest. The Leader of the Opposition has no greater motivation in this matter than to protect his own election, all at the expense of good policy making in the Sydney metropolitan basin, all at the expense of good policy making in the federal budget and all at the expense of good policy making for the management and leasing of Australia's airports. That is a great shame. It highlights one very important point: when the Leader of the Opposition reveals his policy the public can see that he is a dead loss and is hopeless on policy making. He is a lousy policy maker. That has been exposed by these backflips, somersaults, crash landings and aborted take-offs regarding his policies for Kingsford Smith and Badgerys Creek airports. But the self-interest is there and it reveals his skills as a policy maker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition and his shadow minister have absolutely no comprehension, no idea whatsoever, of how to make Badgerys Creek airport a success. They have no comprehension of how to successfully and, most importantly, safely reduce aircraft noise in the centre of Sydney. We are entitled to ask: what is new about the Leader of the Opposition as a flop on policy? You only need to go back to his time as Treasurer under the Fraser government when he walked away from financial deregulation, industrial relations reform and tariff reductions. He walked away from a complete package that would have internationalised the Australian economy and given it contemporary relevance in the world economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a conclusion to be drawn. How do we rate the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to policy. What are the public to make of all these things? His record as a Fraser government minister, and now on the one serious policy task of airports, is that of a complete failure. The truth is that he is the most overrated figure that Australian politics has seen for many decades. John Howard has given the illusion of being good at policy making, but on the public record he is a dead loss. He is totally overrated by the media and by his own party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has he ever achieved on these policy issues? Name one achievement of the Leader of the Opposition, one success story in policy making during his time as Leader of the Opposition in the mid-1980s or during his time as Fraser's Treasurer. I challenge the shadow ministers in the chamber, the member for Mackellar and the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), to name one success, one achievement, of John Howard as a policy maker. I think the silence says it all. There is nothing. Look at the period of the Fraser government and his time as Leader of the Opposition in the mid-1980s. And now his position on airports is an absolute disaster. He is either policy free or a policy flop. They are the only things the Australian people have ever seen from John Howard. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who said in his budget reply text on 11 May this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have dedicated my public life to the pursuit of substantive policy change and led the debate.</PARA>
<PARA>Where is the substantive policy change on airports? The policy is an absolute disaster. This is someone who is saying that he has led the policy debate but who is hiding all his policies for the next election. He is deferring them, putting them off. He is going to announce them at the very last minute. If they are good policies, if he is a policy leader, if he pursues policy change, he should be putting those policies out. If he was a good policy leader, he would be confident that his policies would have the support of the Australian people. That is not the case and I can guarantee you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and other members in the chamber that no-one in western Sydney has any confidence whatsoever in the record of the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;or, indeed, the entire Liberal Party&mdash;on the question of Badgerys Creek airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have got a list of the policy announcements by federal and state Liberals about this key  development  near  my  electorate  in the greater western Sydney region. It all goes back to the announcement of the second airport site in 1986. Then we had the election of a Liberal state government in New South Wales in 1988. They were there for seven years. In that time they did not lift a finger, they did not lift a pencil, they did not touch the planning map in Sydney which would have designated the corridor for the essential rail link between Kingsford Smith and Badgerys Creek airports. We are now still paying the penalty for seven years of inaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the same Liberal Party who were saying, `We really do not support Badgerys Creek airport; we do not want to see the rail link go in. We do not want to see the fast-tracking of the facility,' but who were wanting to go ahead with 100,000 new residential lots through the South Creek Valley. I know the member for Mackellar is from the North Shore beaches, and she might not be too aware of the location of South Creek Valley. It totally surrounds Badgerys Creek airport site. State Liberal policy was to build 100,000 new lots around this site for Sydney's second international airport. What a planning disaster that would have been. People in western Sydney talking about the noise impact of the new airport should thank themselves. Public opposition convinced the Liberal government that its plans for 100,000 new residential lots at South Creek Valley would have been an absolute disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My chronology then comes to January 1994. I turn to the federal arena. I had direct experience in this at the Werriwa by-election. Mr Charlie Lynn, the Liberal candidate, supported by the now Leader of the Opposition, taunted the Labor Party that we were not going ahead fast enough with Badgerys Creek airport and that consequently we were delaying employment growth in western Sydney. This is the same Mr Lynn who was the Liberal candidate for Macarthur, now disendorsed. In December 1994 Mr Lynn was saying that the fast-tracking of Badgerys Creek airport would lead to chaos and disaster and make a hellhole in Macarthur. As a product of these views, on 1 February this year the Leader of the Opposition committed a coalition government to reopening the east-west runway and fast-tracking Badgerys Creek airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another policy backflip highlighted the lack of consistency between the federal and state Liberal Party. On 20 March&mdash;the last days of the New South Wales election&mdash;the New South Wales environment minister, Chris Hartcher, said that Badgerys Creek airport is `the aviation future of New South Wales and should be built with two 4,000-metre runways instead of the current plan to build a single 2,900-metre runway.' At the last minute, in the dying days of the Fahey government, the coalition wanted to go from a 2,900-metre runway to two 4,000-metre runways at Badgerys Creek. On top of that, we have had all the backflips and the policy flops by the member for Mackellar and the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;whether it be international flights to Badgerys Creek, a new EIS or an amendment in this legislation. They have not been able to make up their minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, Charlie Lynn has now been disendorsed in Macarthur, where Badgerys Creek airport is located. Who is the new candidate? Who has been endorsed as the new Liberal Party candidate for Macarthur? It is John Fahey. John Fahey was at the scene of the crime of the terrible failure to plan for the rail link to Badgerys Creek airport. It took seven years, including three years of his premiership in New South Wales. They did not lift a finger or put a scratch on the planning map to even reserve the corridor for the rail line from Badgerys Creek to East Hills, let alone purchase the land on which the rail line would be constructed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Fahey, at the scene of the crime, as a former Premier of New South Wales, is now coming in as the Liberal candidate for Macarthur. It is a farce. This Liberal Party record on Badgerys Creek airport and their protests about noise consequences and the consistency of their policy making has been an absolute sham. I would only hope that it has done considerable damage to the Leader of the Opposition. We already knew that the shadow minister had no reputation as a policy maker. The people in western Sydney can draw the right conclusion&mdash;that is, that this outfit opposite is not fit to govern. They are not fit to administer airports, they are not fit to administer airport policy and they are not fit to look after major national issues such as the legislation now before the House because they are basically hopeless and incompetent, and the public record on these airport questions shows that so comprehensively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has given us, to use his own words, a hopeless speech in relation to the issues before the House this afternoon. His speech has solely dealt with the personalities involved in the debate rather than the substance of the debate. As typical of so many debates that we have had from the Labor Party here in Canberra over the last little while, its whole focus and attention is directed towards belittling individuals rather than trying to come up with constructive and substantive argument that addresses the issues that are important to Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process of trying to belittle other people&mdash;people on this side of the House or, indeed, people in the broader community&mdash;who dare question the credibility and veracity of the things that the government is saying, those opposite are ignoring these very important issues which mean so much to the people of Australia, in particular, in this instance to the people of Sydney, and going for the cheap and easy political target of personalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member for Werriwa was so confident that this opposition got its policy on Sydney airport so wrong and you have got your policy on Sydney airport so right, why does your Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) have to go around Sydney with bodyguards in a car with darkened windows so nobody can see in? I will tell you the reason why. It is because the people of Sydney hate him and his policies and your government because of what you have done to their city, their quality of life, their lifestyle, the value of their homes and their airport. That is why the people of Sydney dislike you and your government and your Minister for Transport and your Prime Minister (Mr Keating) so much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite do not have it right and the evidence of that can be found in all of those public meetings held in Sydney about this government's mismanagement of Sydney airport and about the noise problem created by the airport. That is why Sydney airport is blockaded on a regular basis. That is why we find the Minister for Transport, Laurie Brereton, being caught in back alleys as he tries to escape from public meetings in Sydney, why he is protected by bodyguards and why he is a most unpopular soul in Sydney at present. The reason that is so is because this government has its policy on Sydney airport so desperately wrong. For the honourable member for Werriwa or the Minister for Transport to be in this House saying that it is us that have got it wrong and it is them who have got it all right is extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask members of the government to go to Sydney and talk to people who are concerned about Sydney airport and just listen to what they have got to say. Your friend the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) will tell you that the people of Sydney are absolutely and utterly outraged at this government's incompetence about Sydney airport and about the dishonest approach that this government has taken in telling the people of Sydney the truth about the consequences of a third runway being built at Sydney's Mascot airport. They are absolutely outraged. If you speak to those people you will find that they blame this government for their problems, and their problems are enormous&mdash;absolutely and utterly enormous. </PARA>

Most people who live in suburbs like Hunters Hill, Drummoyne and many others throughout Sydney have seen the value of their principal asset&mdash;seen the value of their life's work&mdash;depreciated enormously by this government's dishonest and incompetent management of Sydney's Mascot airport and the noise problem that comes from it. </PARA>

But we can see, from the substance of the debate that we have just had, that the government does not want to address the issues&mdash;they want to address the personalities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process of privatisation, we will be handing over to some yet unknown buyer the future of Sydney, its airport and the people who are affected by the noise of the aircraft that fly into that airport. The Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and my colleague the shadow minister for privatisation, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), have said in the debate on this subject that we want to ensure that, before we hand over the destiny of Sydney's airport to somebody else&mdash;we do not know as yet whom that person will be&mdash;we want to resolve the noise problems of Sydney's Mascot airport. We think it is a fairly reasonable thing to do because we think that problem is so enormous and has such a huge impact on the quality of life and the lifestyle of people living in Sydney that it deserves to be fixed before we run for the money. </PARA>

Once we have that resolution, let us sell the airport. We have no problem with selling Sydney's airport, just as we have no problem with selling the other airports that the minister has indeed listed for sale under his legislation. We have no problem at all with that, but we just want to ensure that we make a fair go at fixing the problems of aircraft noise over Sydney before we sell Sydney's Mascot airport. Sell the others now if you like and add Adelaide to that list. We think it deserves to be on the list of first airports to be sold.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe there is a fair and equitable resolution to the aircraft noise problem to be obtained at Sydney's Mascot airport, and that is reopening Sydney's east-west runway&mdash;the runway that was closed by this government; the runway that was closed because of a political decision in 1989 determined by the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister. We have all now seen the evidence that confirms the fact that it was the Prime Minister of Australia, Paul J. Keating, who made and enforced through cabinet the decision to ensure that all air traffic at Sydney's Mascot airport operated on the north-south axis and that the east-west runway would be closed. He did that for primarily political reasons, as my colleague reminds me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard the honourable member for Werriwa go on about us for being political in this whole exercise. If politics are to be taken into account in this debate, the politics started in 1989 when the now Prime Minister said, `We'll close the east-west runway and have all of the air traffic operating on the north-south axis.' That was when the politics really started to come into play. As a consequence of that, the lifestyle of many tens of thousands of people in Sydney has been seriously eroded and the value of their houses, their principal asset in life, has been diminished&mdash;all because of that political decision made in 1989 by the now Prime Minister of Australia, Paul J. Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have to sit through a dishonest display by this government, which is trying to defend the indefensible: to keep the east-west runway closed.

They say, `We cannot possibly put the lives of people at Sydney's Mascot airport at risk, which reopening the east-west runway would do.'

We were told a fortnight or so ago, the last time we had a debate on this matter in this House, that people like Max Hazelton and the regional airlines of Australia did not want to reopen the full length of the east-west runway for normal operations. Indeed, it was interesting to note that that was a complete and deliberate deception. Max Hazelton and Tamair, which are the two biggest regional airline operators I think we have in New South Wales at present, both want and have stated on several occasions that they want&mdash;and restated on 28 September, a couple of weeks ago&mdash;the whole length of the east-west runway reopened. </PARA>

In fact, he says in his analysis of safety risks at Mascot airport with intersecting runways or parallel runways that it is twice as dangerous to operate parallel runway operations than it is to have an intersecting runway operation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on this important legislation&mdash;the Airports Bill and the Airports (Transitional) Bill&mdash;I want to address a couple of the major issues which it raises. In the late 1980s the government corporatised airport ownership and operations, with the objective of removing taxpayer subsidies to and improving the efficiency of airport operations. A close look at the operations of the Federal Airports Corporation shows that these objectives were only partially achieved. The reality is that very substantial implicit subsidies continue to exist, particularly at Sydney airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of these implicit subsidies was the absence of any recognition of the cost of noise on residents. I am glad to say that the noise tax arrangements introduced by the government have gone some way to redressing this issue. I note that there has been some criticism of the noise tax arrangements. I reject that criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These arrangements mean that for the first time the very substantial impact of noise on residents is being reflected in the pricing arrangements facing the people who cause that noise&mdash;the airlines and their customers. It is an example of the `polluter pays' principle at work. There ought to be more of it. Of course, they also mean that funding is available for practical measures to help some of those most severely affected by noise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implicit subsidies I referred to a moment ago also arose from the absence of proper competitive pressures on the Federal Airports Corporation, allowing there to be a wide range of irrational cross-subsidies in airport operation and mis-valuation of airport assets in the FAC's books. I welcome the fact that the unbundling of airport operations represented by this legislation will partly redress this issue too. But the benefits of the legislation do not stop there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For one thing&mdash;and I know this from my personal involvement as an ERC minister&mdash;there would not have been a decision to build Sydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek before the end of this decade if there had not also been a decision to lease the airports. This is because these bills create the possibility of a very innovative funding arrangement which completely protects the taxpayer from the risk of financing such a major piece of infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, these bills provide a substantial improvement in democratic control over airport development in this country. The fact is that the Federal Airports Corporation has been an out of control government quango. It has been exempt from the discipline of the marketplace and it has been exempt from proper democratic control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legislation, in contrast, the lessee must develop a master plan. Ministerial approval will be required for the master plan. Ministerial approval will be required for significant development projects. Ministerial approval will be required for environmental plans. And the minister will have the power to institute demand management arrangements. I believe that under this legislation the Commonwealth government will retain to itself the power to do everything that needs to be done to fix Sydney's airport problems. That is not the case under the current arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to what I believe those solutions to be. The government has decided that Badgerys Creek airport will be available for use before the end of the decade. As an ERC minister, I was well placed to press for that outcome. In doing so, we kept open the outcome that Badgerys Creek can be used to provide real and substantial relief from the noise of Kingsford Smith airport. There has been some criticism that this is not explicit in this legislation. This criticism is misplaced. The leasing documents will require the new lessee to develop Badgerys Creek airport to the standard required by the government. That is appropriate. It is absurd to suggest that a precise building plan should be enshrined in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that we have decided that the second airport will be available, we must ensure that the airport is used. This requires an ongoing, comprehensive program of development of Badgerys Creek airport and a program of transfer of certain aircraft operations to that airport. The government has started out on this path with its proposals to tighten the curfew. I welcome these decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the negotiations to occur over leasing the airport next year, following the completion of the due diligence process I understand to be under way at present, the government needs to make clear what its long-term plans for the airport are. I believe these plans should involve a transfer of aircraft operations to Badgerys Creek, starting with further extensions of the curfew at Kingsford Smith airport, direction of all freight only aircraft to Badgerys Creek, direction of all charter operations to Badgerys Creek and, over time, direction of an increasing proportion of international traffic to Badgerys Creek. Most international traffic, of course, is less sensitive to the greater distance to the central business district than is most domestic traffic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In passing, I note the absolute hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) on this issue. He tried to mislead the people of his electorate and others in the inner city that he would send all international traffic to Badgerys Creek. Under pressure, his aviation spokesman, Senator Parer, revealed that he would do no such thing, resulting in a complete backdown on the issue. He has been rightly condemned by the people of the inner city for this ham-fisted attempt to mislead them. His deception does not stop there as I will elucidate in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My proposed program of transferring demand to Badgerys Creek would of course induce further domestic demand in order to service this traffic as well as to take advantage of the natural attractions of Badgerys Creek, which I will come to in a minute. Obviously, the facilities at Badgerys Creek would need to be sufficient to cope with the demands generated. In particular, a 4,000-metre runway will be required. These leasing bills and the associated price capping arrangements provide a ready method by which this development can be funded. I add that I believe the rail connection should be included in this arrangement, possibly as a loan to the New South Wales government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the paper by the Prices Surveillance Authority on the broad principles that would apply in administering the price capping arrangements. There are some positive features in this paper, particularly the clear recognition that, as intended by the government, the new lessee can recover the costs of developing Badgerys Creek airport from charges at Kingsford Smith airport. However, I do have a couple of concerns with the PSA approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PSA's prime objective is to minimise the costs to consumers, consistent with efficient economic outcomes. That is a laudable and appropriate objective for that organisation. However, in the case of airports it is clear to me that the full value of airport land is not reflected in the FAC's books. At Kingsford Smith, for example, the FAC valued its pre-third runway land at around $75 million. For some 700 hectares of prime inner city industrial land, this is absurd. The effect of this undervaluation is that an implicit taxpayer subsidy to the aviation industry remains through the fact that the taxpayer is not receiving a full rate of return on the asset employed. In my view, the PSA should investigate this issue. If I am correct, the PSA should allow airport charges to adjust upwards accordingly, with any excess profit available for Badgerys Creek and the associated infrastructure, including the rail link. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue of concern about the PSA's approach is whether the PSA will recognise the complexities and subtleties the new lessee will face in relation to the complementary development of Badgerys Creek and Kingsford Smith airports. It  is important that the new lessee not act the way the Federal Airports Corporation has in strongly favouring Kingsford Smith airport over the second airport at Badgerys Creek for reasons that have much more to do with the institutional interests of the corporation than with the efficient provision of airport services. In particular, it is important that the natural attractions of Badgerys Creek, such as its lower land value and lower noise impact, be reflected in its pricing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that my proposed program of transfer should be achieved using the powers the minister retains under this legislation. In particular, demand management arrangements should be used to ensure that such a program is implemented. The minister's power over development approval should be used to effectively cap the operation of Kingsford Smith airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some misconceptions about the nature of capacity at Kingsford Smith airport. The 1991 environmental impact statement on the third runway was predicated on 303,000 annual aircraft movements at the airport. Any increase in the usage beyond this level would therefore represent a misleading of those affected on the true nature of that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EIS suggested that this level of activity would be achieved in the year 2010, but experience has shown, as I predicted at the time, that demand growth would be much more rapid than assumed and hence this level of demand would be achieved very much sooner than that. However, that same EIS quoted an ultimate capacity of 353,000 annual aircraft movements&mdash;a figure that is often mentioned in debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is often ignored in the debate is that this figure assumes a particular peaking pattern and a particular mode of operation of the airport. The fact is that capacity at the airport can be expanded above this level by a spreading of the peaks and measures to further increase hourly capacity. Possible measures to increase hourly capacity have been listed in a recent report of the tourism task force and Sydney City Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Residents of the inner city already badly affected by aircraft noise have a great deal to fear from these proposals. They are to reopen the stub of the east-west runway for commuter aircraft and to allow take-offs to the north on the new runway for jets such as 737s. It disturbs me very much that the opposition's transport spokesman alluded to precisely these proposals in his speech on the curfew bill recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely clear to me that the way the opposition leader would reconcile his commitment to reopen the east-west runway with the realities of airport operation is to adopt these proposals. In so doing, he would increase airport capacity by a further 10 per cent or so. This is the nature of the deception I believe him to be engaged in on this issue. The only alternative explanation for his statements is that he would be perfectly happy to accept a significant reduction in capacity at the airport, despite his longstanding support for the construction of the third runway. He will excuse my incredulity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Together, peak spreading and greater hourly capacity could lift the ultimate capacity of Kingsford Smith airport beyond even this higher figure. Obviously the noise impact of any additional traffic would be even more unacceptable than the present situation. I understand that the Sydney airport management of the FAC has developed a fantasy development plan entitled `Terminal 21' to meet a higher level of demand. That is totally unacceptable to me and, I understand, to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a positive side to my proposals. A persistent feature of this debate has been a failure to recognise the real attractions of Badgerys Creek to the aviation industry and its customers. The new airport will be of modern design with much lower operating times and hence operating costs than the poorly laid out, small, congested airport at Kingsford Smith. It will be congestion free. It will be curfew free. It will be able to handle the next generation of large jets. It is closer to a large and growing proportion of Sydney's industry and population. It will impose very much less noise on residents, and uses cheaper land than Kingsford Smith airport, both of which should be reflected in lower landing charges. It is in the region with the third highest unemployment rate in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the concerns of western suburbs colleagues that the problems of Kingsford Smith not be simply transferred to the west. I agree completely with that proposition. It is important therefore that the lessons of the Kingsford Smith experience be learnt and that proper analysis of potential noise and other environmental impacts and planning controls put in place to prevent residential development in affected areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the airlines are reluctant to use Badgerys Creek. I believe that this partly reflects the fact that congestion at Kingsford Smith airport represents a backdoor two-airline policy and hence that there is an element of vested interest in the two airlines in adopting that position. I also believe, however, that their reluctance reflects a concern that a program of transfer could disadvantage one airline relative to another in the marketplace. I accept that the proposed program must be careful to avoid this outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the initiative by the government represented by these bills. They create the possibility of decisions over the next two or three years to provide real and substantial relief for those affected by noise at Sydney airport. My concern from now on is to ensure that this possibility is achieved in actuality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the opposition's position on the issue relating to the east-west runway and the confused and contradictory statements emanating from the opposition about the future development of Badgerys Creek simply exemplifies the total policy bankruptcy of the opposition on this issue. The reality is that the coalition has over the years shown an absolutely hypocritical double standard on this issue. If you go back to the earlier days of this debate in 1989, the now opposition leader was not only supporting the development of the third runway but in repeated statements was endorsing the switch to configuration of the traffic on the north-south axis as a virtue. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we find in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today the heading `Coalition springs GST surprise'. It might have been a surprise to the editors of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, but it comes as no surprise to us. But, evidently, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, is following what is now becoming a time-honoured tradition by Liberal Party frontbenchers&mdash;and premiers&mdash;to say one thing in a closed gathering when they think the press is not present and to say a totally different thing, of course, in public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a closed gathering, evidently what the parliamentary secretary to the shadow Treasurer said was that he thought there was a lot more support for a consumption tax now compared with at the time of the last federal election when a 15 per cent goods and services tax formed the centrepiece of the opposition's policy platform and that he `would be very surprised if Australia did not have a consumption tax by 2020'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, is of a piece with the private discussion of the Leader of the Opposition on 1 May this year when he lamented the absence of a goods and services tax; of a piece, too, with the Deputy Leader of the National Party who, about 12 months ago, lamented the fact that the coalition had not been able to get the goods and services tax through at the last election; and, likewise, of a piece with Amanda Vanstone, the opposition's shadow Attorney-General, who also managed to make a very similar comment about 12 months ago. So repeatedly on to the record they come with a goods and services tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always followed up, of course, by denial. What electors have to bear in mind as we approach the election is the question of risk. Will this opposition, if it secures government, set the pattern in relationships and arrangements in the bureaucracy that starts the groundwork for an introduction of a goods and services tax? Or will it not, by any stretch of the imagination or in any shape or form, position itself in such a way where that might be possible?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do know about elections, of course, and we know too about governance over a three-year period&mdash;there is an election campaign and then three years after that&mdash;that, as governments confront problems from day to day, some of which may be anticipated and many of which will not be anticipated, there will always be opportunities for governments to say that circumstances have changed. There will always be opportunities for governments to do what is in their hearts as well as in their heads and not necessarily what they said.

In your remarks in support of Richard Court's legislation, you are not joined by employers. Employer organisations have had a bit to say about all of this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go through what they have said. The Chamber of Mines and Energy of Western Australia, which is probably the most significant of the employer groups in Western Australia, has described this legislation, which you support, as too extreme. The Western Australia Small Business and Enterprise Association, which is not an organisation that we would normally anticipate not being critical of unions or the unions' right to organise their enterprises, has described this legislation as excessive, overzealous and provocative. That is the description of the two employer organisations&mdash;too extreme, excessive, overzealous and provocative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These pieces of legislation by the opposition&mdash;in government in Western Australia&mdash;basically take away fundamental democratic rights&mdash;not just industrial rights but democratic rights. Before it was gutted, the state inspectorate of industrial relations in Western Australia used to deal with something like $6 million a year worth of employees' underpaid award wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it was gutted&mdash;the inspectorate was effectively removed and now can virtually do nothing&mdash;workers in Western Australia became totally reliant for the enforcement of those awards&mdash;for the enforcement, in fact, of contracts&mdash;on the ability of union representatives to come onto site and ensure that there was compliance with agreements, with awards and, indeed, with contracts. They had an unfettered right to do that&mdash;a right upheld by the Industrial Relations Commission from time immemorial. This legislation removes that right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a union to enter a site, it has to identify to the employer the employee who has asked it on. Everybody knows enough about the realities of industrial relations to know that that does not occur&mdash;that people seek outside support for them for their security&mdash;but to get on site now that is what the union would be required to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much discussion is had about the secret ballot provisions associated with that. Apart from their extraordinary unworkability, they apply to everything&mdash;any form of industrial action, not simply strikes. With this legislation, if you are a unionist and you say to your employer, for example, `As far as I am concerned, the way in which you have behaved is such that I intend to leave this job ahead of the conclusion of my contract', you are liable, potentially at least, to fines of about $1,000 a day. Those are just a couple of the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That builds on a set of propositions that come with the first tranche&mdash;which you also endorsed&mdash;which rip away minimum conditions in Western Australia and put in place there a minimum wage of derisory amounts, set not by an industrial relations commission, not by an economic test, but by Minister Kierath. If that wasn't enough&mdash;you asked me questions about the impact on wage earners and other of my constituents of any day's worth of industrial activity&mdash;contemplate the impact on their capacity to earn and their capacity to have security, and their capacity not to be interfered with when they arrive at decent agreements.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. The government is concerned to work with the taxpaying community to lower compliance costs. Recent initiatives that we have taken include completely rewriting the tax act and having the Taxation Office work with small businesses to lower costs for both state and federal taxes. We have also instituted the tax commissioner's liaison committee and also the financial products consultation. The recent passing of legislation in this parliament will reduce the compliance costs on the fringe benefits tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, a tax that has enormous costs for small and medium businesses. I refer to the GST, which is now squarely back on the coalition's agenda. In simple terms, this tax would devastate small business and a number of studies have been carried out which would support this. The first one I point to is a study carried out in New Zealand in late 1991 and early 1992. The New Zealand Institute of Policy Studies, which is non-political, carried out a major investigation into the compliance costs of business taxes in New Zealand. It was funded by the New Zealand tax office and had the support of the New Zealand Society of Accountants. The report found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . very clearly the disproportionate weight of compliance costs of GST on small firms . . . on average, for every $1000 of goods and services sold, the compliance costs of the firms in the smallest category is $26.61; the corresponding figure for businesses in the largest category is 5.4 cents. The smallest firms have compliance costs which, proportionately, are almost 500 times&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is not 500 per cent&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the largest.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is not bad enough, we should consider the impact that these costs would have on small businesses when they are competing with their larger competitors. A study of the British VAT in 1986-87 by Professor Cedric Sandford concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where small firms are competing in the same market with large firms . . . they are being put under a state-created comparative disadvantage. They cannot pass on their compliance costs to the same extent as the largest firms . . . compliance costs then become a factor helping to push small firms out of particular markets.</PARA>
<PARA>Even the Leader of the Opposition admitted the high costs when he was Treasurer. On 12 March 1981, when he introduced a ministerial statement on the taxation system, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A multi-stage VAT was rejected fairly quickly because it would have imposed an enormous paper work burden on both taxpayers and collecting authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>That was his position back in 1991. What is it this year? On 2 May 1995 a headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>reads `Howard leaves the door open on GST'. In the concluding paragraph, when he was asked about the GST, he did not give it away. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`We were talking about the last election. I mean you can criticise the marketing. You can say with the benefit of hindsight there is nothing wrong with it, but it was very, very poorly marketed', he said.</PARA>
<PARA>He said nothing about disowning it. The door to the GST is completely left open, even though in 1981 he acknowledged what everybody else around here knows&mdash;that the compliance costs of this tax are considerable indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But perhaps the impact on small business is best summed up in the January 1993 issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Small Business and Investing </EMPHASIS>where New Zealand accountant John Morine gave Australia's small businesses a more explicit warning. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If and when a consumption tax or GST is introduced in Australia, your personal stress level will rise sharply. Sunday at the beach with the family will be a thing of the past, as you spend your "leisure" time grappling with GST returns and trying to unscramble your accounting records from taxation complications you do not understand. You should consider how you will cope when you lose one day per week to GST, whether your business will survive and what you are going to do about it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So here we have a situation where the GST is clearly back on the agenda. As usual, there has been nothing from the opposition's Treasury spokesman. He leaves it to his parliamentary secretary. But you cannot blame the parliamentary secretary because he is only agreeing with his own leader and he is saying publicly what they are all saying privately&mdash;that they still believe in a GST.</PARA>

They are predominantly used for imaging and not treatment. There is no harm to patients in any case, even if the hospitals had not taken any precautions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Six times. To put it another way: from 1977 to 1982 in real 1995 dollars the average annual amount spent on housing for each defence family was $1,900. Under the Labor government that annual amount has increased to $11,900 per family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let's have a look at wages and conditions. This government has acknowledged that Defence Force service is different from every other form of employment&mdash;we said it in the white paper&mdash;and that is why we set up the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal some years ago. As a result of the combination of the tribunal and the enterprise bargaining system instituted by this government, ADF pay rates in the early 1990s largely outstripped the growth rates in the general community. Between 1992 and 1994 defence pay rates rose by 9.2 per cent, compared with three to four per cent in the general work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994, of course, we also increased the service allowance by 16.7 per cent, effectively giving&mdash;and I ask members to take note of this&mdash;a total increase in military salary of 11.7 per cent. Further still, on 28 September this year the tribunal endorsed a further 5.6 per cent pay increase for our defence forces, payable over the next year. Add to that the field allowance increase by over 200 per cent and the seagoing allowance increase by over 135 per cent and it is hard to see where wages have been eroded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let's turn to child care&mdash;an issue which is more and more important to our Defence Force families as each day goes by. How far have the conditions in this area eroded? To put it another way: how much did the coalition spend on child care in their years in office? Not a cent. Under Labor, the Department of Defence has become a leader in the funding and establishment of employer sponsored child care. Four million dollars has been allocated since 1991. Twelve centres are currently operating; two more are in the planning. That is a total of over 530 places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you add to that over half a million dollars in support funding for occasional child-care centres and $278,000 in grants for play groups since 1989, you can see that child care was actually an invention for the defence forces that occurred under this government. Let me go on record here and now and say this: there is more to come. There is more to come in terms of child care, spouse employment and assistance for ADF members to buy their own homes, just to name some.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, there has been no erosion of conditions for defence force personnel. I say this to the House: long gone are the days when coalition spokespersons could put down bald statements on defence and expect them to be taken on face value. That is because successive Labor governments have delivered not only on strategic thinking and not only on equipment but also on personnel conditions for the defence forces.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact of the matter is that, under the policies that this government has put in place over the last decade, the industrial relations performance in Western Australia until very recently has been the same as for the rest of the country. We have had a substantial reduction in industrial unrest, to a factor of about 10 per cent of what it was at the point of time when we came into office, and Western Australia has been the beneficiary of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been happening in Western Australia over the last few years is that Western Australians have been bolting from the system that Graham Kierath and Richard Court have introduced in Western Australia into the federal jurisdiction. Part of the purpose of the industrial relations legislation, which Graham Kierath is attempting to put in place now is to prevent precisely that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incorporated in this set of propositions by Graham Kierath is a proposition that if a group of workers, a group of unionised workers, decide that they want to go to the federal jurisdiction, it is open to the Western Australian state government, effectively, to remove their coverage of that group of workers and institute another union to cover them. That is what this legislation does, among many other heinous things&mdash;irrespective of what they think, irrespective of what their views are. So that capacity that they have had in Western Australia to bolt from the Western Australian system, to get into the federal system, is a capacity which is being removed effectively from them. That is the first point I would make in answer to the honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of what has been going on in the public sector in relation to industrial matters in Western Australia this year: you have had rolling strikes and industrial dispute virtually all year from the teachers in the government schools system; you have had that virtually rolling through the nurses in the hospitals; you have had the police in exactly the same position.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the member for Oxley for his question and acknowledge his long interest in defence matters, particularly with Amberley being in his electorate. The Leader of the Opposition claims that the government has allowed the ANZUS alliance to drift and that we have downplayed the alliance with the United States in the 1994 defence white paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, let me quote from chapter 9 of the white paper on alliances. It should interest the Leader of the Opposition to know that, in this chapter, five of the eight pages are devoted to the alliance with the United States. It says quite simply:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's defence alliance with the United States continues to be a key element of our defence policy and will remain so over the period covered by this white paper.</PARA>
<PARA>In essence, what the opposition has done on Australia's defence relationship in respect of the United States is simply to plagiarise from our 1994 defence white paper our ideas and parts of our strategic analysis, and then overlay them with all its prejudices from the 1950s. Let me quote from page 99 of the government's 1994 defence white paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">US strategic engagement and military presence will continue to be important to the security of Asia and the Pacific over the next 15 years. We will facilitate, when we can, US activities and deployments in the region.</PARA>
<PARA>Now let me quote from the recent address of the Leader of the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will strongly encourage the continuation of the United States presence in the Asia Pacific and do more to promote closer ties.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to thank the honourable member for his endorsement of our policy and really say what a pity it is that intellectual property rights do not extend to defence policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to downgrading the relationship, it must have been of great interest to the Leader of the Opposition to read in the weekend papers what General Colin Powell, the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had to say on the Australian relationship. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We had to find reasons just to get together,"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I mean, the relationship has been so strong, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm . . . you name it . . . "</PARA>
<PARA>I don't cite General Powell in a partisan political way, but his comments certainly illustrate the point that the Leader of the Opposition is a long way from the mark. I ask those people who make their decisions at the ballot box about defence issues to compare this with his comment that this alliance is somehow drifting due to government neglect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some hard facts on some exercises because this, too, is embarrassing to the Leader of the Opposition. In 1994-95 there were 28 exercises with the Americans, of which 20 were conducted in Australia. There were over 2,100 US service personnel here in Australia and over 130 aircraft and 25 US navy ships visiting in one form or another. Next year it will increase even further to 33 exercises. Four thousand US personnel may be involved and 150 aircraft may be here. Of course, we should all remember the significant contribution and presence of the United States in the recently completed K95 exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does this stack up against the coalition's record? In 1982, the last year of a coalition government, there were only 21 exercises held with United States forces, and only 10 of them were in Australia&mdash;half the amount we had last year. We see all this when the Leader of the Opposition has forgotten to mention that his coalition partners, the Nationals, have said from time to time, and no doubt will again in the future, that we should use the joint facilities as bargaining chips over wheat exports. The defence relationship under this government with the United States has never been stronger. The facts speak for themselves.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Paterson for his question. It would not surprise you to know that the degree of progress and understanding varies considerably between the states. In New South Wales, the Carr government has moved fairly quickly to implement reforms. This is particularly in the case of access for potential competition for the state rail system. New South Wales is also the only state that has passed enabling legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, Western Australia seems confused about what the reforms it signed up to actually mean. I have a few instances here. The ink was not even dry on the agreements when the state minister with responsibility for the Water Authority announced a privatisation of maintenance work carried out by Water Authority workers. In human terms, this meant that 1,500 low paid mainly blue collar workers lost their jobs. Some of them had been there for 30 years. He said that this was necessary because of the signing of the competition policy agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was wrong. I have pointed out already to the House on a previous occasion that the natural competitor was sitting there all the time in the Water Authority. It might surprise the House to know that the Homeswest tender for water service supplies was put out for tender on instructions from the minister. The Water Authority actually won that tender. The minister did not believe that a public authority could beat private sector firms and he asked for the Water Authority to check its figures, which it did. It came in with the lowest bid but it was stopped from doing the work. So much for competition policy in the Water Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then some time later we had the fiasco down at the waterfront. That was when the state government allowed a house builder who has strong anti-union views to be a stevedore on the port. The aim was to save $400,000. It cost the state economy $19 million and we lost the state shipping service. If you had seen this on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Monty Python</EMPHASIS> you would not believe it, but this is what is happening in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that, once again, we were told that this was because of competition policy. I have the report from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 24 May. It said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Buckeridge's company, BAAC Pty Ltd, a contract was all about competition and was in line with the Federal Government's Hilmer report on microeconomic reform.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing of the sort. All it was was a union bashing exercise, but here we have the state minister saying that the Hilmer report made him do it. The state government in Western Australia is not all that bright, but you would expect a little more of somebody who sits in this place. But no, the Leader of the Opposition, who talks about micro-economic reform but does not understand it, put out a press release on 23 May entitled `Hilmer demands Keating back WA over waterfront dispute'. In the body of his press release, the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yesterday's wasteful and widespread industrial action strikes at the heart of Hilmer. Paul Keating must show national&mdash;not sectional&mdash;leadership by calling on the MUA to accept the tender fair and square.</PARA>
<PARA>It was not a fair and square tender. That has been established since. Let us go back to the first part of that. What the Leader of the Opposition is saying in his press release is that this dispute on the Western Australian waterfront was at the `heart of Hilmer'. I am using his own words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition talks about micro-economic reform but it does not understand it. The Hilmer report and the competition policy reforms which flowed from it were about competition, not about being stupid. The sole aim of the waterfront confrontation was to try to bust a union. That failed. It should not come as any surprise to people around Australia that today we have more industrial disputation in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go on. A report on the Court government's radical plans for reforming the rest of the public sector was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper a couple of weeks ago, under the headline `Public sector revamp plan sparks mass strike threat'. That sounds familiar in Western Australia nowadays. The first paragraph of that report said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A continuing program of radical public sector reform is proposed by the Western Australian Government and seems set to escalate industrial activity by public servants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The framework depends heavily on traditional public service activities being sold to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA>This has got nothing to do with competition policy. Speaking in support of the reforms was the head of the Western Australian government's public sector management office, Dr Paul Schapper. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Schapper told the meeting last Thursday that the public service reforms were essential in the aftermath of State and federal governments' acceptance of the Hilmer Report's recommendations on competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA>Wrong again! These changes in the Public Service or down on the waterfront are driven by ideology, not by competition policy. We have already seen that the established work force, if it is a public sector work force, is not allowed to compete in Western Australia, even if it is competitive and can win a tender fair and square.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a pattern evolving here&mdash;the Western Australian government is so proud of its reforms that it has to blame them on the federal government's national competition policy. This is what it is all about. Now we have the opposition today doing the same thing. The embarrassment felt by those on that side of the House with what is happening in Western Australia must be acute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What they are trying to say now is that, because we have a strike in Western Australia today, it is somehow the federal government's fault&mdash;in exactly the same way as the state ministers and the Leader of the Opposition, who knows nothing about micro-economic reform, are trying to say that the shemozzle&mdash;and that is all you can say about what is happening in Western Australia&mdash;about these so-called reforms has anything to do with competition policy.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2211" SPEAKER="Lawrence The Hon C.M." NAMEID="XS4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="HUMAN SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that most members know that this is mental health week. Apparently the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;to answer the member's question&mdash;in the latest of his vacuous wasteland speeches, last week claimed that the Commonwealth's response to concerns expressed by Brian Burdekin about the neglect of people with mental illness could best be described as half-hearted. That is pretty rich coming from the opposition. The claim is also utterly without foundation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Medicare agreements, mental health has been the responsibility of the states fair and square. We fund, of course, visits to psychiatrists through private health legislation and Medicare rebates, but the provision of public sector mental health is a responsibility of state governments. Nonetheless, we have worked with state governments since 1992 to reform this much neglected area through the national mental health strategy. At the time when Mr Burdekin's inquiry was proceeding&mdash;in fact, before the report came down&mdash;we allocated some $135 million directly to the states to assist them with necessary reform to their mental health services and to promote the interests of people with mental illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members will know that in 1993 Brian Burdekin handed down his landmark report, and in response we effectively doubled the Commonwealth's contribution to $269 million in line with Mr Burdekin's key recommendations. So there is nothing half-hearted about our commitment at all. In fact, Mr Burdekin at the time welcomed the Commonwealth response and suggested that the states and territories should follow our lead. I would like to quote him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This budget&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that was 1994-95&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">also constitutes a clear indication that the Federal Government is now clearly committed to a leadership role in protecting the rights of the mentally ill.</PARA>
<PARA>That is another blunder by the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;claiming Mr Burdekin's apparent disappointment or our failing to keep pace with Burdekin reforms when that is far from the truth. I wonder sometimes at the contribution of the member for Chisholm. Either he is ignored or the information he gives the Leader of the Opposition is just wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the opposition should do, if they claim to support Medicare, is have a good, hard look at the role the states are playing in the area of mental illness and the treatment of mental illness. If you want to see how the Liberals manage health&mdash;mental health problems in particular&mdash;look at Victoria. We saw some savage exposition of its health system generally on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> last night. Equally, we could also look at South Australia, Tasmania and my own state of Western Australia, because what we will see is radical funding cuts, ideologically driven privatisations and industrial tyranny, which is having its effect particularly on people with mental illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only yesterday I was forced, after considerable correspondence, to write again to the Victorian Liberal health minister, chastising her for taking funds out of the mental health services more quickly than the Commonwealth has been topping them up. She has actually been removing funds while we have been putting them in under the national mental health agreement&mdash;that, in mental health week. That is what is actually going on in the state-run mental health services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria funding for mental health services appears to have been cut by 5.8 per cent, yet they claim it is an area where they have been improving their operations. I have asked Mrs Tehan to show cause why the Commonwealth should continue to put funds in when her Liberal government siphons them off and puts them into their own pet projects which have no benefit at all to people with mental illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spotlight has also been on South Australia's mental health system this week, following recent tragic shootings by someone who appeared to have had a history of mental illness. Again, what we see in South Australia is the Liberal-National modus operandi in health generally, and that is a savings driven deinstitutionalisation without any community service. It is unmatched by proper planning of accommodation services, community support and emergency teams. If the Leader of the Opposition was at all clear about what was happening to mental health in Australia, he would be talking to those state governments and others and making sure that they put the money and the services back.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the first time in Australia's history, to my knowledge, that a government has actually set out to score a base political point by condoning and encouraging union action to punish, by a blockade, the proposed actions of a duly elected government&mdash;a government which, in policies announced before the election, stated its commitment to introducing legislation for secret ballots to protect workers in relation to industrial action, for the consent of union members before political donations could be made, and for the prevention of jurisdiction hopping.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was so clearly demonstrated on radio this morning, this is just an opportunity for him. As we all know, we are heading for a federal election and it truly is the case that this man will literally do anything or say anything for his own political advantage.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Amongst the remarks which struck me this morning, which say so much about his attitude, was this: `I would never turn such industrial strife to suit my political purposes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He followed up with these words, literally&mdash;I wrote them down&mdash;`Howard runs a conflict model of industrial relations; the ALP runs a consensus model.' In other words, he took the conflict in Western Australia, which he has been encouraging, then moved on immediately&mdash;virtually in the same breath, and without a blush&mdash;to make the political point which so demonstrates my thesis. He is the arsonist who lights the fire, then runs back and complains that he did not know about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking through the development of this dispute, it is incredible for the Prime Minister to say that he did not know anything about it. On 6 September Tony Cooke of the Trades and Labour Council went on 6PR radio in Perth and called for the blockade. He said that he had written to the ACTU&mdash;the assistant secretary, Jim Pallas&mdash;seeking ACTU support. On 11 September Tony Cooke announced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> that the ACTU had agreed to support the blockade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where was the Prime Minister? Where was he when it was on radio in Western Australia that these guys were going to be running a strike? Perhaps he was at Lindsay Fox's for the day and missed the news. When it was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, where was he?

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we've got to do is to inflict harm on the economy of the state.</PARA>
<PARA>Where was the Prime Minister that day? Was he down in Queen Street, Woollahra, with his mates in the antique shop, so distracted that he missed the news? I challenge the Minister for Industrial Relations, who is at the desk, to tell us when he stands up whether he retracts his statements of support because on 5 October he is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before we&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the federal government: I presume he includes the Prime Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">were apprised of what the union had in mind for a blockade at the national level, I had some reservations. But I can say I have none today.</PARA>
<PARA>You actually said that, Minister. Where was the Prime Minister that day? Was he down with his new petrol head mate, John Laws, looking at his collection? On 11 October he was in Western Australia and was quoted as having `backed next week's planned statewide strike and blockade of WA business'. The Prime Minister says he did not know anything about it until he got to WA. How come on 12 October, when the Prime Minister was in WA, Jim McGinty was pretty clear about the Prime Minister's attitude&mdash;don't forget: McGinty is the head of the Labor Party in Western Australia and is as thick as thieves with Keating&mdash;because he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Keating is entitled to his point of view but I disagree with it and . . . I don't agree that inflicting economic pain on WA is the way to go. . . </PARA>

This guy who would sell coal to Newcastle fronted up in here yesterday and said the blockade was announced before he even went there: he knew nothing about it. No-one in their right mind would believe what the Prime Minister has to say. The fact is that he has been up to his neck in this dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the Prime Minister who has been involved. The minister, as I have just read to you, has publicly supported it and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)&mdash;she is not running the Keating line of `we neither support nor condemn' or `we neither confirm nor deny'&mdash;has a prerecorded message in her office in Western Australia. If you want the minister for health you ring up her office and are told, `We are all on strike today because we are getting stuck into Richard Court's legislation, and that is the basis on which you as a constituent are denied the basic service of having your local MP available to you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question about this whatsoever. The smile on the minister's face confirms the fact that these people have conspired to run this as a campaign. It has nothing to do basically with Western Australia. Western Australia is just your instrument: it is a tool. You have used the people of Western Australia for your own benefit at the political level. I will come to the very headline that you have got in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose one thing which I find particularly galling in all of this is the extent of the hypocrisy and the lies that these people tell. The minister told a distortion on radio this morning which I have already outlined. The picture those opposite want people to believe is that, since the Liberals have been in power in coalition in Western Australia, there has been industrial mayhem&mdash;that it is chaos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why it was so revealing when the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) got up and said that the level of disputes in Western Australia is the same as the rest of the country. That was something of a boo-boo but, when you look at the figures, you find that the number of days lost per 1,000 employees in WA for the latest year we have got is actually 42. That has dropped since the Labor Party was in office. Go back to 1989: it was 187 days. If you look at the figures, you see that they are not just going backwards: the fact of the matter is that they are lower now than they were under Labor, they are lower now than the national average, and they are lower than for Queensland. That is very revealing, because Queensland has exactly the same state industrial laws as we have federally. When it comes to the so-called industrial mayhem, the fact of the matter is that WA is a land of peace and calm compared with other states in the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second message that the government is trying to give to people is that in WA, as a result of these reforms, shock, horror, you could have the same federally if the coalition gets in. What they do not tell you is that people in Western Australia have actually been getting higher wages. In the latest figures, if you take the 12 months to May 1995, and you take all states and territories, guess who had the highest increase for average weekly earnings? The highest increase was Western Australia at 6.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than people having their wages cut, which is the lie you want the rest of the country to believe&mdash;this whole dispute is not so much about Western Australia; it is about a message you want to send to marginal seats in the rest of the country&mdash;people have got bigger wage increases in that 12-month period than in any other state. The state that has got the lowest figure is Queensland, with minus 2.2. It is the one state that replicates&mdash;duplicates&mdash;your industrial relations model, Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third incredible hypocrisy is your claim that the first wave and the second wave are the same. That is basically your line: it is just a nasty, horrid coalition government getting stuck into the workers. That is your line. I want to quote something Tony Cooke said this morning. Tony Cooke is running this strike. He said in respect of the first set of reforms in Western Australia that this was Pol Pot arriving in Western Australia and that people would be dying in the streets, et cetera. There was an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> this morning by Nigel Wilson, a person who used to work for Carmen, so he is no supporter of ours. He said this about the first set of reforms in Western Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the first set of reforms&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was achieved in relative harmony and both sides of the industrial equation accepted that industrial relations had changed irrevocably. West Australian Trades and Labor Council secretary Tony Cooke acknowledged as much earlier this year when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The legislative agenda and the approach of the State Government has been effective. There is no point in having an ideological blinker on which says, `they must be wrong&mdash;they have always been wrong' because they are actually being effective."</PARA>
<PARA>The guy running the dispute today as your instrument, Minister, has said that the first set of reforms was effective. You have got the quote here. We will have the distortions by the bucket&mdash;the Laurie load&mdash;in a moment from you. The Leader of the Opposition said that the model which Tony Cooke has endorsed&mdash;and which I have just shown you, Minister, has given the highest wages in the Commonwealth&mdash;is a model that we want. It is hypocrisy. You attack us for wanting to cut wages. The fact is that it is our policy to increase people's wages. That cuts at your heart, Minister. That cuts you to the quick. The truth is that after 13 years of the Labor Party the average person has had a cut in real wages. It is the great irony of Australian politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian situation is happening under the government. All these people under federal awards are all out on strike today; actually, I am not sure how many are out because only 400 turned up to the rally. Leaving that aside, the incredible cheek of you people is that this is happening under you, yet you say that this is what had happened under us. You must be a contortionist to understand this. People are losing the value of their real wages today under you people, and you say that is what is going to happen under us. The contortions in logic are incredible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Human Services and Health is saying that we were attacking the unions.

The member for Canning (Mr Gear) is supporting this industrial action, but when his own employees in his own office complain about their situation and take industrial action, he attacks them for doing so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing guaranteed to get members of the opposition frothing and bubbling more than working people exercising their right to take industrial action. Nothing gets them more upset and nothing can be more relied upon to rile them and have them in the state they have been in all day today than this issue. It started with their leader on radio this morning. He was absolutely venomous about the prospect of Western Australian workers having the temerity to express their opposition to the most draconian anti-union legislation anywhere in this country since World War II. That is what we have&mdash;the most draconian anti-union legislation you can imagine. Working people are up in arms about it and the opposition is absolutely venomous. `How dare they?', they say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has been trying to tell anyone who will listen for the last few months that he has softened his line about industrial relations. It is the new look John Howard. It is not just the eyebrows that have been trimmed up; this is the new soft, friendly, cuddly, absolute joy to behold to all the workers John Howard. The moment that workers exercise their rights against a vicious conservative government, we see the same John Howard showing his true anti-worker colours. He just cannot help himself as soon as he sees people going about their business, expressing their democratic rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning the ABC journalist asking the questions on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM </EMPHASIS>program must have felt like a snake charmer because after each one the opposition leader rose more and more like an agitated cobra. None of that is surprising to us. Right through his political career he has pursued a line that has been characterised by unprecedented industrial confrontation. We only have to look at the results of his years in office. They are well shown on the bar chart that I have here. All these dark lines up the top show that on average almost 600 working days were lost per 1,000 employees between 1976 and 1982. The bottom of the graph shows the Labor years. The average number of working days lost during all of that time was down to 200. It dropped from almost 600 to almost 200&mdash;a reduction of one-third. It has still been trending down for the last three years, down to the present number of 70 days. The Leader of the Opposition left it as 790 and now it is down to 70. But, as the Prime Minister so often says, today the Leader of the Opposition would say to Australia, `Let's go back to the good old ways. Let's go back to confrontation. Forget about consensus. Let's go and hop into the workers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is the Leader of the Opposition is all about the conflict based model. He has always been about it, and that is in total contrast to the results achieved through 12 years of Labor government. Now he wants to see us go back there. He has his state colleagues, particularly those in Western Australia, starting the work for him and is encouraging them to go all the way. We saw him endorse the Jeff Kennett reforms. Remember Jeff Kennett&mdash;the Jeff Kennett who said, `No worker will be worse off. Trust me. Elect me. No worker will be worse off'? One hundred thousand people in the streets of Victoria and 300,000 escaping the federal awards&mdash;that is what we have seen down there in a program endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent step is the Leader of the Opposition giving his blessing to the reforms in the Western Australian legislation. He went to Western Australia two months and two days after the second wave was made public and said that it was his template, that it was his model. Of course, he has been backing away from that ever since, but the reality is that he endorsed it. He said that it is his model. It is that model&mdash;the one he endorsed&mdash;which is provoking the national blockade we are seeing across Australia today as far as the Western Australian state is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does it tell us about the prospects for Australian-wide industrial relations? There would be conflict in the workplace Australia-wide were the Leader of the Opposition ever to get himself into power. It tells us that, as far as he is concerned, Australia ain't seen nothing yet. What we are seeing in Western Australia we would see writ large the length and breadth of Australia. The opposition leader endorsed, as he did again this morning, a system that has ministerial discretion to determine minimum wages. Imagine that: forget the tribunals, forget the umpire&mdash;ministerial discretion to determine minimum wages. He has used it to determine a minimum wage of less than $16,500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a system with an absolutely impractical and rorted system of secret ballots. People will not be able to have a stop-work meeting for an occupational health and safety issue without a secret ballot and six weeks notice&mdash;and the ballot will be conducted not by their union, not by the members on the job, but by the Australian Electoral Commission or by the AIRC. What sort of democracy is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a system that completely proscribes a union's right of entry and a union's ability to ensure award enforcement. This is a system without any award underpinning whatsoever. There will be no no-disadvantage test in Western Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> a lot of these provisions were run past the Leader of the Opposition. It is fair to say that on that program he publicly endorsed them. But what is worse is that he told a deliberate untruth when he said that the things relating to what happened if a union went into the federal jurisdiction had been taken out. That is what he said, and that is a deliberate and complete untruth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian government has done no such thing. There has been no such modification to the second wave. There is still a provision in the legislation allowing for the deregistration of unions seeking federal coverage and still a power for the minister to award coverage, and this morning John Howard endorsed that. That is what you are all about. That is the conflict model that you think is so terrific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to turn to Graham Kierath to see the proof of this. He said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 17 August that Mr Howard supported his plans for the second wave and supported them wholeheartedly. That is what he is reported as saying. That is for all to see in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> published on Thursday, 17 August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later on he was quoted again, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> of 20 August, as denying that the federal coalition was pressuring him to drop his legislation. He had this to say: `I have had no warning at all. The only discussion I have had with John Howard is with John Howard, and he seemed very supportive of the principles.' We can thank the newspapers for reporting the situation so adequately. Graham Kierath, with his own words&mdash;words expressed in the last two months&mdash;condemns John Howard and the deliberate untruths that John Howard would put to the Australian people today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Howard is supportive of Graham Kierath's principles. Of course, that was an expression that was made immediately before they buckled under the employer pressure, and they dropped the outrageous proposal to deduct union officials' pay during a dispute&mdash;that is one thing that they have dropped&mdash;and the provisions outlawing donations to federally registered unions and peak councils because they were political donations. They are the only two things you have dropped&mdash;nothing else. All the rest of this draconian legislation is still there fair and square. Added up, it is the nastiest piece of legislation and the most anti-labour legislation that we have seen in our time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister pointed out yesterday the absurdity of the coalition's position. Richard Court and Graham Kierath have introduced completely contemptible, vindictive, anti-worker legislation, and they have provoked an industrial blockade by the targets and the victims of their own legislation. They are responsible for this, and no amount of obfuscation can cover that. No amount of trying to apportion the blame onto this government for legitimate industrial action can hide the facts that this is all the work of vindictive, anti-labour legislation brought in by Graham Kierath and a model that is endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reaction of the victims is entirely understandable, and everyone in Australia will understand it. But, according to the opposition, the whole blockade is the Prime Minister's fault, this government's fault. What absolute nonsense. For them, it is all a conspiracy, it is all orchestrated from Canberra&mdash;all orchestrated for the federal elections, mind you. You cannot treat the intelligence of the Australian electorate with such utter and complete contempt and expect to get away with it. Not only does that pour scorn on the genuine grievances of ordinary Australians being industrially assaulted by the Court government&mdash;the same Australian battlers, I might say, whom the opposition leader said on the Howard Sattler program this morning should be sued for damages&mdash;it ignores the real culpability in all this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From our government's point of view, we are opposed to the Court government's legislation and we know that all fair-minded Australians are. But we have no influence with that government. There is no way in the world we could persuade them to drop this legislation&mdash;the legislation that is jeopardising industrial peace in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition could. He could use his influence. He has already used his influence in Western Australia&mdash;successfully, I might say, in the setting up of the farcical Marks royal commission. He has plenty of influence when he wants to use it, but he has not sought to here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, the Leader of the Opposition has been urging the WA government to go about this business. He is saying that quietly, but really he has been giving them a big rap in their pursuit of it. He has said that it is his model. He has supported the principles even when people like Judith Sloan&mdash;Judith Sloan of all people&mdash;have been calling for the second wave to be abandoned. Having Judith Sloan dump on you is like a conservative IR minister being dumped on by their own mother, but that is what has happened with this Kierath legislation. Instead of standing up and saying that the WA government should back away, the Leader of the Opposition has given them backbone and given them succour. Of course, he is doing so because Graham Kierath is doing his work&mdash;he is implementing his model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does that sit with the assurances given to ACOSS and the battlers? Of course, it does not. The Leader of the Opposition says to any audience who will listen to him that he does not want to threaten them in any way, shape or form. But the reality is that the plans have not changed; the plans are just hidden until after the next election. In the IR plan it is Jobsback, it is wage slashing, it is abolishing awards and it is encouraging industrial confrontation&mdash;pure and simple. In Western Australia we see his bona fides out in the open. He is for the second wave and he is for all the industrial conflict that is promoted. No amount of obfuscation and no amount of apportioning blame to us can hide those who are responsible for this blockade&mdash;that is, Richard Court egged on by John Howard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without that legislation there would be none of this conflict; yet it is the same Richard Court who had the temerity to say before the election that he was no Jeff Kennett. Perhaps not. I reckon he is probably worse. Now the opposition leader is trying to say that he is no Jeff Kennett and he is no Richard Court, but of course his actions say another thing. All his statements over two decades say just one thing: he is anti-worker. The opposition leader can say that he is no Jeff Kennett or no Richard Court, but he cannot say that he is no John Howard, because he is John Howard&mdash;the John Howard who supported the second wave, who supports industrial conflict and who supports Graham Kierath. By doing so, it is the opposition, not our government, which has a lot to answer for as far as this blockade is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, if the opposition got into power, you can be sure that blockades would not be restricted to Western Australia; they would be national.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia has a declining share of world trade, it has a foreign debt of $180 billion and it has nearly 800,000 Australians still out of work, 30 per cent of whom are the youth and the cream of this country. Today's union blockade is an absolute disgrace and the support of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his senior ministers is a disgraceful performance that will go down as one of the black days in Australia's history. All Western Australians, in fact all Australians, ought to be deeply concerned about what has taken place today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues driving this blockade deserve very close scrutiny by workers because their interests are not being served by the union elite who purport to protect their interests. The Prime Minister's interference is not warranted and not wanted in Western Australia. He would do much better and serve his party's interest if he stayed out of this. That is clearly the case when you consider that the Western Australian Liberal-National party coalition put out a clear policy direction as they went to the last election. It was available for everyone to see and the Western Australian public gave them a mandate to implement that legislation on industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union elite, serving their own interests and those of a self-serving Prime Minister and senior ministers, are intent on winning the next federal election, regardless of the cost and the pain inflicted on this nation's citizens. Their highest priority today is to maximise the disruption. There is a legitimate role for employee representation in this country. But, with an alarming decline in union membership, despite being protected by legislation in some areas, union officials need reminding of their obligations to union members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They received this reminder today. I received news that 400 people&mdash;400 people&mdash;were reported by the ABC as having attended this morning's rally for a major blockade of the whole state. The state has 1 1/2 million people. That was the ABC's estimate. The police estimated there were 200 people at this morning's rally. This afternoon at 2 o'clock there was a second rally, and they could not even muster 100 people. Those 100 people were probably made up of Carmen Lawrence's staff, along with the staff members of other Labor Party offices in Western Australia. So the workers in Western Australia have voted clearly with their feet and stayed away in droves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attendance of the titular head of the ACTU and its and the Labor Party's media personality, Jennie George, was not even a lure to get the public along to the two Perth rallies.

Jennie has been put there at the head, and we were all hopeful that we might see a change in industrial relations legislation and direction in this country. But, no, Kelty is still there and he is driving the bus. She was hurried over there and they were not able to get any kind of attendance up at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian public is not as gullible as the Prime Minister and some of the union elite would like to think. There have been statements on record from union officials signalling their intent to undermine the coalition as part of a blatant political exercise as we move towards the next election. Tony Cooke, the secretary of the WA union, said, `What we've got to do is to inflict harm on the economy of the state.' That was a clear agenda of the secretary. In a very fiery speech on the final day of the ACTU Congress in Melbourne, Mr Kelty, who is still driving the bus, declared that the unions were `drawing a line in the sand' in the battle against the coalition in the lead-up to the next federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workers understand that this blockade today has nothing to do with the rights of workers; it has everything to do with the panic-stricken Prime Minister and his ministers putting their privileged positions ahead of the interests of Australian people. This is best summarised by comments in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by economics editor Alan Wood in relation to the reasons why the bill is upsetting the unions. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But what an inspection of their list of objections does show is they have a lot to do with union power and privilege and precious little to do with workers' pay and conditions. This is what the blockade is really all about, and so is much of Labor's industrial relations policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not about looking after the pay and the conditions of workers; it is about protecting the union elite. These are the people who have taken over. The extent to which the Prime Minister is seeking to deflect attention away from any analysis of his disastrous handling of the Australian economy is encapsulated in his support for today's blockade. On 11 October it was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> that he `backed next week's planned statewide strike and blockade of WA business'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Prime Minister could not wait to have his say and attempt to whip people into a frenzy in WA with his tacit, if not blatant, support for this action, he is now denying any involvement. But I can tell you that the WA Labor Party leader, Jim McGinty, had no difficulty in fully understanding what the Prime Minister was saying. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Keating is entitled to his point of view, but I disagree with it and . . . I don't agree that inflicting economic pain on WA is the way to go.</PARA>
<PARA>There was no equivocating by the Prime Minister's senior ministers. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), who was just standing here a minute ago and has now deserted the House, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before we were apprised of what the union had in mind for a blockade at the national level, I had some reservations. But I can say I have none today.</PARA>
<PARA>He supports it totally: it is all right to hold the state to ransom. The Deputy Prime Minister and Western Australian member for Swan, Mr Beazley, was quoted as saying that he was `backing WA unionists' and `that the blockade had national support'. So he, too&mdash;Western Australia's own minister&mdash;was happy to go along with this. It appears that the Deputy Prime Minister, Kim Beazley, does not share the state Labor leader's view about inflicting economic pain on Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take a look at what WA's union blockade will do to WA today. It will affect 75,000 small business people. Despite the government's rhetoric, these are just hardworking men and women who are prepared to take risks and prepared to employ other Australians. The blockade will result in a loss of export income of approximately $50 million to $60 million at a time when Australia can least afford it. It will result in 1.5 million Western Australians suffering hardship and inconvenience. It will also result in small retailers bearing the brunt of union leaders and the Prime Minister's selfish actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tony Cooke, the Western Australian Trades and Labour Council secretary, said, `What we've got to do is inflict harm on the economy of that state.' That is their agenda. It is not to look after the workers; it is not to give them better pay and conditions. This is a blatant political exercise to disrupt my state and inflict maximum economic harm on it. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia has also condemned the Prime Minister's support for the blockade against an elected government and has stated that the stance taken by Keating and Beazley was outrageous. I would support that statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has quite correctly sought to introduce accountability and transparency into many areas of this economy, but it has not had the spine to insist on the same rules of accountability and transparency in the union movement. That is what this bill is largely about. It is about giving people choices; it is about democracy; it is about transparency; and it is about accountability. What is so bad about it is the fact that the union elite do not want to be accountable. They do not want things to be transparent within the movement. It does not suit their purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, employee representatives do have a legitimate role in the future of Australia, but there is no room for divisive and confrontationist activities that impact on the viability and the profitability of business and those responsible for providing the livelihood to millions of Australian people. </PARA>

In other words, he would take away the safety nets, crush allowances, crush award conditions and reduce living standards. These are all the things which John Howard stands for. The fact that Kierath has clinched the handcuff back on is repeated in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> of 20 August, in which Mr Kierath is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only discussion I've had is with John Howard . . . and he seemed very supportive of the principles.</PARA>
<PARA>So what are these principles, policies and legislation to which John Howard is so attached. What is the first wave and the second wave all about? In general terms, they are about safety nets going, minimum standards going or being pushed down, penalty rates going, overtime allowances going and meal breaks going. This is the same old industrial relations and living standards legislation, philosophy and principle that we have seen from the Liberals all our lives. It is the same approach that we saw from Sir Charles Court in 1974 when there was a day of action in Western Australia in opposition to his emergency services legislation. It has been carried on, like father like son, and it has been carried on by John Howard. What you see with Richard Court and Graham Kierath today is what you saw over 20 years ago with Sir Charles Court, and it is what you will see with John Howard if we ever have the misfortune of him being elected as Prime Minister of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Howard model is quite simple. It is all about lower wages; it is about worse conditions; it is about a massive rise in industrial disputation; it is about the abolition of safety nets; and it is about pushing down or abolishing minimum standards. As a worker, you may have lots of doubts about the things that you might lose, but you can be absolutely sure of one thing: John Howard will reduce your living standards. At the same time, as if pushing down wages, allowances and conditions was not enough, the cat has been let out of the bag. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today is headed `Coalition springs GST surprise'. They might say they are not going to introduce it, but you know that in their heart of hearts they really want to. You might have doubts about whether they will or they will not, but you know that in their heart of hearts that is what they want to do. So they will whack you with that too!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the man responsible for the development of taxation policy, has let the cat out of the bag. On the one hand, we have Howard handcuffing himself to Graham Kierath and Court. On the other hand, we have the development of taxation policy going back to the old Fightback proposal, a GST. These are the things that we know they in their heart of hearts are absolutely committed to and would do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get an indication as to what some people in Western Australia have had to say about the industrial relations legislation of Mr Kierath and Mr Court. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 21 June, under the heading `Kierath plans flawed', says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Major aspects of the Court Government's proposed second wave of industrial relations are provocative and unworkable, according to the WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labour Relations Minister Graham Kierath's plans would bring the community pain in exchange for marginal benefits, chamber labour relations director Brendan McCarthy said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>A quote from Mr McCarthy reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why legislate knowing something is not going to work? Because it is unworkable and because it is impractical, it would be bad legislation and we are opposed to that.</PARA>
<PARA>An editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on the following day, on 22 June, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be a clear signal to him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Kierath&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to think again for the sake of industrial stability when both the WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Trades and Labour Council denounce his legislative proposals as unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Kierath has shown a hidebound resistance to calls for change to controversial parts of his so-called second wave of industrial legislation, despite the blunt rejection of them by the most effective parties.</PARA>
<PARA>The editorial goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The community will not support laws that are unfairly one-sided in their application&mdash;or appear to be based on vindictiveness rather than need&mdash;regardless of whether unions strike over them.</PARA>
<PARA>How prescient that comment from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 22 June was. Some six weeks before, John Howard stood up at the Liberal Party conference in late July and said, `What you're doing here, what you're proposing here, I wholeheartedly agree with and I would do nationally.' I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The community will not support laws that are unfairly one-sided in their application&mdash;or appear to be based on vindictiveness rather than need&mdash;regardless of whether unions strike over them.</PARA>
<PARA>How prescient was that editorial from the west. We find further examples from Western Australia in August in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> under the heading `Bosses question industry reforms'. This is the Chamber of Commerce questioning Kierath's reforms. But we find the quote of all quotes coming from Kierath himself on ABC TV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> on 23 August 1995. Talking about the system he has implemented and is proposing, he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's really empowered the people at the workplace to make arrangements on wages and conditions that suit them . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And we did that quite deliberately, we thought that there would be some areas of the labour market that were over-priced and needed to be re-adjusted, what we would call low-skilled, low paid starter jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is Kierath, bold as brass on ABC TV, stating a deliberate strategy to reduce the wages of low skilled, low paid jobs. That is what John Howard has handcuffed himself to. That is what he would do if he ever became Prime Minister. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The existing air traffic control facilities are operationally deficient. An audit of air traffic control services at RAAF base Darwin identified that the replacement of radar and communications equipment is crucial to safe air traffic operations at Darwin.

<PARA>I move this way because, notwithstanding the efforts of the shadow Attorney, Senator Vanstone, to have this matter by agreement deferred, the government has declined to follow that course. On 12 October, which is last week, the shadow Attorney wrote to the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) indicating that she was concerned about the timing for the second reading debate on the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill and noting that the bill was to be debated in the House of Representatives this week. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will be aware that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has been conducting an inquiry in relation to the bill. It is due to report to the Senate on 18 October. I understand from conversations between my office and yours that your intention is to seek the passage of the bill in its current form, with some limited amendments foreshadowed in committee hearings, but will consider any committee recommendations in the context of the bill's passage through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must say I have considerable concerns with this course, given the importance of the bill both in the federal context and its role as a model for state and territory legislation. It deserves, as does any piece of legislation, proper consideration by both houses.</PARA>
<PARA>She further went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Numerous and detailed concerns that have been raised in relation to the bill warrant proper consideration by both houses. By increasingly treating the lower house as nothing more than a rubber stamp for initial drafts of legislation, you acknowledge as impotent the House of which you are a member and fundamentally undermine the importance of our bicameral system. Given that the committee's inquiry has occurred prior to debate in the House of Representatives, I believe you should respond to any committee recommendations prior to the passage of the bill through either house. I believe the debate should be deferred. However, should you intend to proceed with the bill, I request your assurance that you will not debate it until at least the day following the tabling of the Senate committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA>I have a copy of the minister's reply and will read the relevant section. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my intention to proceed in the House of Representatives with the bill in its current form, including the foreshadowed amendments, but debate will be after the Senate committee reports.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can assure you I have no intention of treating the House as a rubber stamp in the passage of the legislation. As a minister in the House, I naturally reject any proposition that would make the process of the House subject to those of the Senate. If there are any recommendations in the Senate committee's report which are acceptable to the government, then this can be dealt with in the Senate. The bill will of course need to come back to the House of Representatives. I believe this is fully consistent with the importance of our bicameral system of government.</PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, the Senate committee will not be reporting until 26 October. Clearly, the date for discussion of this matter will be for the tabling of the report and will be after the debate has concluded in the committee, if we follow the course recommended here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee has not reported. It will not report until 26 October. The date has been extended for the tabling of that report&mdash;and 26 October is the date. If the matter is to be debated on Thursday, as the government proposes, it will be debated before the parliament has had the benefit of the knowledge of the Senate's concerns in relation to a number of matters. They are important matters. Let me just give some indication of some of those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the committee has had raised with it questions relating to the carrying out of forensic procedures before a person has been arrested. This gives the police powers, contrary to the Australian Law Reform Commission, the Gibbs committee and the Coldrey committee recommendations. While the government seeks to justify that provision, the fact is that it is contrary to the recommendation of each of those bodies. The bill authorises a constable to order non-intimate forensic procedures if a suspect does not consent&mdash;and, again, this extension of police powers is contrary to the Law Reform Commission, the Gibbs committee and the Coldrey committee recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There have been other suggestions made that the operation of the bill should be subjected to a regular system of audit. It has been argued that the bill should include offences for exercising or threatening to exercise powers contained in the bill without following proper procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also of concern that the bill allows for the taking of swabs, or photographs of breasts. It has been argued that it is difficult to imagine an offence for which forensic evidence obtained by such means would be necessary. It has been suggested that the bill is likely to disadvantage those in the outback areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are all matters that have been raised before the Senate committee and upon which it has been asked to deliberate and report, yet we are being asked to consider this legislation when we know that it will not be tabled in the Senate for another week. In those circumstances, the only proper course to follow is to carry this motion I have moved today; that is, to omit this bill from the reference to the Main Committee and, in relation to this matter, to generally determine that the second reading be postponed until the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has reported to the Senate on the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that is an unreasonable course. If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) has instructions to follow any other course in relation to this matter, that indicates that the Minister for Justice's assurance that he has no intention of treating the House as a rubber stamp or of making the processes of this House subject to those of the Senate was clearly a nonsense, that he did not mean what he said and that he has no regard for this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an occasion on which I am debating particularly this reference, but it is the case in relation to numbers of bills involving the Minister for Justice that opportunities for this House of parliament to be involved in considering the detailed provisions of legislation have been, under his stewardship, specifically avoided. He has always taken the view that any reference to our committee on legal and constitutional affairs ought not to be entertained when the Senate committees are deliberating on these matters. He seems to take the view that the Senate committee is appropriate and that there ought to be only one inquiry by one committee, but he now seems to take the view as well that this chamber should have no knowledge of and no ability to consider the detailed recommendations of Senate committees in relation to bills we are considering. It makes a nonsense of the legislative process and this course being followed certainly devalues this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the parliamentary secretary has been fulminating about this matter. I am quite astonished that there would be any sensitivity about it. In fact, I would have hoped that the parliamentary secretary would have been endeavouring to reach the minister, who is not here to see his reference of the bill to the Main Committee. She seems to take the view that we ought to accept this as a fait accompli. I think it degrades the parliament. It degrades this chamber. It makes it a chamber of second order significance in the consideration of important legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have moved this motion and we will divide on this matter. We consider it to be of great significance, a matter which reflects the way this government sees important legislation of this sort. It sees it as being legislation that ought to be considered without details, without comments and without the opportunity to hear what others have had to say in relation to the provisions and without the benefit of that expert advice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second and support the motion of the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). I will approach the issue before the chair in two ways. In the first instance, I will take a benevolent view of what has occurred. The letter from the shadow Attorney-General, which was effectively read by the honourable member for Berowra, raises the question not so much of the consideration of the bill before the tabling of the Senate committee report as of whether this House should be debating the bill without knowing what amendments the government will seek in response to the Senate committee report itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time that letter was written, it was anticipated that the Senate committee would report tomorrow, 18 October. It was only known at that point that it was to be debated next week. In his reply, the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) said that it is his intention to proceed without any amendments that might arise out of the committee report, other than those foreshadowed during the committee hearing by government representatives. He did say that debate would be after the Senate committee report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect, what has happened up to this afternoon is consistent with the minister's undertaking. But this afternoon in the Senate the time for tabling of the report was extended by a week and a day&mdash;from Wednesday of this week to Thursday of next week. That means that if the minister is genuine in his intention that the debate be after the Senate committee reports, the debate in this House will not take place before 27 October. That is consistent with his expressed intention in the letter. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my intention to proceed in the House of Representatives with the bill in its current form, including the foreshadowed amendments, but debate will be after the Senate committee reports.</PARA>
<PARA>On that basis, there is absolutely no reason for the minister to not, consistent with his undertaking expressed in writing, now extend the time for debate of the bill in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one takes a less benevolent view&mdash;there are some reasons one might take such a view&mdash;the actions of the minister in refusing to allow the bill to be debated until after the Senate committee reports are in effect making this House a mere rubber stamp. It is not enabling this House to debate the government proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history is that this bill is a highly contentious bill. It has been prepared as a model for state and territory governments to adopt. As a model, it will introduce dramatic new powers for police and authorities exercising police powers which are of an intensely personal and intimate nature. Those powers may be exercised not only against people who have been convicted, not only against people who have been charged, not only against people who are believed to have committed offences but also against persons who are merely suspected of having committed an offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are very draconian powers. They may be appropriate if correctly examined, but we do not know what the Senate committee will determine in its examination. It has conducted an examination which the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee offered to undertake. The minister declined to allow that to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benevolent view&mdash;that the minister was really concerned to allow debate in this House to take place after the Senate committee report has seen the light of day&mdash;is open to some suspicion. The suggestion really ought to be that the minister wants to have this bill rushed through this House and dealt with in the Senate at a time which would enable the Senate amendments to be dealt with without any consideration in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is taking the debate in this House for granted. The fact that it has been referred to the main committee which was set up originally largely to deal with non-contentious bills also raises a query because it must have been known to the minister right from when this bill saw the light of day as an exposure draft that it would be contentious when it came to be debated. It must have been known to him at all times that it would be the subject of intense scrutiny and would be likely to be the subject of extensive debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the minister is in breach of his undertaking if he does not allow the debate in this House to be postponed until the Senate committee report is available. In failing to postpone the debate, the minister is really revealing that his intention never was to allow the Senate committee report to be properly considered in this House. Without that report, the debate will have to proceed on the strength of what is known as a result of the public inquiry, but it will not have the  benefit of a careful consideration by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee of the important provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is treating the House as a rubber stamp&mdash;something he denies in his letter. Although he asserts that he naturally rejects any proposition that would make the processes of the House subject to those of the Senate, by his very actions he is making that happen. He has already made the actions of the House committee subject to the actions of the Senate committee&mdash;something for which, as the member for Berowra has said, the minister should stand condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is not party political. It has not raised any issue that is going to determine who is going to win the next election. None of those likely to contribute to the debate, previously, were likely to raise any issue relevant to the politics between the major parties in this House. But an issue is now raised that demonstrates the arrogance and contempt with which the government treats the House. It treats it as a mere numbers exercise to bring legislation into this House. It does not wish to see any legislation properly considered in this House. The government does not wish to see any legislation brought before a committee of this House for proper consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is treating the House as a rubber stamp. I believe this House will rue the day when it ceases to exercise the proper function of considering and debating legislation. I support the amendment which would see this bill not referred to the main committee until the Senate committee has reported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We oppose the amendments that have just been moved by the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). We oppose them for a number of reasons. From a procedural point of view, it should go down in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> exactly what has been moved and the hypocrisy of the particular motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the preparation for referring bills to the main committee, they are indicated for quite some time; in fact, it was a procedure that was put into operation when the main committee was established and agreed to by both sides of the House. A procedure motion like the one I moved just now on behalf of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is agreed to by whips on both sides&mdash;the government whip and the opposition chief whip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When that is moved and agreed to we then have the daily program and the daily program is then printed following consultation&mdash;consultation, again, as I said, through the whips. We then have the procedure that we experienced here today where the bills on behalf of the Leader of the House were moved, which I did because I was here in this House on duty and I was only too happy to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Berowra thought he was going to hoodwink or lasso us, I assume, for what purposes I really do not understand. The member for Tangney (Mr Williams) tried to repeat what the member for Berowra had gone on about. I decided to go straight out and have it checked. Maybe the Leader of the House may have been mistaken or perhaps our government whip may have been mistaken or perhaps the opposition whip was not consulted. If that were the case, then I thought the member for Berowra and the member for Tangney had a right in what they were doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As of 5.18 p.m., we went and had it checked again. Surprise, surprise! We find that the honourable member for Tangney and the honourable member for Berowra seem to be standing alone. Even their side of the House is saying that we had an agreement. We agreed, as indicated by the motion before the House today, that these bills would go to the main committee for debate. </PARA>

I noticed he did not read out in full the letter from the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). I accept that. After all, if you want to make a point in a debate it is far easier to criticise when you do not provide the full evidence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the member for Berowra was stating the reasons as to why he wanted this bill deferred and not sent to the main committee, he virtually stated that he wanted this House to operate on condition of the Senate's instruction. If the day comes when bills are introduced into the House of Representatives and we then have to sit back and wait for instructions from the Senate as to whether we should or should not debate a bill, I would have to question what his motives are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again question the motives of the member for Tangney. Do the member for Berowra and the member for Tangney have a certain agenda that the opposition has not got; and if they have do opposition members not all agree to it; or do they have a certain agenda they wish to carry without really coming forward with the true reasons?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the consultation that has taken place, I can only assume that not only are we, the government, always being confounded at no policy coming from the opposition but also what we seem to have here today is conflict in the opposition&mdash;conflict about procedures of debate in the House.

Most importantly, the government will not be shanghaied by this type of underhand trick. Both previous speakers in this House understand and appreciate that the second house was established because we wanted debate on bills and debate on procedures to take place. Both members, in speaking on this motion today as to the reasons why they wanted to have this particular bill omitted from the program, fully understand the procedures that go on in the main committee. They also fully understand that you can still have a wild debate.

I suggest in future when they want to shanghai a motion that has already been discussed and put into procedure as part of the daily practice and program in this House they better go back and get their marching orders a little more specific, because what they have done is not the normal procedure. It has certainly created a precedent for any future actions. No matter what is going to happen, we will know in future we cannot always rely on agreements reached on procedure motions such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government certainly opposes the motion. It opposes the way it has been introduced.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs Tariff Proposal No. 8 (1995).</PARA>
<PARA>The tariff proposals which I have just tabled contain alterations to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Excise tariff proposal No. 4 (1995) and customs tariff proposal No. 8 (1995) formally place before the parliament, as required by law, tariff alterations made by notice published in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Special Commonwealth Gazette</EMPHASIS> s386 of 10 October 1995 during the recent recess of parliament. The changes are operative from 11 October 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Excise tariff proposal No. 4 is consequent on measures in excise tariff proposal No. 3, which I introduced into the House on 29 June 1995. As foreshadowed by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in the budget on 9 May 1995, excise proposal No. 3 amended the definition of fuel oil in order to exclude so-called light fuel oils from that definition. Fuel oils not meeting the definition are now dutiable at the rate of excise applying to diesel fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Topped crude petroleum oils for use otherwise than as refinery feedstock can be used as substitutes for fuel oils, but some topped crudes can also be used, and are being used, as substitutes for diesel. Excise tariff proposal No. 4 provides that the fuel oil rate of excise duty only applies to non-refinery topped crudes, meeting the requirements of the definition of fuel oil detailed in subsection 3(4) of the Excise Tariff Act 1921. Other non-refinery feedstock topped crudes will now be dutiable at the diesel fuel rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs tariff proposal No. 8 introduces similar alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Excise tariff proposal No. 4 also provides exempt status for all condensate which is produced separately or marketed separately from stabilised crude petroleum oil, other than condensate intended for use as a fuel. Condensate which is produced and marketed as part of a crude oil stream will continue to be regarded as crude oil and remain subject to the crude oil excise arrangements. This amendment removes an unintended consequence of the present legislation which could, in certain circumstances, require the payment of excise duty on condensate production that is intended to be excise exempt. A summary of the alterations contained in these proposals has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Airports Bill and the Airports (Transitional) Bill revolve around the government's program of privatisation and assets sales. They are fundamental bills to that program, a program that the government has not been too successful with in recent times in the number of Commonwealth assets&mdash;taxpayer owned assets&mdash;that have been factored into budgets over the last couple of years and the subsequent sales prices that have been achieved. Let us hope for the sake of the people of Australia that the government ultimately achieves the budgeted prices for the sale of the Federal Airports Corporation and the airports that it is going to sell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government proposes initially to sell a number of airports, namely, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. The coalition has proposed an amendment which includes Adelaide in that sale, and there is also a rider attached to the sale of Sydney airport which includes KSA and Sydney West. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been involved in a number of inquiries in this place over the last two years which have revolved around the commercialisation of government business enterprises with a particular focus on the now defunct Civil Aviation Authority and the soon to be defunct, as a result of these bills, Federal Airports Corporation. In our report we came up with the recommendation that the Civil Aviation Authority of Australia as a commercialised entity should be split, that air safety control should be brought back under the department and that the air traffic section should remain a commercial entity. Ultimately, the government, after much prompting from a number of different areas, including the opposition, took that course of action and established Airservices Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry we also had the opportunity to discuss at length with the Federal Airports Corporation the ultimate proposition of the government which is embodied in these bills&mdash;that is, the privatisation of the Federal Airports Corporation or the privatisation of the government owned or taxpayer owned airports in Australia. It was indicated at that stage that, of the 22 airports owned by the taxpayers of Australia, only six or seven were actually profitable. The alarm bells should be ringing a little bit here: it is obvious that the first tranche of this sale is going to encompass the profitable airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question should be asked: what is going to happen when we get to the stage when the first tranche has been sold and we are down to selling the rest of the airports, a lot of which are not profitable and are subsidised from the more profitable airports? The indication that was given by the Federal Airports Corporation at the time was that the whole outfit should be sold lock, stock and barrel so that it could remain providing the services as they stand today to the travelling public across Australia and at reasonably acceptable market prices because of that cross-subsidisation from one airport to another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that that element of the operation of the FAC has been attacked from a number of different areas. The Prices Surveillance Authority conducted an inquiry back in I think 1993 which recommended that the Federal Airports Corporation should not cross-subsidise the aeronautical side of its operations with the profits being made by its commercial activities in leasing out space in terminals to commercial operators. This created a fair amount of concern in regional Australia. It meant that the cost to the travelling public who fly from regional Australia into some of the major airports would have increased to such an extent that it may have made those regional airlines unviable. That has been highlighted in a government discussion paper entitled `Pricing arrangements in the pre-lease period' where those options are certainly discussed&mdash;not just cross-subsidisation within airports like KSA but also cross-subsidisation from the more profitable airports to the non-profitable airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the whole privatisation debate in the public policy area, we should be drawing as much as we possibly can from the experiences of the United Kingdom where the current government and the previous government, the Thatcher government, went hell for leather privatising a number of government owned monopolies without any due concern or diligence being shown towards the establishment of suitable regulation over those authorities. That is what we believe is missing from these bills. In the haste&mdash;and I emphasise `haste'&mdash;of the assets sales program, we do not believe there has been enough regard to regulation. It is too late after it has been sold. It is too late when the citizens of Australia are not receiving the services that they are used to at a reasonable price. It is too late when the government has sold off a profitable monopoly to the private sector without reasonable regulations in place over and above those assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with a great deal of caution that the coalition is participating in this debate. The government should realise that they will only get one lick of the lolly out of this. If you own an asset that is producing a profit year in and year out, you can budget for that each year. But you can only sell it once. Once the money you have received from the sale has been spent, there is no more income. There is no year-in, year-out income as there is at the moment. The government would be well advised to move very cautiously with this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the purpose of these two bills is to get into a position with the Federal Airports Corporation for the sale of the airports we have mentioned. The coalition is proposing to move amendments that seek to include the Adelaide airport in the first tranche of the sale process, along with Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports. The coalition is also proposing to move an amendment to defer the privatisation of Kingsford Smith airport by excising it from the relevant parts of the legislation until satisfactory arrangements are in place to more equitably share the aircraft noise burden over Sydney, particularly through the resumption of full operation of the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are two elements to the amendment proposed by the opposition. It should not come as a surprise to the government. This is an issue that has been flagged over the last month with the very intense and emotional debate in Sydney over the burden of aircraft noise above a number of its suburbs. Blind Freddy can see that aircraft approaching KSA are now being funnelled down the north-south access, making a very distinct political point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very cynical exercise being undertaken by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). I do not know what it takes to get a message across to someone but the Minister for Transport still has not got it. He has to drive around Sydney in a car with darkened windows so people cannot see him and have bodyguards with him, such is the emotion and anger of so many residents in many suburbs&mdash;not just the suburbs north of the harbour that the government likes to allude to when we participate in these debates, but also many inner city suburbs, suburbs represented by members of the government. The Minister for Transport is not taking any notice of the concerns being expressed by those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was proposed by the private member's bill recently, the aircraft noise issue must be resolved before the Commonwealth signs on the sale of these airports&mdash;before these two bills pass through this House and the Senate to become law. That issue must be addressed now because it cannot be addressed afterwards. Once the government sells these assets, if there is no proper regulation in place beforehand, they forfeit the right to do anything about the very serious problem in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this government's responsibility. They closed down the east-west runway. This government made the decision to spend somewhere in the vicinity of $250 million on what is now the second runway but is loosely called the third runway&mdash;the parallel runway in Sydney&mdash;then closed down the east-west runway. We still have not seen the new control tower operating. We still have not seen the new radar system in operation. The net result of all that, after how many years, is fewer aircraft movements per hour. The major international airport in this nation&mdash;the gateway into this country&mdash;is less efficient than it was before any of that action was taken by the government. It is just outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have government members coming in, defending the position taken by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport. We have poured hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars into this exercise. But every time we travel in and out of KSA, there it is unmanned. I heard that, on Australia Day this year, the Minister for Transport told Bill Swingler, a then executive officer of the FAC, and Buck Brooksbank, the acting CEO of the CAA, that they were not to do anything about opening that control tower until he, the minister, told them to act. That is the situation we are in with this government and they should stand condemned for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are flagging to the people of Australia that there is an alternative course of action to the one the government has taken with respect to our No. 1 international airport&mdash;the No. 1 entry point into this nation for overseas travellers. There are also the disturbances to domestic travellers and disturbances to the people who live in the suburbs under the flight paths around KSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, the opposition proposes to move amendments to these bills. We should flag at this point that the coalition is not opposed to the privatisation of the FAC and these airports as long as that is done in a proper and orderly manner and the government has regulations in place before they head down that path. I note from the explanation that goes along with these bills that there is a section that talks about regulation under the Airports Bill. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Airports Bill 1995 </EMPHASIS>sets up a system for regulating airports currently owned and operated by the FAC on behalf of the Commonwealth and Sydney West Airport following their leasing. These regulations include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">operations covering pricing and service levels&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is very important but do they go far enough? We do not believe so. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">limits on ownership and controls&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is fine. That was flagged by the shadow minister, the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), in her address earlier today. We can put a 49 per cent foreign ownership cap on this but are the mechanisms there to ensure that does not zoom past 49 per cent with the initial float, requiring later redress, as we saw with the Qantas float?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It goes on to talk about `slot allocation'. Those are dirty words to commuters, particularly with regional airlines, travelling in and out of Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney. If you are going to Sydney to do business, you buy your ticket and budget your day, thinking you will arrive at such and such a time, giving you enough time to transfer onto another flight. But that never happens because of slot allocation, particularly with regional airlines. My greatest concern in this whole exercise is that the regional airlines that service not only New South Wales but other parts of Australia will be squeezed out of the equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the proposition came forward from the Prices Surveillance Authority that the FAC should not be cross-subsidising its aeronautical operations through its commercial activities, the FAC said, `We will have to increase our leading charges in shoulder periods per landing.' That was going to add somewhere in the vicinity of $1 million in costs for outfits like Hazelton airlines, which services a lot of regional ports in New South Wales. It would almost put them out of business because it comes out of the profit they make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The travelling public cannot afford to bear that sort of burden. That is the sort of effect that I am afraid of with this whole process if the government is not very diligent with respect to the regulations they need to put in on the operation of these airports before they embark on the leasing exercise. Once done, they are gone, and the government needs to have the regulation in place first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, I might be labouring long and hard the point about the impact on regional travellers and regional airlines, particularly in New South Wales, but that is the part of New South Wales that I represent, just as you do. You should also be concerned about what may happen to the regional airlines that operate out of ports in my electorate as well as in yours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier I mentioned a government discussion paper that was released on pricing arrangements in the pre-lease period. There are a couple of sections in the paper which I am concerned about. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The move towards more economically efficient pricing principles will lead to changes to the structure of prices at some airports. While it is not possible to be definitive about the level of likely price changes in the absence of detailed and disaggregated cost projections, there is likely to be price adjustments required at the smaller regional and general aviation airports, with resulting regional and local impacts. Changes may also result at some of the larger airports.</PARA>
<PARA>The paper went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Price changes would also be expected at the major airports over time as large infrastructure projects currently under construction are completed and incorporated into the airports' cost bases.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading `Options for implementing "efficient" prices', the paper stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the likely need for price changes and the resulting regional and industry impacts, a full move to `efficient' pricing levels in the pre-lease period at all airports is not proposed. Instead, it is expected that there will be a graduated move towards efficient pricing levels in the pre-lease period, with the aim of moving aeronautical cost recovery to a pre-determined level prior to leasing.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . while recognising that the likely price adjustments required impose additional costs on industry and regional communities which should be phased in over time. The approach is also consistent with ICAO guidelines and principles for the setting of aeronautical charges . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I say in response to that that everybody in this place knows full well that Australia is different from the majority of other nations. We are an enormous island continent with a small population in comparison with the size of the place. We have vast distances to travel. We talk about the tyranny of distance in Australia and we have to be prepared as a Commonwealth to implement strategies that can provide equitably priced services to the majority of people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that means a bit of cross-substitution between airports, if it means a bit of cross-substitution between activities at individual airports, then so be it. If we do not pursue policies like that in all sorts of public policy areas, we are all going to end up living on the eastern seaboard in Sydney, Newcastle, Wollongong and Brisbane because we will not be able to afford the services outside of those cities. That is something that I know a lot of government and opposition members are cognisant of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding my remarks on the bill, I urge the government to seriously consider the implication on regional people and on regional airlines and the costs. I urge the government to seriously consider the proposition that has been put forward and supported by a number of independent experts to reopen the east-west runway at Sydney's international airport&mdash;it has been supported by about six different independent experts&mdash;and run it safely. I urge the government to equitably distribute the noise pollution in Sydney. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) has again addressed us with comments that show those opposite have one view in the morning and a different view in the afternoon. The reality is that the National Party and the Liberal Party have long advocated the selling off of our nation's airports&mdash;right back from the late 1970s and the early 1980s. If one looks back at what airport services were available then and what the situation facing regional airports was then, had that policy been implemented then, regional Australia would be in a much worse position today in respect of air services than it is as a result of the Federal Airports Corporation and as a result of government investment in those other airports through the Australian local ownership plan. You cannot have it both ways. You can't be a little bit pregnant: either you are or you aren't. If you want regional Australia to have access to better air services, I suggest that you look at revising your policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come to the latest stump over Sydney airport: to be trying to tag on to that airport operations linked to the passage of this legislation is the height of irresponsibility. We have to remember that as far back as the 1970s the opposition were pushing for a third runway, particularly people from country Australia. There was a great campaign around New South Wales. All the mayors and shire presidents were running a campaign calling for a third runway. They all wanted the benefit of a third runway at somebody else's disturbance. It was the nimby syndrome&mdash;not in my backyard. They wanted the people of Sydney to put up with the noise so they could utilise the service when they felt like ducking down to Sydney. There is merit in both arguments. But taking one view only is not the way to resolve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it very clear: in my view, there is far too much glamour, far too much exaggeration and far too much importance attached to air travel as a form of transport. It is simply regular public transport. If it was regarded more often as being simply a form of public transport, we could sweep away some of the gold plating and concentrate more on ensuring that air travel as a major form of public transport was available to as many Australians as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hold the very firm view that all Australians ought to have access to that network and ought to have access to the opportunity to travel between Sydney and Melbourne or Brisbane, or whatever the major ports are, in an hour or an hour and a quarter, as do those who happen to live in those areas. Regional airports and regional travellers have to have access into the hubs&mdash;but if we just concentrated on ensuring the service was available as a form of public transport and not looking upon it as a milch cow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably over the years what has happened is that here in this citadel of wisdom in Canberra many bureaucrats in Finance, Treasury and Prime Minister and Cabinet have seen airports and airline services and `cost recovery' in that area as milch cows rather than simply looking at it as a form of public transport. I sometimes feel sympathy for the people in the Department of Transport who have to be at the coalface and cop the flack, but there is no way in the world that those three bureaucratic departments would put forward the same proposals for the same level of cost recovery and revenue generation from surface passenger transport. The answer is very simple. They will not do so because the political backlash would be far too great; they could not withstand that. The old silvertail syndrome in Canberra has always applied to air travellers: `You wouldn't be flying unless you could afford to, so why shouldn't you pay it?' It ought to be seen as a form of public transport providing a reasonable return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far too little recognition is given to the importance of an airport. Airports&mdash;there is some disturbance factor and one has to manage that in the best interests of all concerned, particularly the residents in the area where the airport happens to be&mdash;are major economic generators. Taking the example of Sydney airport, and looking at the 1988-89 figures, Dr Paul Hooper from the Institute of Transport Studies at the University of Sydney is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sydney airport traffic generates 59,000 jobs in Sydney and the economic impact of the facility should be taken into account when airport policy is being debated. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He said that five per cent of jobs in New South Wales could be attributed to international visitors. In 1988-89, $5.4 billion in net income in that state came from visitors. Yet the airport is seen as a disability, as a weakness, rather than a strength. New South Wales as an economy, as a state, is extremely fortunate to have a traffic and an economic generator as it has in Mascot and being the prime port of entry for overseas visitors. Tourism is constantly referred to as the key. Airports are the key. The careers, the jobs, the revenues to governments&mdash;state, federal and local&mdash;and the revenue that goes to people who work in those operations and related activities depend on having access to an airport that is available and an airport that is recognised for its own importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the honourable member say something about aeronautical versus non-aeronautical charges. I will say only a couple of words about that at the moment as I will come back to it in a few minutes. Those revenues&mdash;aeronautical revenue and non-aeronautical revenue&mdash;are inseparably linked. You can have aeronautical revenue with little non-aeronautical activity but you cannot have non-aeronautical activity or revenues of any substance without aeronautical services. The aeronautical services beget the non-aeronautical services. I will deal with that in a bit more detail as I go through it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to another matter. It would help governments of whatever colour at whatever level&mdash;and certainly the industry&mdash;a great deal if politicians and governments dealing with airport related activities and air transport related activities put realistic expectations upon what can happen and what ought to be happening. </PARA>

Everybody hopes that it will be their new airport, and when they build that airport and the aeroplanes come down then prosperity will change forever. That cargo cult exists in much of Australia and in the minds of politicians at all levels of government. If we want to get the right decisions, and the best for people who want to use air services, we must leave that big fleet of white planes circling in the sky up there, concentrate on the reality and have realistic expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was the person who put together the concept of the Federal Airports Corporation as the father of the Federal Airports Corporation. I was looking at other arrangements across the world in the late 1970s and I formed the concept of the Federal Airports Corporation in my mind. Originally it was going to be a national airports authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Deputy Clerk is looking for that fleet of aeroplanes. You can see it through the skylight up there. She is looking; it is at about a 70-degree angle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was putting the concept of the Federal Airports Corporation together, it was in recognition that at that time the governments of the day did not know what airport and aviation related services cost and it was impossible, from the information available, to directly relate expenditure to the earning of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition wanted to sell the airports at that time. The value of departmental assets&mdash;they were all administered by the Department of Aviation at that time&mdash;was $661 million at the end of June 1982. Today the value of the 22 airports administered by the Federal Airports Corporation is just over $2 billion. Let us go back to those figures. The reason I put the proposal together was that we had no efficient way of knowing what the value of the assets was or of relating expenditure to revenue earnings. Despite the processes of the bureaucracy, it was extremely difficult to get government to spend money at the airports where it was needed. The main reason Canberra airport was not upgraded at the time was that Canberra was seen to be a public service town. It did not matter that it was one of the airports of growing importance. It was simply that Canberra was a public service town, and it was Canberra, and that was the last place you would spend any money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were massive sums of public funds involved. There was no proper measure of financial performance or efficiency of government airport operations. Because air navigation charges were levied on a route annual charge, revenue could not be related to specific airports. The airports themselves were not on a proper commercial accounting basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we set up the FAC back in 1986, the first meeting of the board of the airports corporation was in the training room in the Department of Aviation in Sydney. The very first instruction concerned the fact that airports are like shopping centres. Airports are facilities through which people pass on the way to their destination. People do not visit the airport. People may see people off at the airport and meet people at the airport, but they do not visit the airport. They pass through the airport to get to where they want to get to. Airports are like shopping centres, and airports are places where people gather on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That first instruction I gave to the FAC was that we should look at every possible service that could be provided to those people visiting airports and passing through airports, and so add to revenue. It was recognised, with the 12 airports that we started, that some would have losses: we were a young country, we were a market that had to grow, and some airports would have difficulty in reaching the standard of others for quite some years to come. There was a clear strategy and a clear plan. We had to give the airports access to the capital they needed to upgrade. Sydney is a fine example. Then we had to see that the whole network operated together. The FAC network now has 22 airports and is one of the largest airport networks in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud of the FAC&mdash;its board, management and employees. I think they have served Australia well. They have given this country over the period from 1986 to 1995 a much better level and adequacy of airport services than would have been available by any other means. A lot of effort was put into that by those officers, and I want to put on the record here in this place my appreciation of that and my congratulations to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now when we move on and look at the needs and the performance of airports, we see that overall in 1993-94 some 50 million passengers passed through the 22 airports under the FAC's control. Of those 50 million passengers, 38 1/2 million had a domestic origin and destination, 10.4 million were international passengers arriving and departing and 1.04 million were international passengers on on-carriage. How does that relate to the number of aircraft movements at airports and all the other activities? In 1993-94 there were 660,000 regular public transport movements&mdash;that is, by aircraft that are operated by airlines like Qantas, Ansett, Hazelton and the other major airlines. General aviation had 2.44 million aircraft movements. That is a total of 3.1 million aircraft movements overall. We will see when we look more closely at the figures later that the vast majority of passengers carried were RPT&mdash;regular public transport&mdash;activity. It is the minority of aircraft movements that carry the vast majority of aircraft passengers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total non-aeronautical revenue for that year was $279 million. The total aeronautical revenue was $178 million, with rounding, which gives a revenue total of $457 million for the FAC in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred earlier to non-aeronautical activity. You cannot have non-aeronautical services in an airport without an airport. It is ludicrous to suggest, as the Prices Surveillance Authority does in what I see as pure theoretical reasoning, that somehow non-aeronautical activity should be separate and not regarded as part of revenue earning by the airport and earnings from the industry. You just cannot do it. They are inseparably linked. You can put the shops and all of the other services out in the paddock and leave them there but unless there are aircraft landing at the airport no passengers are going to come, no visitors or meeters and greeters are going to visit, so the revenue is not going to be there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the very clear intention at the time the FAC was set up that non-aeronautical revenue was a field that had not been exploited. There was a major source of revenue to be developed, and it has been developed. The FAC has been excellent at doing it. That revenue should go to supplement the other revenue earned from the actual air travel, as distinct from the land travel of the total journey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at all of the forecasts that are put to us about air transport and airline movements and the development of airports, I want to turn to the national planning transport task force report on adequacy of transport infrastructure at airports. That report was brought down at the end of last year. It said that aviation infrastructure investment of at least $2.8 billion is likely to be required between 1995-96 and 2014-15. More than two-thirds&mdash;67 per cent&mdash;of that total expenditure need will be on terminal expansion. Of the total terminal investment, 41 per cent will be required at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one turns over to see what will happen to airports and their importance in the handling of passengers, we see that by 2014-15 Sydney will be the No. 1 airport, as forecast, Melbourne No. 2, Brisbane No. 3 and Cairns No. 4. If I turn back and look at the actual passenger movement, we see that in the Sydney basin, which by that time will be taking in Sydney West and Sydney, the number of passengers is expected to accelerate from 17.9 million in 1995-96 to 36.8 million in 2014-15&mdash;a 105 per cent increase. Cairns will go up by 209.6 per cent and Coolangatta by 155 per cent. Overall, the number of passengers handled&mdash;domestic, international and on-carriage&mdash;in Australia by 2014 will grow from 54,800,000 this year to 113 million by 2014-15. That is a 106 per cent increase. Similarly, when we look at air cargo&mdash;that is the other issue that is coming up increasingly&mdash;and its availability and the growth in it, we see that the figure of 789,000 tonnes for this year, 1995-96, is expected to grow by 73.3 per cent in 2014-15 to 1,368,500 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at those figures, they put a little bit of soberness on some of the numbers we hear lauded about the place. In all of these things&mdash;I was saying this a few minutes ago&mdash;we need to have our feet firmly on the ground and deal with realistic estimates and realistic expectations and leave that great fleet of planes that the Deputy Clerk was watching circling way above us.

He has a capacity to draw the great themes and ideas of transport and put them into practical terms. Instead we are now dealing with legislation proposed by the current Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). He as an individual and his manner of operating really does not create a sense of confidence either in the Australian electorate or in members of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation that the House is dealing with sets out the proposal that the government lease the major airports around Australia. They will not be selling them, they will be leasing them, but retaining for the Commonwealth some major areas of control. It is a half good, half bad sort of result if you come to analyse it. The people of Australia will need to keep a close eye on the behaviour of the minister and the way in which this process goes into operation because the truth is, as in many areas where the government is uncertain of itself, that it puts a framework of legislation in place and at later stages fleshes out that framework with a multiplicity of regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That delegated legislation process will enable us to finally have simple and clear legislation. This legislation is far from simple and far from clear and will worry a great number of people as its significance unfolds upon them. Already in this simple legislation we have three amendments to the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1995 to be moved on behalf of the opposition and five amendments to be moved by the government&mdash;and it is simple legislation. One hates to think&mdash;one shudders&mdash;when one considers the regulations and the multiplicity of activity that those regulations will control when brought into place. I confess that I can see real complexity and disaster ahead for the aviation industry in Australia. I see no clarity of thought. I see a mishmash of political ideology&mdash;a process that the minister has inherited from his term in office in New South Wales to fiddle in a political sense with what should be really clear and important economic decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to briefly run through some of the main flaws that I see in the legislation and then deal with the opposition's proposal that none of this go ahead until the government reopens the east-west runway. That is a significant thing and something that the opposition stands by. The government has provided in the minister's second reading speech an outline of the future operational responsibilities for airports and the consideration of Sydney West as it is linked with Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice in the government's policy that the airports will be majority Australian owned. Australia will own 51 per cent. Unless one of the owners happens to be a friend of the government, such as Mr Murdoch or Mr Packer, those rules will be changed. I accuse the government of misleading the parliament in this area because they have no intention of sticking to the 49 per cent foreign ownership rule. They will change it at the drop of a hat if a powerful friend makes them a better offer or where they can see a better deal or where they can see that the process is failing and they need an extra injection of funds. They have done it time and again: they have done it within media ownership and control, they have done it with pay and cable television and they have done it with the Commonwealth Bank. First of all, they were not going to sell the Commonwealth Bank and, ultimately, they are selling the whole of the Commonwealth Bank. They did it with Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just another instance where in order to balance their failing budgets the government has sold more and more of Australia to overseas interests. It will be the same with the airports. The government should have the decency and the honesty to set out their real intention, because the Australian people are sick and tired of this sophistry of making a claim and then finding that they cannot match their claim or promise and they ultimately sell more and more of Australia to anybody who comes along, particularly if they are a rich and powerful friend like a media baron. The legislation is changed specifically for those people. In fact, the media ownership legislation was changed to accommodate a non-Australian citizen in an area that was reserved for Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will also seek diversity of ownership to the maximum extent possible. That is similar to what happened with the television licenses. The government will also encourage transparency and benchmark competition between the airports. They are high sounding words, but we know the complexity of the way in which the competition commission will work, the formulas that they will develop and the rules that they will devise, which will be incomprehensible to most Australians. Whilst talking about transparency on the one hand, on the other the government provides a screen behind which the operations of airports can hide from the gaze of the public. As a minimum there will be separate ownership, except in Sydney where Sydney and Sydney West will be linked. If you own Sydney and Sydney West, I understand that you cannot link Brisbane and Melbourne with that airport, but you may be able to link others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these rules, including the rule that the ownership of airports by individual airlines and associated interests will be restricted to five per cent, are just like the  ownership rules of media. It does not matter whether it is newspapers, television, pay television or cable television&mdash;these are all subject to change on the whim of the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to point out to the House that this legislation has maximum ministerial interest, oversight and control because there is hardly a process in the whole legislation that does not finish up with the minister having to give each item his tick. Whether it is land planning provisions, the standards observed within airports or the processes of master plans, development of plans of any projects, including runways, terminals and other developments, and environmental impact assessments all have to get the ministerial tick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also requires that the operators, as I have said, have certain limitations placed on them. This is all under the ministerial control of the Minister for Transport. The minister's second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is, in particular, substantial scope to protect areas surrounding the major airports from residential and other development incompatible with the long-term use of the airport.</PARA>
<PARA>It is to be under ministerial control, but the minister expects the cooperation of states in this process. He expects the cooperation of states because he recognises the constitutional limitation on what he can do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But one only has to look at Sydney to understand how the minister has failed to gain the cooperation of states and the cooperation of the community. One only has to look at the press reports relating to the Hon. Jeannette McHugh. There has been protest after protest in the area of Sydenham, where, according to a representative of the Marrickville No Aircraft Noise Party, a suburb in a Labor electorate is being demolished. So here we have houses which have been lived in by Labor supporters being bulldozed in Labor electorates, and we have the minister saying in his second reading speech that he will get the cooperation of the states in all of this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the minister will get the support he wants. We have seen how he behaves when he does get support. He bulldozes houses to clear people out of properties they have lived in for years. It is a shameful day for the Australian Labor Party with what they have done around the Sydney airport. They are going to do more. The western Sydney airport promises to be just as difficult because across Sydney, I inform the House, group after group is jumping up to protest. These groups now suddenly understand what will happen when Sydney West opens and aircraft are flying over their properties and destroying their peace and their lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These groups are growing in numbers because the government has failed to communicate and they distrust the minister. They have seen what the minister has done in relation to Sydney (Kingsford Smith), and they do not trust him to tell them the truth or to communicate effectively. The result of the minister's failure to communicate or to effectively explain what he has in mind about Sydney (Kingsford Smith) has resulted in the bulldozing of houses of Labor supporters. So why would people trust the current minister?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister leaves everything out of the agenda. He tries to cover up the issues. Curfews, runway operations, flight paths, noise, and acquisition and insulation programs are the minister's responsibility, as outlined in his speech. They are the responsibility of the minister, and the minister is bulldozing houses. I think that is deplorable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer the House to the decision by the opposition to oppose this sale or leasing of airports until the east-west runway is opened. The current situation is&mdash;I will hold up this map so that the House can see it&mdash;that aircraft fly through what I call `Laurie's loop'. They come up from the south and head straight for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) until they are about 10 miles away from the airport. When they are above densely populated areas they do a left-hand turn and fly out to the west of Sydney, out to the area around Pennant Hills, Baulkham Hills and North Rocks, which is in the electorate of Mitchell. They then fly over Parramatta and turn in a southerly direction to come in and land in a southerly direction on the north-south runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Laurie, in his maddest dreams, had tried to find a flight path that inconvenienced more people, he could not have found it. The fact of the matter is that this Laurie's loop, as I have called it, covers almost the totality of Sydney. If you are going to do anything dangerous or stupid, you would fly aircraft over houses. That is what this map shows&mdash;that aircraft are covering the maximum extent of Sydney that they can. The only way that you could cover a greater number of houses with this process would be to fly aircraft zigzag across Sydney and try to cover every single house. There is no logic in this process. Every resident of the city of Sydney is disadvantaged by the current processes and landing patterns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we examine what has happened, we see 40 per cent of aircraft used to come in from the southerly route and come straight in and land on that east-west runway. That 40 per cent have been diverted all over the countryside&mdash;out through Hurstville, over Parramatta, around through Pennant Hills and west Pymble and right back through the electorates of Lowe and Bennelong&mdash;to land from the south at Sydney (Kingsford Smith). It is no wonder Labor Party members are being abused and no wonder Liberal Party members are being abused, because Laurie has developed this loop to cause the maximum inconvenience to everybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aircraft are flying at 3,000 feet at 80 per cent power. To me, that seems a crazy process too. Why has this been devised? Is this a plot by the minister to make it hard for everybody in Sydney? That appears to be the case. Laurie's loop means that every individual&mdash;particularly if we take in the likely flight paths of commercial aircraft inbound from the north, where they can go over the peninsula and come in across the top to join the loop or they can fly around and cover the Cronulla area&mdash;is being inconvenienced and every house is being placed at some risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought the simplest and the most safety conscious process would be to fly aircraft in by the shortest route across houses and land. That is not being done in Sydney. I do not know what inspires the minister to say that this is the safest and the best process. I guess that he wants to lose seats. I can assure him that the people of Sydney understand what is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister says, and has said, that the use of the east-west runway in Sydney is a dangerous process. He denies that we have used that successfully from practically the commencement of Sydney (Kingsford Smith). The American consulting company Flight Transportation Associates provided a report for the department and the minister saying that they can up the throughput of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) to 94 planes per hour by using cross-runways. The minister does not seem to know about that report. He has not mentioned it in any of his comments, although it was raised with him by Kerry O'Brien when he did an interview with the minister on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> on 23 November 1994, about a year ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have experts saying that Sydney (Kingsford Smith) can be successfully used if there is an east-west runway operating. Max Hazelton, one of the doyens of Australian fliers, a great aviator and a man with huge success with all sorts of aircraft, agrees. Dr Fred Bell, consultant to the airport coordinating task force in 1990; Dr Jean Cross, Professor of Safety Science at the University of New South Wales; Captain Peter Skinner, President of the Australian International Pilots Association; Bill Pollard, the new chief executive of Airservices Australia; and Laurie Gruzman QC, a legal expert in aviation, all say that we can use the east-west runway and use it successfully. It is only the minister's decision that means we are not using it. I think it is wrong and the opposition is opposing this legislation, unless the government decides that it will release the east-west runway into proper use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I need to say something about the development of Sydney West, because that is a shemozzle. I have heard from the Minister for Transport that there is no rail link plan. I have here from the FAC a proposal for Sydney West airport for a 2,900-metre runway development indicative timetable. There is nothing at all there for a rail link. The planning and negotiation finishes at the end of the second quarter in 1996. There are a whole lot of things on this indicative plan that ought to have happened but have not happened. The EIS has only just commenced. It should have been running for three months. It should have started at the beginning of July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole program is running behind; yet we get press statements and releases that the bulldozers are ready to run in March. What is happening here? Has the government decided that, despite the results of the EIS, the bulldozers are going to move? That is what we are reading in the press: the bulldozers are ready to roll in March, whether or not the EIS is satisfactory. I want to hear some answers from the minister on these things. Is he going to be impeccable in his behaviour on this issue, or is he going to treat it like he does everything else&mdash;as a toy and a political plaything where truth does not count and veracity and safety of the Australian people are irrelevant?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to only look at the budget papers to find out the sophistry of this minister.

It then goes on to talk about the allocation of funds, including for rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the allocation for rail? There is none. The minister has had to admit that there is no intention to proceed to provide rail links by the time of the Olympic Games; yet he is putting out press releases saying everything is going to be fine by the time the Olympic Games come. They are lies. We know they are. If he could come clean, at least we could manage the thing. But he is not prepared to come clean with the Australian people and tell them what is going on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the most important spin-offs from all of the discussions concerning airports and their ramifications is that they have given Australians a clear indication on how the major parties in this country seek to address government to the needs of the people. While the leasing of airports is perhaps a less immediate issue to people concerned about noise or pollution from aircraft, I think it is this matter alone that really marks the difference between the government's and the opposition's desire to produce genuine solutions to the vexing questions of airports in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, I believe the whole question of airport leasing has established the government's credentials without a doubt. From this issue alone I think it is stunningly obvious that we are the only people in this chamber willing and able to accept the mantle of responsible government for all Australians. The opposition, on the other hand, due to their inadequately structured policies and their willingness to change tack on any issue when it suits them, have shown themselves to be a terrible excuse for a bunch of alternative leaders. They bark and they bark; but, when it comes down to it, they are toothless&mdash;nothing but gums flapping in the breeze over there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Airports Bill 1995 demonstrates two things above all. The first point is that we, as a government, are committed to a program of responsible and well planned micro-economic reform. The leasing of Australia's airports will deliver $2 billion into the nation's coffers&mdash;$2 billion that is an essential part of the government's future financial strategy. The second point is that we are determined to guarantee the safe and clean operation of airports by any company that holds an airport lease. Any company that enters the Australian airport market will have to be prepared to follow a rigorous set of guidelines for that airport's operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my time today I want to go through what I see are the chief issues concerning airport privatisation and, in doing so, highlight the government's ongoing commitment to pursuing a responsible airport policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seeing that an airport's effect on the environment is one of the chief concerns in the community today, let me briefly explain the bill and how it delivers in this particular area. I believe truly that there is a misconception among certain sectors of the community that, once the government begins leasing airports, the airports will suddenly cease to be under the government's control and private companies will be able to run roughshod over the public's environmental concerns and to operate in any way they see fit. If anyone reads the bills, they will understand and appreciate that nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as landlords place rules and regulations on their tenants, so will the federal government on prospective airport lessees. A lessee company must submit to the government an initial draft and then, upon approval from the minister, a final draft environmental strategy which must specify the objectives of the environmental management of the airport; the source of environmental impacts; the proposed studies, reviews and monitoring of environmental impacts from the operation of the airport; the measures to be carried out to prevent, control or to reduce environmental impacts; and details of the consultations involved in the preparation of the strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When considering approval of an environmental strategy, the minister must take into account what effect the implementation of the strategy would have on air, water and soil quality; the effect on noise levels; and details of the consultations entered into in developing that particular strategy. The minister can then refuse to grant an approval, asking the company to submit another strategy for inspection. The minister, through this legislation, has the power to refuse or approve an airport lessee's environmental strategy, just as the minister can refuse or approve an airport lessee's management plan for an airport and plans for any major building development at that airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once a draft environmental strategy has been approved, the airport lessee must make the plans available to the public for inspection and must advertise to the public that it is doing so. Failure to follow such guidelines would lead to the government imposing a fine of up to $25,000 on the company. This is just a fragment of the tight guidelines that the government will be making all airport lessees follow. There will be no plans approved under the table. </PARA>

An independent consultancy group, Axis Environmental Consultants, was appointed by the FAC in September and is now conducting air and water studies and an aircraft noise assessment for the future Sydney West airport. This study is in addition to the exhaustive environmental impact statement originally carried out in 1985 for Sydney West. Axis will also develop environmental management plans for both the construction and the operation of the new airport and will prepare a notice of intention. Once its studies are completed, it will then have to report back to the FAC and to the government. The findings will be widely discussed and broadcasted in our local communities. </PARA>

The opposition, as demonstrated by its obstinate intention to block this bill, is pursuing a course whereby it is saying, `Let's just run the train off the tracks.' Providing better airports means providing more efficient airports, which inevitably means cheaper running costs with the savings being passed down to the consumer. We believe the best way to do this is to offer their management to private enterprise. The privatisation of the airports which are presently managed by the Federal Airports Corporation is essential if this government is to meet its budgetary responsibilities. Yet on the other side of the House we have the self-proclaimed economic rationalists&mdash;the team whose political bread and butter is attempting to prove to Australians that they are the ones that should be running the economy. </PARA>

The opposition benches are creaking with the weight of them all squirming in their seats. They are mouthing off about the quality of life of people under the flight paths while at the same time they are opposing a bill that delivers on quality of life, and categorically so.

It's totally unbelievable and utterly unfeasible.' What kind of confidence can Australians have in a man that formulates policy like that? What kind of confidence can Australian business people have? With the opposition's intention to stand against the government on this bill, a move obviously made again at the drop of a hat, business people all around the country and around the world are questioning their motives.

This was five years before I entered federal parliament. It was 10 years before our current friends in the opposition attempted to gain some political mileage from objecting to airport development.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crime of it is that the opposition actually want Australia's airports privatised. It makes plain and simple sense to support this bill, but they will not. In fact, they cannot support it because of their leader's navel gazing. Never mind that if the coalition block the bill they will be condemning the largest micro-economic reform in civil aviation over the last 25 years to the backburner. Never mind that they will be knocking $2 billion out of next year's budget. Never mind that the logic behind their planned prevention of the bill is illogical and that rather than sharing the noise around, as the Leader of the Opposition so naively explains, opening the east-west runways would, apart from providing a safety risk, actually affect as many as 142,000 more people with aircraft noise. Never mind that, even if you open up the east-west runway's stub, it will increase the north-south runway's capacity for another 10 jumbos an hour. That means another 10 jumbos over the member for Bennelong's own electorate.

Rather they have seen it as just another example of a politician acting out of self-interest and being blown where the wind takes him. Australians, despite enjoying fame for being a fairly easygoing bunch, demand integrity from their politicians. They also demand leadership, decision making and the provision of a vision for the country. They are all qualities that Australians admire and respect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My association with the Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney goes back to the days when I was a child. My father knew the late Reg Follett, who was one of the pioneers of the development of Mascot airport. In those days it was I guess a sand flat, it was really a grass strip, and of course there was very little traffic. It was underdeveloped. In those days it certainly had problems when there was a lot of heavy rain. Drainage still remains a major challenge for the use of those facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is a facility which has from then, in those prewar days to now, had several advantages. Probably the most notable is that it has, because of its lie adjacent to Botany Bay, a facility to ensure that aircraft movements can be significantly over water. It probably is one of the most conveniently located international and domestic airport anywhere in the world. It is close to the CBD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, while the population centre of Sydney has moved west, and there are certainly a large number of aircraft movements in and out of Bankstown airport, the character and nature of passenger traffic increasingly is either to the central business district&mdash;and that is where a large percentage of the intrastate traffic moves&mdash;or to the hotels which, again, are largely located around that central heart of Sydney. It is to that heartland that, of course, so many international visitors first go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the Olympics 2000, the Olympic Games and all the tourist potential there, that will be out to the Homebush region of Sydney. In that instance I have no doubt that many tourists will want to go and live down by the waterfront. They will want to enjoy the magnificent beaches that are along that eastern strip of coastline adjacent to Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me about this whole proposal in the legislation before us is that it shows a government not knowing what it is going to do to provide better access to Sydney. This government has not looked at all the alternatives and tried to provide the maximum traffic flow through this airport as it is now and as it may be developed in the future. This government is really trying to ensure that, to the maximum, it contains what it sees as the political threat to its own seats in the Sydney metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to speak on this debate for several reasons. One is that I am concerned for those who live in rural New South Wales. I think it is important that people do not just look at Mascot as an international airport but understand that, unlike most other states, there has been enormous growth in intrastate traffic to Mascot. Indeed, East West Airlines, which unfortunately is now a part of Ansett, developed a major intrastate service in the postwar years. The late Don Shand and his colleagues in setting up, with very small and humble beginnings, such a service really ensured that country centres&mdash;like that which you represent, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, and Tamworth and the south and the west of New South Wales&mdash;were among the first centres in Australia to really enjoy a better than average air service and, consequently, an accelerated access to the centre of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no use saying to those people on those services, `We're going to put you out to some new airport way out at Badgerys Creek.' They are not interested in that. What they want to do is to see how, to the maximum, they can maintain access to the central business district, so that they can come down to Sydney in the morning and do their business and return home at night. If it is for tourists, they too, in my view, do not want to go to Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know other countries are developing international airports, some of which are a long way from the heart of their city. I know that, in the days to come, Sydney certainly needs a second airport. But I remain to be convinced that Badgerys Creek is the site. Having had a look at Badgerys Creek and knowing the undulating terrain, seeing the infrastructure and the lack of reasonable access there, all the plans that we hear from the government seem to me to be all predicated on a political agenda rather than a rational assessment of what the long-term future will be of an airport built out there at Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made the point on other occasions in this place that for the life of me I cannot understand how an airport in the most rapidly developing urban area of outer Sydney, where all take-offs and landings have to be over land, is not&mdash;in the course of the next 20 years, if not a little longer&mdash;going to become far more a source of noise contamination and pollution than that at Mascot. At Mascot, certainly with the north-south take-offs and landings, 50 per cent of landings and take-offs are over sea and 50 per cent over land. The significance of Mascot is that it has other advantages that Badgerys Creek demonstrably lacks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I started by saying that I am concerned about the maintenance of maximum possible access to Mascot in the future. And I continue by saying that I do not know whether the Badgerys Creek site is the best one for future development for international and domestic air services into Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not easy developing a site for a second airfield. I have been very taken by the ideas that I have read in recent times about an inquiry into a major new freight centre somewhere out of Sydney. I know centres around New South Wales, including Canberra, have been putting in their bids for consideration to be a new international airfreight hub. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to develop such an airfreight hub, I question whether it might not be better to think of allowing those airfreight aircraft to carry passengers to supplement the loadings and to make sure the economics of that international air hub would be better than would otherwise be the case. It might allow a significant development which would allow, therefore, other means of transporting people from wherever that international hub is outside Sydney in a way which will overcome the need for that second Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are going to look at going to Badgerys Creek and at the time taken to travel from Badgerys Creek to the CBD in Sydney, I am not convinced that it would not be possible to find some such hub out of Sydney with either a very fast train or some other communication which might ensure that you do not have to develop that second Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is about selling the airport. It is legislation which is designed to get the government out of its financial quandary. It is not legislation designed to provide better air services. It is not legislation designed in any way to overcome aircraft noise. It is not legislation in any way related to trying to meet the tourist needs of Sydney in the future. It is all about trying to privatise the airports around Australia and about the government getting more money to operate. I am in favour of privatisation, but I am not in favour of trying to develop legislation only to get money for the government without looking at all those wider problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned that, as far as Mascot is concerned, there are a number of significant matters that, to my mind, have not been satisfactorily answered. I do not follow why using two parallel runways exclusively in any way can be seen to be an efficient management of aircraft movements to and from Sydney. If we look at the direction in which aircraft approach Sydney, we see that there are a minimal number at this time that can fly straight into Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it impossible to understand why, in the control of aircraft movements, nearly every aircraft movement into Sydney is subject to some sort of a delay. Those of us who, as members of parliament, use Sydney quite extensively and access Mascot airport frequently by air know that you come in from Canberra and you finish up coming in from the south. You run over Warragamba Dam, you probably approach Sydney on the south western precincts and you run up over the west. You are just as likely to come in from the north and the aircraft will probably be down at 5,000 feet for a large part of that approach into Sydney. The noise contamination is just inexcusable. The delays into Mascot cost time and money and add to air pollution, fuel consumption and passenger costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that as far as this bill is concerned privatisation really relates only to the ownership of the airport precincts, but Mascot has to be operated efficiently because it is to be licensed as an airport, as will all the other airports to be sold. It has to take into account how you are going to reasonably be able to operate efficiently and accurately into these airports with maximum safety but also with minimal time delays and, hopefully, minimal aircraft noise contamination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until there is a reasonable and rational use of Mascot airport, I do not believe anyone can say that the time has arrived for this bill to be put into effect. It is for that reason, and because I absolutely despair of the management of the whole air transport industry as well as other aspects of the portfolio of the present minister, that I suspect this legislation must be deferred until the change of government, after the next federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have several other worries about the whole of the present use of Mascot. When you turn back to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> report of 23 March 1989, which detailed the marathon cabinet process which led to the approval for the third runway, you realise that some of the problems that exist now in the structure of the airport are unlikely to be solved if the airport is presently privatised and if the present government is put in charge of the whole process. I will comment a little more on the content of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That approval ensured that, instead of the third runway bringing aircraft somewhere close to the hangars and to the terminal, it has been pushed right out into the bay. As a result, aircraft come down on the approach from the northern precincts far lower over the buildings and the occupied area than is necessary. Then they have to taxi for an extraordinarily long distance before they get back to the main hangars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would be much better off with the plans of the third runway that the coalition approved in 1982, put up by the Hon. Wal Fife, the then minister for aviation. I am satisfied that if that runway had been built we would be so much better off. Instead of that, with the parallel runways we have now we have houses being pulled down in Labor areas. We have all sorts of supposed measures being taken to contain noise contamination. Why? It is because the aircraft are not being managed in the right way in their approach and take-off to Mascot. It is that mess that this bill seeks to transform in some way by privatising the airport. To my mind, unless you approach those other areas adequately, you are just not going to resolve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the article of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. It says that it is not the Minister for Transport presently in the Keating ministry who is responsible but that it is the Prime Minister himself. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, Mr Keating, Mr Hawke and the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, met to discuss the issue. Mr Keating's concern was that the third runway&mdash;north to south with aircraft landing and taking off only to the south over Botany Bay&mdash;would have only a marginal impact on the airport's capacity, would require the Badgerys Creek airport to be developed relatively quickly [by the mid-1990s] and would not relieve noise problems associated with the east-west runway. After looking at various configurations, Mr Keating proposed that the new north-south runway be fully operational from both directions and the old east-west runway be virtually made redundant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That article is an accurate reflection of the reason many of the problems presently being suffered at Mascot need to be sheeted home to the Prime Minister. In other words, the original proposal of the third runway was that aircraft should take off only to the south and land from the south so that they flew over water rather than houses. What did the Prime Minister do? He changed that. He sent them roaring over suburbia. So all the problems in Sydney are not specifically the responsibility of Minister Brereton. They are the responsibility of the Prime Minister and his intervention in the cabinet process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind, to proceed with the sale of Mascot airport in circumstances where those aircraft movements are only permitted in that narrow configuration on the two parallel runways, with a significant number of take-offs and landings over land and without use of the cross-runway, is madness. If you think, `That is in some way going to prejudice airport safety,' you have to remember the evidence Dr Fred Bell, of F&amp;J Bell and Associates Environmental Consulting, gave in a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 1 October this year. He was a consultant to the Airport Coordinating Taskforce in 1990 and he had to look at the third runway impact and the extent to which the third runway was going to increase or otherwise the prospects of some sort of an aircraft accident on the tarmac. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)the risks of fatal aircraft collisions on the tarmac are much lower than the risks of fatal crashes of airborne planes in the flightpaths . . . and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)the risks to flightpath residents of crashes from airborne planes are greater with the concentrated flight patterns of the parallel runways than with the dispersed flight patterns of crossed runway operations.</PARA>
<PARA>In terms of safety, you have an environmental assessor who says that, with the closeness of the parallel runways, the risks to flight path residents of crashes are greater than with the dispersed flight patterns of crossed runway operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned before the problem we are all conscious of as we fly into and out of Mascot; that is, so many aircraft traverse the city in order to land on those two parallel runways. I have done flown into Sydney twice in the last three weeks. I have been in the air with aircraft not very far away from the aircraft I am in. Many of them are at a distance not that far from where we are travelling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns me that without using the cross-runway you still have a very high risk&mdash;I am not too sure of the measure of that risk&mdash;of aircraft flying on a collision course through the very fact that they are forced to cross the city in order to use the parallel runways. That is not on the ground; it is in the air. That is an extension of what, to my mind, Dr Bell was commenting on in that letter of his. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that there are four things that need to be considered before this airport is sold. As far as the safety of Mascot is concerned, I believe it is absolutely essential that you get aircraft directed into Sydney by the most efficient and shortest route. That means when you allocate slot times you should allow not for the aircraft to traverse Sydney before it comes into land but to the maximum have aircraft landing and taking off over water, to the maximum ensure that in their flight path you direct them, as near as possible, towards a direct approach into Mascot from as far out as you can. It is possible. It used to be done when the cross-runway was used. That will save time, ensure aircraft are not approaching Mascot in a way to accelerate the noise contamination, and will ensure more economic use of the airport and more economic travel by the aircraft themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing which is absolutely essential is another survey. I know we have had many of them, but I am not happy about Badgerys Creek. I remain to be convinced that the present plans for Badgerys Creek in any way are going to save the traffic flow out of Mascot. I believe the long-term potential of development in the Badgerys Creek area is likely to exacerbate noise contamination in the western part of Sydney in a way which is going to be far worse than presently occurs at Mascot. It is no use the government today saying, `We are going out to Badgerys Creek to save your problem in Mascot.' All you are going to do is create a problem in 20, 30 or 40 years time. I do not see that as the answer to Sydney's problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing is that, as far as the sale of this airport is concerned, I believe it would be improper to proceed, not only on the basis of the amendment moved by the opposition&mdash;that is, until the cross-runway is open&mdash;but until there has been more efficient and less politically motivated direction of aircraft traffic movements around Mascot than is presently the case. I think there is a real problem not peculiarly in Mascot but around Australia because of the problems of Mascot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is not really designed to meet the needs of the travelling aircraft public of Australia but to meet the financial needs of this government. For that reason, the bill should be deferred. I support totally the amendment moved by the opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Airports Bill represents what must be the nadir of the government's 13 years in office. It confirms that the government not only has been a coalition government in drag but has consistently served the special interests rather than the public interests. It is probably the final betrayal of its constituency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hawke-Keating government since 1983 has done most of the fundamental things that the Fraser-Howard government of 1975-83 promised to do but did not do&mdash;deregulation, asset selling, privatisation, the rich getting richer and the neutering of the union movement, to mention but a few things. At least a coalition government would have been more honest and the Labor constituency could have fully vented its opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a bill to privatise Australia's airports. Let no-one be deluded by the term `lease'. Leasing for 99 years, under the terms set out in this bill, is effectively forever. All the options for the future of Australia's air services to be operated in the national interest or even the local public interest at specific airports will be closed off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inevitable problems that will emerge in the future both on a national and local basis will be resolved in the private interest. It is almost unbelievable that the government could propose such a course given the disastrous situation at Sydney airport&mdash;a disaster which is largely the result of the government's mismanagement since 1983; a stewardship which at every twist and turn has been for the benefit of the airlines and in contempt of the people of Sydney and the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill entrenches not only all the current problems at Sydney and other airports but locks up the future for over a century. What has happened at Sydney over its 50 years of development will be repeated at many other sites&mdash;Melbourne, Brisbane, Cairns, and even places like Broome. The writing is already on the wall for the relatively short-term future at these airports, let alone 99 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airport traffic will eventually grow, more space will be required, urban areas will inevitably expand, and patterns of air traffic in Australia will change as will management and technology. Yet all this will be resolved in the interests of a series of private companies and the public will be left virtually powerless to the mercies of private profit&mdash;a complete abandonment of the role of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Make no mistake; all the paraphernalia of regulation in the bills with respect to controls on foreign ownership, diversity of ownership, existing airlines and the limitations of land use is so much window-dressing. All that can and will change on demand just as have similar so-called controls on foreign ownership generally or media regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airports of the future will be vast complexes of wide ranging commercial activities such as supermarkets, offices and entertainment facilities, all totally excluded from any local or state controls&mdash;one law for the public and another for the government's favourite sons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Future problems will be dealt with by the minister of the day with `That's commercial-in-confidence' and `We can't afford the massive compensation that that would involve.' The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) shows no concern for or recognition of these problems or even of the current problems of Sydney residents. His main concern seems to be, using his words, `inconveniencing foreign interests'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, most of the minister's speech reminds me of the manufacturers of the Auschwitz gas chambers extolling the quality, manufacturing techniques and delivery times as recorded in the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</EMPHASIS>. He seems oblivious to the long-term future of residents of Sydney and other cities around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that here in Canberra, among the government, the bureaucracy, the press gallery and even among many members, Sydney airport is considered a minor local issue affecting two or three seats out of 147 at the next election. The government apparently sees only the noise problem and even that in only political terms. Its approach of concentrating the noise on as few voters as possible is cynical and brutal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill ensures that Badgerys Creek will never be more than a minor overflow airport. It maximises aircraft movements at Kingsford Smith, cuts off options for the future, ensures that the massive public subsidies to the airlines continue, ensures the control of the airport by Ansett and Qantas, cutting off competition, ensures the airport remains a third-rate airport, ensures the urban blight of Sydney will continue and ensures that thousands will continue to be exposed to massive health hazards from noise, carcinogens and the ever present threat of airline accidents. It represents an environmental and economic disaster unrivalled in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sydney is Australia's largest city. It contains almost a quarter of Australia's population. Forty years ago only a few thousand were affected by noise, which was only a fraction of the intensity that perhaps over 100,000 endure today. Some 28 suburbs are now affected by aircraft noise far in excess of acceptable health standards. Doctors are now seeing increasing numbers of people suffering from sleep deprivation, headaches, stress, and respiratory and hearing problems. These problems can only increase and will lead to endless future litigation. Yet the noise is only one problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Abundant evidence has been given by some doctors concerning the nightmarish effect of the carcinogenic hydrocarbons emitted from engine exhausts. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> of 7 May 1995 reported, `In Sydney the exhausts from thousands of planes will kill people. Nobody in the government or the aviation industry will yet recognise this.' Yet this bill entrenches and expands these problems for the long-term future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill ensures that Qantas and Ansett will continue to expand at Kingsford Smith, safe from effective competition&mdash;safe with their 30-year leases secretly negotiated in an obscene deal at Kirribilli in the late 1980s. The bill attempts to ensure not only by the leasing of Kingsford Smith but also by leasing Sydney West to the same owners that Sydney West will only remain a minor overflow airport. There is no incentive to develop it and in fact every incentive to expand Kingsford Smith for international and interstate aircraft, with general aviation and regional airlines gradually forced out to Sydney West. The bill thus provides for a maximising of large jet movements and passengers at Kingsford Smith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government seems intent on piling horror on horror for Sydney residents. In December 1990, in opposing the expansion of Kingsford Smith by the construction of the third runway, I said:</PARA>

For them it is not just a matter of annoyance noise, it is vibration that cracks walls, and noise and kerosene from jets that seriously damages health. It is slow extermination of postcode 2044 as a residential area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The famous poem <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Man from Snowy River</EMPHASIS> was first published this day 100 years ago. The publication of this magnificent poem is being celebrated in Corryong in the upper Murray in my electorate. Many people from around the world and Australia are going to be there over the next few days to join in those celebrations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought I would take this opportunity to pay tribute to Banjo Paterson and his poem and mention briefly my view of what the poem means to Australians 100 years since it was first published. I think most Australians would take this poem as their favourite as it represents many aspects of the nation. Many Australians respond when they hear the words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the colt from old Regret had got away. . . </PARA>
<PARA>They are very familiar words and they bring back many memories to Australians overseas when they hear them. The poem is about the men, the people and the wild bush horses from the rugged mountains, rivers and streams in the alpine, Kosciusko and upper Murray area. The words state that the horse&mdash;`he was worth a thousand pound'&mdash;had gone off with the wild horses and everyone had gathered to go and find it and bring it back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Man from Snowy River</EMPHASIS> is an entertaining, evergreen poem. As a national poem, it has endured for 100 years and it will continue to do so. It tells us a lot about our nation and it reflects on the mystic relationship between horse and man. For a poem to live as long as this, it has to mean a lot to Australians. Being set in the magnificent and beautiful country which I am so proud of and which many Australians love to visit is very appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also some controversy with the poem because it celebrates the anonymous battler, the person who was to ride and find this famous horse and bring it back. There is much controversy and legend as well as some stories that are hard to believe about who that famous battler was. But the people of Corryong know who he was. He was Jack Riley, who is buried in the Corryong cemetery. He died in 1914, and on his gravestone in Corryong are the words `The Man from Snowy River'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To doubting Thomases who say that this person was someone else or that it was just the imagination of the poet, I say that no-one else has a grave with those words on it, and that sort of evidence is irrefutable. So the legend lives on. I congratulate the committee and the people of the upper Murray for their wonderful festival and for the traditions which they preserve, respect and use to help Australians celebrate and remember their history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk about an announcement made last week by the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) at the ACOSS annual conference regarding a pilot proposal for homeless young Australians. I think the proposal put forward by the member for Bennelong is unacceptable, as it should be to all members of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I had the privilege of tabling a report on youth homelessness in June following an extensive nationwide inquiry. That report dealt in great detail with the issues, characteristics and problems relating to youth homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal put forward by the member for Bennelong indicates the introduction of a six-week transitional payment to be managed by a voluntary agency, which must take all appropriate steps to mediate a reconciliation with the young person's family or guardian. The intent of that part of the proposal is to introduce compulsory mediation as a requirement for financial support. Effectively, it means that abused young people who seek assistance from the government would have to agree to participate in meetings with their abusers before they gained financial support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry there was very strong evidence that mediation can be a very effective and beneficial vehicle for reconciling families, but only when it is voluntary. The idea of compulsory mediation was rejected almost totally by the witnesses and by comments in the vast bulk of evidence that was submitted to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal that the member for Bennelong raised and that the Liberal Party would introduce in government effectively imposes compulsory mediation. This reflects the committee's minority report, which was initiated by the shadow minister for social security, who was a member of the committee, and signed by all opposition members of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These opposition members put forward the proposal that mediation and adjudication should be available when serious allegations of physical or sexual abuse are made. They also incorporated in their report the suggestion that a form of appeal should be available&mdash;that is, the payment should be subject to appeal by the parents. In effect, the abusers could appeal against the person abused being supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that most young Australians and their families do not have major problems. Most grow up, become independent and become parents themselves without a hiccup or a concern. But it is also a fact that tens of thousands of young Australians are abused every year. In 1992-93, there were more than 22,000 substantiated cases of abuse or neglect against young Australians, and that number is increasing annually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might like to ignore that or pretend that it is not happening, but the fact is that it is happening. The opposition is now putting forward a proposal which blames the victims for the problems, implies that the veracity of the young people making the allegations should be questioned and says that they need to agree to be mediated. This is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people whom the member for Bennelong spoke to last week at the ACOSS conference will understand that. The broader community may see the proposal as being attractive&mdash;it sounds like a great idea; `mediation' is a wonderful word&mdash;but when young men or women have been physically or sexually abused and are then told, `You will need to have mediation sessions,' they will not apply for financial support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those young people will turn to other means of income, and we heard that during the inquiry. Crime and prostitution are the alternatives that young Australians have chosen in the past and they will choose them in the future if we deny them support. The proposal put forward last week sounded benign and, on the face of it, plausible. In reality, it is a vicious, regressive move which should be condemned by all of us in this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Sunday, 8 October 1995 a friend of mine and no doubt of all who knew him, Mr Dudley Belling, passed away. Dudley was a long-time resident of Illabo, a small town close to Junee, Dirnaseer and Bethungra, and was well known and highly regarded by everyone in the district who had any contact with him&mdash;and this would have been nearly everyone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dudley was married to Mary and together they raised a large family&mdash;no doubt often finding it a struggle, but certainly the Belling family was never short of love and caring. Dudley was firstly a great Christian gentleman who set high moral standards for himself and therefore expected the same from those around him. He was always working for someone in the community, whether it be someone from the Illabo Show Society, the Catholic Church, the National Party, the Illabo Country and Western Stampede or, indeed, anyone who asked for his help. Anyone who required his help was never refused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dudley Belling's funeral service, and requiem mass said by Father Fitzgerald, was held in the small Illabo Catholic Church, which is reminiscent of many of those small Catholic churches built by the early Irish pioneers in many parts of Australia, and particularly in the Riverina. When I first saw it, I was reminded of Father Hartigan, who went under the nom de plume of John O'Brien and was author of the poems in the famous publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Around the Boree Log</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It did not surprise me to see that most of the 300-strong mourners were standing outside the church, which could not contain all those who came to mourn the passing of their friend Dudley. As we stood in the churchyard on that beautiful Riverina spring day, the grass was green and the grain crops in the distance were thriving. There were a few sprinkles from light clouds as they passed over an otherwise blue sky, and the sound of the birds singing in the nearby trees made me think of Dudley's great love for the beautiful country that he was part of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dudley's greatest love was for his family, and I know how proud he was of their achievements. He also loved his community.

For those of us who are fortunate, at some time in our lives&mdash;perhaps even more than once&mdash;we meet a person with whom we have an immediate affinity and whom we quickly grow to love and admire. This is how I felt about Dudley Belling, and I am sure that I was one of many who felt this way about him. On behalf of my wife, Annie, and my staff, I offer my condolences to Mary and her family and pray that they have the courage to overcome their present grief and to face the future, receiving all of those blessings that Dudley would have wished for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) sometimes blunders into speaking the truth. So, when on ABC radio this morning he said that the industrial strife in Western Australia was a product of politics, he was dead right. He was right because his colleagues in Western Australia in the Court-Kierath government set out from day one to politicise industrial relations in that state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Confrontation, not consensus, is the first commandment of the Court-Kierath government. Linked with that first commandment is their law: `Thou shalt not have any trade unions before me.' Like a cockatoo screeching his few words again and again, John Howard keeps telling us that Labor is running a scare campaign against the coalition's industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us listen to the words of his Western Australian colleague Graham Kierath when he was arguing the case for abolishing the award system in that state and getting rid of the safety net. These are his words, not the Labor Party's words. They are his own words exactly. On ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> on 23 August, Mr Kierath said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Areas of the labour market that were over-priced and needed to be re-adjusted, what we would call low-skilled, low-paid starter jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the agenda in Western Australia&mdash;to cut wages for the low skilled and the low paid. There is no sentiment in that statement for battlers, just cold words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then look at Mr Kierath's own action on 26 September when he rejected a recommendation of the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission that the weekly minimum wage should be increased by $24.30. He cut that figure back by a third to $16, making a minimum wage in that state of $317.10. In Victoria recently, Mr Kennett put forward a minimum wage of $8.60 per hour without provision for loadings, penalty rates or skill increments. That was a cut of $60 a week for a minimum wage worker in that state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party did not invent Graham Kierath or Jeff Kennett as part of a scare campaign. Mr Kierath is the Liberal Party, the Liberal Party in government. No Labor politician made up those words about cutting the wages of the low skilled. They are all his own words. No Labor scare campaign invented his action in slashing the arbitrator's recommendation for minimum wage earners. The Western Australian government is contemptuous of low wage earners. Its first round of industrial relations legislation abolished overtime pay and penalty rates and did not allow for a no disadvantage test. It was clearly an agenda to cut wages for low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manufactured crisis in industrial relations in Western Australia is about politics. Mr Howard was absolutely right about that; the politics of the hard, bully-boy, standover, right wing who want to slash wages and who so dominate the Liberal and National parties in this House and throughout the Australian states. Court and his hatchet man Kierath had one simple objective: to destroy the right of people to organise collectively to negotiate. When they achieve that, all low paid workers can be picked off one by one. Kicking low wage earners is what Mr Howard's cheer squad of fellow Liberals want to hear, and certainly what they in this House want to hear. That is the politics of fanatics. It is as fanatic, and more fanatic, than any old-fashioned Stalinist class warfare believer would say or do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the world celebrated the 50th anniversary of the publication of George Orwell's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Animal Farm</EMPHASIS>, the brilliant satire on the abuse of power by Stalin, which was just as much a satire on the abuse of words by politicians like John Howard. Orwell, were he living today, would recognise and relish the cynical abuse of words by the coalition in the discussions about industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take Kierath's use of the word `readjustment' when he refers to what is a cut and slash policy for low wage earners. The word `readjustment' is neutral. Mr Kierath makes it all sound like adjusting the focus on a TV screen. But the truth is that those wage earners are human beings with families, and readjustment, in the Liberal Party's parlance, means taking money out of the mouths of working families. Orwell would have appreciated the sheer, blatant cheek of the way in which John Howard repeats the word `reform' again and again, like zealots chant slogans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plain meaning of the word `reform' in the history of Western democracies has been change for the better&mdash;progress, whether it is for more voting rights, welfare for the aged and needy, justice for all or, more importantly, the right of people to organise. But when John Howard uses the word `reform', he does not mean progress; he means turning the clock back. In Mr Howard's good old days, nurses were not paid overtime. In Mr Howard's good old days, when school leavers presented themselves at their first job in a shop there was no nonsense about restrictions on hours and no trade union officials around to raise inconvenient questions. All they had was the right to negotiate the privilege of sleeping under the counter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back a bit further in Mr Howard's golden days, governments had not yet intervened against child labour. So the logic of the Liberal position is simply to remove conditions and to go back to those bad old days. The logic of this means that, under John Howard's industrial relations policy, the teenager fresh from school would have an individual contract shoved under his or her nose with no nonsense about overtime. Mr Howard would pine for the day when trainee nurses were not even paid. John Howard camouflages his true policy by invoking the language of freedom of choice. He clearly has a policy to slash wages for workers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

We have to change the law, Mr Speaker. Right now you and I cannot erect a flagpole in our own backyards without getting council permission first, yet these telecommunications carriers can put up a 30-metre-high tower virtually where they want. It is not right. It is absolutely scandalous and the law must be changed. But we have got to change policy as well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, Optus cannot use Telstra's network because it does not trust Telstra, its competitor&mdash;for understandable reasons&mdash;to charge it a fair price. Nor can Optus dig its own cables, because it has got to compete, in that instance, with Telstra, which has got the cables underground already, courtesy of the Australian taxpayer. So it is government policy which means that what we are likely to end up with is the worst environmental option as well as the worst commercial option, because the only option that this government gives Optus is its cheap and nasty roll-out of pay TV cable on power poles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government's rules we are going to get a $4 billion duplication of telecommunications infrastructure. That is $4 billion which is going to be factored into the price that Optus charges consumers. That is $4 billion that Telstra could charge people over and above its prices because of the margin that Optus has to pay. In other words, $8 billion extra is what consumers in Australia could face, thanks to this government's telecommunications policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Duplication of telecommunications infrastructure makes no more sense than duplication of any other infrastructure. It is about as sensible as building two expressways from Sydney to Melbourne instead of just one. It is about as sensible as having two railway networks instead of just one. In other words, it makes no sense whatsoever, yet this is what we are saddled with, or likely to be saddled with, thanks to this government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solution is for the government, which owns Telstra, to direct Telstra to make its cable and conduits available to everyone, to all comers&mdash;to everyone who wants to use the telecommunications infrastructure. At the end of the day, that infrastructure is not owned by Telstra; it is owned by the Australian taxpayer, and it should be used in ways which benefit the Australian taxpayer and which do not just allow Telstra to pay its executives outrageous salaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps we need to go further than that. Perhaps we need to break up Telstra. Perhaps we need to break it up into its service providing component and its infrastructure providing component.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telstra, at the moment, is like the old Soviet Union&mdash;it is too big to provide decent customer service and at the same time it is too big to be a fair competitor.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had a lot of discussion already today about industrial relations, particularly industrial relations in Western Australia where today there was a blockade which, I understand, was very successful. I watched with interest on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> the Premier of Western Australia talking about the blockade and saying how outrageous it was. He said, `It was only about secret ballots after all and I would not have thought that was a draconian measure.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from the fact that the proposal to have secret ballots for any industrial action is totally unworkable and unprecedented in this country, and pretty outrageous at that, if these proposed secret ballots were ever to go ahead, there would be a warning on the ballot paper saying something like, `If you take industrial action you could be breaking the law or breaching your contract.' That is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can just imagine the analogies you could make with that. Why doesn't this parliament pass a bill that says that the Australian Electoral Commission at the next federal election should put on the ballot paper, `If you vote for the coalition you could be inviting industrial mayhem.' What would people think of that? It is obviously pretty outrageous but no more outrageous than what the Western Australian government is trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the Western Australian government of old. I lived in Perth in the 1970s when the now premier's father was the premier. The government now, as then, hates Aboriginal people and hates workers just as much. These draconian attacks will not work at the ballot box. I do not know what they are trying to prove. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the last five federal elections the federal coalition has tried to make industrial relations an issue. At the last election in particular, as I remember very well, although the GST and Medicare were issues, industrial relations was certainly a big issue, focused in the minds of the voters as the main difference between the two parties. I must admit that there are times when a lot of people, including myself, wonder about what differences there are between the parties on some issues. But with industrial relations, most of the time there are still pretty clear differences&mdash;differences which are shown in the various pieces of legislation put forward by state governments around the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had the New South Wales industrial relations legislation of the Fahey government&mdash;I will come back to Mr Fahey in a minute&mdash;which has been repealed by the new state government. We have Kennett's industrial relations mayhem in Victoria. Now we have this absolutely ridiculous situation in Western Australia. The coalition will never learn. They still think there are votes in union bashing. It is a wonder they do not drag out commie bashing as well and talk about reds under the beds. At the moment, it is unionists under the bed in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition today condemned the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) because her electorate staff&mdash;who, presumably, are members of a union, probably the CPSU, my old union&mdash;actually exercised their democratic right to take industrial action in Western Australia by taking part in the blockade. That blockade was organised by the trade union movement in Western Australia and was supported by the community at large as a quite understandable protest against the outrageously draconian industrial relations legislation proposed in that state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the coalition will never learn. People talk about the polls. They talk about how we will be thrashed at the next election and that the coalition is a shoe-in. They are saying in my electorate that, because they have chosen John Fahey as a candidate for Macarthur, it is all over, red rover. People are saying to me, `Aren't you glad you are not the candidate any more because it is all over?' I do not concede that but I agree that the candidate that has been chosen is probably a better candidate than the previous one. Nevertheless, he was the industrial relations minister and then premier in New South Wales in a failed Liberal government, so people will probably remember that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the coalition never seems to learn about these divisive issues. We have a very nasty, divisive premier and divisive government in Western Australia. Equally, at the next federal election you will see these industrial relations policies rolled out and, if we ever do hear any of the other policies that the coalition has on other issues, you can be sure that if they are telling the truth they will be just as nasty and draconian as they were in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the election is held, possibly around March next year, I believe that the people will vote the same way as they did in 1993. Forget about the polls at the moment. People will not be fooled. If the coalition is silly enough to make industrial relations an election issue, it will be on the heads of those opposite. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The violence and arrests in East Timor over the last week or two have once again drawn our attention to the violations of human rights that have occurred in that country. It is an uncomfortable subject for many Australians because of the fact that the dictates of realpolitik clash with what we like to see as our basic human values. We certainly feel a sense of hopelessness about our inability to influence events in East Timor&mdash;not only through the current government but through the Fraser government and the Whitlam government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my own constituents, a minister of the Church of Christ, visited East Timor last year. He wrote me a lengthy letter on what he saw in that country. He said the following on his impressions of Dili:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My surface view of East Timor was of a very obvious and oppressive military presence, and of quiet but fearful people. Walking around the town for an hour or two after we first arrived my wife and I saw a number of trucks loaded with armed soldiers. Numerous military posts are sited throughout the town, its suburbs and outlying villages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our third day in Dili happened to be the anniversary of the integration of East Timor into Indonesia, and this was proclaimed by temporary monuments on many of the town's streets. The day before, we talked with a young man on the street in a country town. He said, `Tomorrow is the anniversary of the integration.' I said, `Is that a good thing or a bad thing?' He lowered his voice, even though no one else was in sight, and said, `Some people are against it.' I probed just a little further, `Are more people for it or more people against it?' Embarrassed, he hesitated before he said, `I have not counted them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We attended a 6:00 am mass at Bishop Belo's residence. Fifteen hundred people stood for the hour and a quarter service. Just before the conclusion of the service the Bishop gave a brief `pep talk' to the congregation asking that there be no demonstrations at the integration ceremonies, or if there were that there be no violence and no flag tearing. He had been pressured to do this . . . by the military commandant, who visited on two successive evenings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Military observers occupy a house opposite the Bishop's residence and watch everyone who comes and goes from the residence. The Bishop runs a very fine line as he seeks to stand up for his people and also retain his ability to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told that all the rooms in our hotel were bugged. Later, as we talked in hushed tones over dinner with another couple of Australians, I mentioned the room bugging. One of the others said, `We know. I am an electronic engineer. I have already found one in our room.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were approached on the street by several young people, keen to practice their English and to be friendly to some Australians. One said, `Why does not Australia support our independence?' Another said forcefully, `I do not like the Indonesians.' Yet another young person complained that he could not get a job because of the preference given to the Indonesians who were being introduced to East Timor. It seemed that, with the strength of the transmigration program, if and when Indonesia graciously decided to allow an act of self-determination for East Timor the majority of people may be Indonesians anyway.</PARA>
<PARA>Last week, security forces arrested over 120 youths during four days of unrest in Dili. The incident left at least two people dead and many injured. This morning, local sources say that 50 more pro-independence young people were arrested after a Catholic school they were sheltering in was stormed by firing Indonesian troops who wounded several youths and, after rounding them up, beat them in front of the nuns before marching them away to waiting trucks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week's violence was said to have been sparked by a dispute between members of East Timor's majority Catholic population and a Muslim Indonesian official. Bishop Belo, the head of the local Catholic church, was shortlisted recently for the Nobel Peace Prize. After clashes last year, he wrote to President Suharto expressing concern over alleged human rights violations. Bishop Belo declared that the church was ready to cooperate with the government and armed forces in keeping peace in Timor, but he made it clear that the military should respect human dignity and local culture. We can only hope that Bishop Belo's message will spread. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been encouraged by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) to come into the chamber and participate in the adjournment debate. Mr Speaker, you would remember that it was a common feature in the old days in the Old Parliament House precincts that remarks by members on both sides of the House would often encourage ministers to come down and participate in the adjournment debate. This is the second time that I have had to come down and explain to the honourable member for Warringah two fundamental mistakes that he has made in his understanding of communications policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first problem that he has is that he does not yet understand that you need duplication, or the threat of it, for competition. We had this debate in Australia in the 1940s. It was actually my party that suggested that you got the best banking system by nationalising the banks and having one bank run every bank in Australia. We lost, I think, the 1949 election and no Labor government since has ever tried to head down that path&mdash;quite rightly, because we have realised you need more than one bank to have the competition on prices and services and to give people a choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the honourable member for Warringah mentioned Coles Myer. We do not say that Coles Myer is the only company in Australia that is allowed to set up supermarkets because that saves on infrastructure. That is the logical extension of your argument, that we should have only one&mdash;probably government owned&mdash;store that would be the only place where we could go along and buy our groceries. Using your argument, that is the most cost efficient way that you could minimise the investment in supermarket construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our party has argued since 1949 that competition is something that is healthy for consumers. It is much better to have investors deciding whether it is in the best interests of consumers to have a Coles and a Woolworths in the same town. You certainly do not have the government drawing lines on maps and saying that certain towns are reserved for Coles supermarkets and others are reserved for Woolworths supermarkets. That is really what the honourable member is arguing&mdash;that I should sit here with a map of Australia on the desk and work out which parts of the country are reserved for Telstra, for Telecom, to cable up and which half of the country is reserved for Optus Vision to cable up. It is the very threat of competition that ensures people are kept on their toes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member says that he does not want duplication of the cable investment because that is like having two freeways or two roads or two of any other type of infrastructure. As I tried to explain to him once before, we would not have competition between Optus and Telecom for long distance calls, for STD calls, if Optus had not duplicated the fibre optic links between all the capital cities. The reason we have cheaper phone calls from Sydney to Melbourne today is that Optus duplicated Telcom's infrastructure, Telecom's cables, from Sydney to Melbourne. That has provided great discounts for consumers&mdash;for business and residential consumers. Prices are down by about $380 million a year. We have had a massive increase in investment in upgrading Australia's communications infrastructure. Exports of telecommunications equipment have gone from $200 million to almost $1 billion a year. People now have a wider choice of services and Telecom's customer services have improved dramatically. All of those things have only occurred since the Labor government introduced competition in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I make to the honourable member is that at that time this parliament agreed to let Optus have access to Telecom's conduits. You do not seem to understand that the current Telecommunications Act does give Optus access to Telecom's conduits. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Abbott" NAMEID="EZ5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EZ5">Mr Abbott</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It's not at a fair price.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You say, `It's not at a fair price.' You were arguing during your speech that somehow or other we should make the conduits and the cable available. That is what the current Telecommunications Act says: that Optus is allowed to get access to those cables. For most of the calls that are made by people in the gallery who might use Optus, they use some of Telecom's cable and some of Optus's cable. Optus has to pay for the use of the elements of Telecom's cable; Optus is required to pay what they call the interconnect price. That interconnect price was initially set by the minister of the day, Kim Beazley, and it is something which has been set impartially with the help of Austel as an independent arbitrator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people argue that it was set too low to give an advantage to Optus. Optus would argue that they think it is set high enough. Certainly the playing field was tilted in favour of Optus; it was tilted in favour of rolling out this infrastructure, rolling out this duplication, so that we get competition on price. That is why we tried to ensure that there was the ability for Optus to use Telstra's cable and vice versa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, as the government has announced its plans for the post-1997 rules for competition in telecommunications, we have said again that if any telephone company which is a carrier&mdash;whether it is Telstra, Optus or British Telecom&mdash;invests money in cable or if another company comes to Australia and invests money in cable they have to let other people have access to their cable. It is going to be one of the most open and competitive regimes anywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The choice between letting the market forces decide where telephone companies invest in cable is to have Comrade Abbott sitting up there preparing the five-year plan, telling Telstra and Optus and everyone else where they can invest in cable. I bet he would have a lot of the money spent in Warringah, too, because he knows that, if you get that duplication of the infrastructure, you get that competition for the lower prices for business and residential consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can just see Comrade Abbott or Comrade Alston, the shadow spokesman for communications, calling in Frank Blount, Bob Mansfield or Brian Inglis and pinning on them the `Howard Star' for meeting their five-year plan targets in investing in cable. It is just a return to the Soviet central planning model, Mr Speaker. You know there are a few people around this building who might still subscribe to that view, but I am staggered to know that the member for Warringah is one of the people who subscribes to the view that central planning and monopoly businesses are the only way that you can save on the costs of infrastructure investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also a little bit disappointed that he has not yet informed his constituents&mdash;all the members of the gallery who are here tonight&mdash;that it was his party which helped to vote to ensure that the telephone companies were exempted from the state planning laws&mdash;I think you were advising a minister around the place at the time&mdash;because it was a vote of both the government and the opposition that ensured that the exemption that the telephone companies now enjoy was not overturned on a resolution from some other people. It is, in fact, those areas that will get the duplication in the pay TV cable that will be getting the benefits that flow from the use of that cable. So, if you happen to be someone who wants to subscribe to Optus and get the lowest priced phone calls from Optus, you will probably want that Optus cable in your street. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, if the honourable member for Warringah wants to write to Geoffrey Cousins at Optus Vision or to the general manager at Optus and say that he does not want his electorate to have any of this overhead cable, they might oblige you, but I do not know if your constituents would be happy if they missed out on the lower prices that flow, especially for local calls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I challenge the honourable member for Warringah to write a letter to Geoffrey Cousins saying that he does not want his constituents to have cable in their streets, that he does not want his constituents to benefit from the local calls that go. That is the real test. He is always in here complaining about the mobile telephone towers, but he has not yet surrendered his mobile phone. I have challenged him to do that too, Mr Speaker&mdash;to surrender to you in a public ceremony his mobile telephone so that he can prove to us that he is not encouraging the use of this electromagnetic radiation that he finds so objectionable. </PARA>

The final point I make is that we have toughened the environmental regime on the telephone carriers. Now if they want to build a mobile phone tower and the local council objects, it does not just plough straight ahead. What happens now is that CEPA, the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, ends up being the umpire if there is a proposal that the local council does not agree with. It is through these issues that we have tried to strike the right balance, in encouraging investment in infrastructure and empowering local councils to have a chance to influence the decisions that the carriers make.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following a general election letters and reminders are sent seeking information as to why a name was marked off a certified list more than once.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Replies often provide information which when compared with information provided by other electors in response to non-voters notices, reveal </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">cases of polling official error. Such errors are generally where the name of the wrong elector is marked on the certified list, resulting in that elector having his/her name marked twice, and no mark appearing against the name of the other elector. In such cases a multiple vote would not be recorded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, where an elector replies that he/she only voted once, this must be accepted in the absence of other conclusive evidence to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other replies indicate evidence which is inconclusive, that is where the elector does not reply to correspondence or letters are returned unclaimed. In these cases there is no evidence of a multiple vote, simply a multiple mark, that cannot be further investigated. There are also other replies where the elector admitted to voting more than once. The figures for each of these categories for the 1993 general election follow. Note that the figures represent cases of voters being marked off the certified list twice, except for one case in the Division of Braddon, where a voter admitted voting 4 times.</PARA>
