<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday  the  honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) asked me a question relating to the procedure adopted by the chair pursuant to standing orders 303 and 304A, and their application with respect to his naming and that of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Standing order 303 refers to disorder by a member and, for a variety of offences, concludes `the member may be named by the Speaker'. It does not say the Speaker has to warn a member about his or her behaviour. However, it has become general practice for the chair to call a member to order and sometimes warn a member. For reference, page 502 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> clearly indicates that. Standing order 304A was introduced in 1994 and provides the chair with the option of requiring a member to withdraw from the House for a period of one hour. Clearly, the chair may exercise discretion in the application of the provisions of these standing orders, and that will continue to be the practice whilst I occupy this position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the naming and subsequent suspension of the honourable member for Fisher, standing order 303 was applied as he interjected when the chair was issuing a general warning about the flagrant disregard for the standing orders being displayed within the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the honourable member for Gippsland, as recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, he had been rebuked on several occasions for interjecting and had been given a formal warning. In fact he was rebuked for reflecting on the chair. Notwithstanding the statement by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) that the honourable member for Gippsland had not interjected on that occasion, before the chair could respond to that explanation, the honourable member for Gippsland expressed insolence towards the chair. I would refer honourable members to page 502 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the offences for which a Member may be named are set out in standing order 303, it is not uncommon for a Member to be named for an offence which is not specifically stated in the terms of the standing order but which is considered to be encompassed within its purview. For example, in regard to conduct towards the Chair, Members have been named for imputing motives to, disobedience to, defying, disregarding the authority of, reflecting upon, insolence to, and using expressions insulting or offensive to, the Chair.</PARA>
<PARA>It was for that reason the provisions of standing order 303 were applied.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I present the report of the Commonwealth of Australia Branch Delegation to the 40th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference held in Banff, Canada, in October 1994. In making a short statement in connection with that report, I note those people from the Senate and the House of Representatives who attended this conference on behalf of this parliament. The delegation was led by the President of the Senate, the Hon. Michael Beahan; me, as deputy leader; Senator Margaret Reynolds; the Hon. Bruce Reid; and Mr Barry Cunningham. In addition, there was Mr Richard Coventry, who was the secretary to the delegation, and Mr Derek Abbott, who was adviser to the President. Also in attendance from this parliament were Mr Ted Grace, who is the representative to the executive of the CPA for our region, and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, Mr Lyn Barlin, who was in attendance at the conference and also attended the clerks at the table component of the CPA conference held in Banff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group was very well led by the President of the Senate, the Hon. Michael Beahan. He led a group of people who were very harmonious. I do not think there was a difficult moment throughout the time that we were in Banff. It is a credit to all those people who were a part of that delegation that we were able to work so well together during the time we travelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Richard Coventry, who came from the parliament to assist us in this task. He is a very professional person, someone who carries out his work in an unbiased and professional fashion, as well as a very pleasant person to spend a great deal of time with. I thank Derek Abbott, who works for the President of the Senate, who also came along and was of great assistance to us. In nearly all cases, spouses joined the members of the delegation and it was a very harmonious group. Also, the Canadians, our hosts on this occasion, were very good hosts. We were well and truly looked after. Nothing was at fault in terms of the organisation, accommodation and delivery of services to the conference. Our hosts on that occasion deserve commendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take this opportunity to thank the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which assisted us with background information in preparation for this trip. That information assisted us in being represented at all of the panel discussions that were held throughout the conference, and I indeed think the parliament would be quite proud of the contributions made by all of the members of the delegation in the discussions that took place. I thought our delegation stood out from the rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the general view of everybody who attended from our delegation that, whilst the CPA conference is a great opportunity for members of this parliament to meet leading figures from throughout the Commonwealth, be they at the national or state level that they represent, this is a terribly valuable opportunity for us. We really need to go further in reforms of the CPA, and I know that there have been reforms undertaken of the CPA over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the general view of members of the delegation that, to give the CPA conference&mdash;such as the one we attended last year&mdash;more meaning, it is necessary for us to carry resolutions at the conference. Currently, no resolutions are carried. Therefore, one cannot make a statement that indicates the widespread support of people who attend the conference. It was the view of delegates that we need to carry resolutions at the conference and that a report needs to be given to the following conference. As it stands at the present time, the discussion held at the conference is nothing more than discussion and, whilst it is possible to say what the views of people who spoke were, it is not possible to say what the majority of those at the conference felt, and the discussion tends to run into the sand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we would like to see going from our delegation to our regional representative&mdash;in this instance, the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace)&mdash;recommendations to see the conference carry resolutions and to see those resolutions followed through for the next conference. This is so the conference and the debate that takes place at the conference can be given more meaning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, overall, it was a very worthwhile exercise. It was very well organised at the Australian level and at the Commonwealth and Canadian levels. It provided an opportunity for members of this House to hear views and concerns of leading citizens from throughout the world, and to pass on experiences we have acquired in Australia to other members of the Commonwealth. It was a very valuable exercise indeed, but one which could be made even more valuable if we were able to carry through those resolutions with some follow-up action for the next conference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I had the honour and privilege of taking the place of my good friend and colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) on the delegation to Canada. I wish to support the remarks made by the deputy leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp). I will also add comments regarding the role of the leader of the delegation, the President of the Senate, Senator Beahan, and the role he played in making sure that the delegation carried out its functions on behalf of the Australian parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague said, it was a most harmonious group. We cooperated and worked very well together. All members spoke on a number of issues. I had the privilege and honour of speaking on two panel sessions, and I enjoyed participating in those sessions. I think that the Australian input into those panel discussions was particularly well received and I think we gained quite an amount from the contribution made by other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I also pay tribute to Mr Richard Coventry, the secretary of the delegation, and Mr Derek Abbott, the adviser to the President. We were fortunate to have in attendance with us the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace), who attended the conference in his capacity as the regional representative, and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, Mr Lyn Barlin, who guided us through the conference. I compliment them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The setting for the conference was quite magnificent. The historic Banff Springs Hotel in the province of Alberta needs to be seen to be truly believed. It is in a magnificent setting. Certainly one of the highlights of the conference was that all sessions and functions were able to be held in the one facility. That really made for a very harmonious group of all nations. We had the opportunity to mix freely with delegates from other nations and to swap ideas. It was an excellent setting for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to particularly mention the welcoming speech by Chief Ernest Wesley, the chief of the Wesley First Nations and a member of the Stoney Nations. It was quite magnificent. Certainly the audience and all of the delegates were moved by the manner in which he welcomed people to the province of Alberta, and particularly to Banff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also would just mention the recommendations brought forward by the report. I support the remarks made by the honourable member for Hume in this matter because it was the united view of the delegates, upon completion of the conference, that further action needed to be taken with any resolutions which that conference arrived at. I do support the remarks of John Sharp in that regard. I think there is a view that the proceedings might be strengthened and that some of those recommendations should be carried through to the next conference. Once again, I thank everyone who participated in that delegation for making the visit such a success. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to join in the debate on the Anzac Day Bill. Anzac Day clearly means more to people than any other day of remembrance in Australia. For many veterans and servicemen it is the beginning of a military tradition of mateship, of standing united in the face of adversity. For most Australians our nationhood was defined on the beaches of Gallipoli&mdash;and that is not to take away from the very great contribution of the New Zealanders in that battle. I suppose that there are many ways in which we celebrate Anzac Day. Importantly, in New South Wales, on that day, there is the tradition of two-up being legal&mdash;a game which is another fine tradition having come from the battlefields of World War I.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the values that people ascribe to Anzac Day are made up of much more than parades, two-up games and the fraternity of service men and women on that day. The values which were so easily distinguished on the beaches of Gallipoli&mdash;mateship and a steadfast belief in what we call `a fair go'&mdash;are today a very significant part of our national and cultural identity. It has been that immovable set of values which has defined the way we see ourselves and distinguished the face of Australia and Australians overseas. Although the rallying call in World War I might have been for the mother country, I think there was an exuberance among young Australians about going off to war. There was also the view that this was fighting for the rights of others to have a fair go, fighting to see that people had the freedom that they enjoyed in this country. Australia and New Zealand did not go to war simply to assist Britain. The diggers went to battle with the feeling that they were representing a new country which was taking its place in the world&mdash;which Australia and New Zealand were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about Anzac Day I think it is always important for us to remember that this is a tradition that we share with our colleagues across the Tasman. The very name, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, says it all. The importance we place on this event as a nation takes nothing away from the contribution of the New Zealanders. Anzac Day recognises our place in the region and the historic links we have with New Zealand. After all, it could have been called, for instance, `Gallipoli Day' if people had seen it as something that only had to do with that particular facet of the Second World War. As a young nation it is important for us to remember and learn from the past so that we can look forward confidently to the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone has a sense of their roots and of where their family came from; to the same extent, countries are shaped by those things as well. Gallipoli&mdash;with the valour, the loyalty and the sacrifice made for mates&mdash;will forever shape the way Australians see themselves and the rest of the world. That is why I am very proud each year, as no doubt are all other members, when I see the many dedicated local men and women of RSL clubs working in schools to ensure that those values, which are today referred to as the spirit of Anzac, are kept alive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Earlwood Bardwell Park RSL in my electorate runs a primary school program to ensure that the historic details of the battle&mdash;the number of men who died or survived, the suffering and sacrifice in service and on the home front&mdash;the values and the human spirit are not just remembered but also understood by young people. Anzac Day is not just about a battle of many years ago. It is not necessarily about war and valour; it is about those matters of spirit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am also very proud of the active role the RSL clubs, Legacy, the War Widows Association and many other local organisations in my electorate have taken in the Australia Remembers program. That program commemorates the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. Again, the focus of the Watson Australia Remembers committee is to ensure that our children understand the conflict and sacrifice of the Second World War. That will therefore ensure a lasting commemoration of the sacrifice and hardships endured by our forefathers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the projects that the Watson committee plans to undertake include an oral history program&mdash;to detail the contributions of our local heroes&mdash;and a special edition newspaper focusing on local people's experiences at home and overseas.

I cannot think of any better way than ensuring that Anzac Day will always remain a national day of commemoration.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Anzacs at the Gallipoli landing on 25 April, 1915, were instrumental in forging a new identity for Australia. The landing was a lifetime ago, but the deeds of those ANZACS of 1915-18, still speak a message of selfless service and sacrifice that will last forever.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important for Australians to remember the vast number of young men, in the main, who fell or were wounded in that war. It was probably a war that touched every home in this country. Even though there were more casualties in the Second World War, the fighting in the First World War was probably far more vicious than any fighting in modern time. Right across the winners and the losers, a generation of young people was nearly wiped out. </PARA>

I went through a brief resume of the history of Australia starting from 1788. It was recorded that, on the day that Captain Arthur Phillip sailed from Botany Bay into Sydney Cove, two French ships came around the heads under the command of Captain La Perouse. What a difference it would have been if La Perouse had been there a bit earlier; perhaps this speech would have been in French, and we may have been a French colony with all the resultant effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imagine what Captain Arthur Phillip felt when he knew that his marines did not have proper supplies, reserves of ammunition or anything else. He was responsible for this new colony of New Holland. Time went by and I suppose that defence was on the minds of not only Captain Arthur Phillip but the people who came after him. Before we became a nation, we had the colonies and, apart from their defences, different regiments were formed under the patronage of wealthy citizens. </PARA>

I believe that Sir Rupert Clarke financed his own regiment. This cannon, which is now very well housed at the Deniliquin RSL, is an artefact of those times. I recommend that anyone passing through Deniliquin should stop and have a look at this cannon which belonged to one of these private regiments in Victoria. </PARA>

In the main, Australians were represented as colonists at those various wars. As the member for Watson and other speakers have said before, it was not until those Australians from a new nation struggled ashore at Gallipoli that Australia was brought to the recognition of the rest of the world. I believe that it was on that day that Australia really became a nation. </PARA>

All the attributes that they developed over that short period were displayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Masefield describes those people as `the finest body of young men ever brought together in modern times'.

Some people refer to it as the most successful failure in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the withdrawal the Anzacs went on to fight and suffer enormous losses in many other theatres of war.

At Gallipoli we lost 7,600 young Australians. Our troops went from Gallipoli to places such as the Somme where 23,000 died, Ypres where 38,000 died and Bullecourt where 10,000 died. This is not to mention our losses at Pozieres, Villers-Bretonneux and on the Hindenburg line, and at places with other famous names in Australian history&mdash;Sinai, Palestine and, of course, the famous Australian light horse charge at Beersheba, the last great calvary charge in history.

She said, `I could not work out why my mother was worried. I thought, "Last time we got a telegram my favourite aunty was coming to visit. Why would mother be worried about this?"

Run down to the next paddock and see your brother and get him to unhitch the horses." So I ran down to the next paddock and, when I told my brother the story, he started to cry because he had lost, he believed, two of his brothers. He unhitched the horses, jumped on one of them and rode back to the homestead. He hitched up the sulky and drove the 10 miles into the railway station'&mdash;the train line had only come through about five years before&mdash;`and got to Lithgow to find that his aunt had died a day before.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell you this story to set the framework of the time and the period that we are talking about. There was very little communication.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to commend to the House the history department of the Australian Defence Force Academy. If you have a family member or someone you would like to know about from the First World War, for a small fee it will send out to you information on things like regimental number, place of birth, occupation, where the person was enrolled, what they enrolled as and what happened to them. For example, in relation to one of the gentlemen I mentioned, it says `Fate&mdash;killed in action 9 October 1917; Place of Death or Wounding&mdash;Passchendaele, Belgium,' and&mdash;the very sad part&mdash;`Place of Burial&mdash;no known grave'. This is the information that a lot of the families and people who remained in Australia received. For anyone who would like that information, it is a matter of contacting the Australian Defence Force Academy. I commend the academy on its endeavours in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we move on to the Second World War. A million people enlisted. In this war there were more people involved in the navy and the air force and a lot more women involved. We mention names like Kokoda, El Alamein, Greece, Rabaul, Sanananda, Balikpapan, Milne Bay, Syria and the Battle of Britain. In those wars the same traditions applied as the Anzacs fought the Axis powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To highlight that point, I mention that over 40 years ago&mdash;between April and late October 1941&mdash;brigades of the 9th Division of the Second Australian Imperial Force, along with allied troops, held Tobruk in one of the most memorable feats of arms accomplished by Australia's fighting men. Legend has it that the Axis powers tagged them `the Rats of Tobruk'&mdash;a name that they still wear with pride. From 8 April to 25 October, casualties amounted to 749 killed, 199 wounded, with 604 prisoners taken by the Axis powers. I quote a passage from the Official War History volume on Tobruk and El Alamein written by Bart Maughan. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if the most dreadful burden borne by the defenders was the constant manning of shallow and sun-scorched diggings and weapon-pits in the regularly bombed bullet-raked Salient, in which to stand in daylight was to stand for the last time; these judgments only illustrate that each man had his own job in the conduct of the defence. The spontaneous respect of all arms and services for the performance of the others and loyalty with which they combined were the things that made Tobruk strong in defence and dangerous to its besiegers . . .</PARA>
<PARA>We see from that statement that the Australians of Tobruk and other places of the Second World War were no different in their courage from those who served in the First World War. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. We must not forget in those remembrance ceremonies those people who were prisoners of war and who suffered tremendous deprivation by being prisoners. Many, of course, did not return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then move on to the battlefields of Korea. At Kapyong, Australians won the American Presidential Citation. Very few people know of the battleground at Maryang San in Korea. But I have heard the efforts of Australian soldiers at the battle of Maryang San were described as one of the greatest feats of any armed force at any time. We then move to the Malayan emergency and Vietnam and names like Long Tan and Binh Ba, and now to the efforts of our peacekeeping forces. We can hold our heads high wherever Australian service men and women have been involved in showing the courage that was first shown on 25 April 1915. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever I have the good fortune to travel overseas I, like many other Australians, find that one of the reasons we can hold our heads high overseas is these traditions that have been laid down by the Anzacs and by those men and women who came after them. As an Australian, I am very proud of those efforts and it is another reason why 25 April is a very important day to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why the member for Melbourne Ports brought his bill before the parliament was the need to educate our young people about the traditions of Australia. Politically, we talk about what may have happened in the recent past. We hear the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) talk about what happened in 1983&mdash;how terrible the coalition was and things like that. I have to tell the Prime Minister that most young people do not even think back to 1983. They are concerned about the present and the future. But in some things it is important that our young people have a basis on which to build and we should be very mindful of our traditions&mdash;the things that are important not only to this generation but to future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, a person in my electorate came to see me to express his concern about maintaining our traditions. I am referring to Mr Brian Morgan, a school teacher, who has prepared a kit for schools which, coincidentally, is called Anzac. Because of his involvement in music, the kit contains music from the First World War, but it also contains history, geography and other subject lessons&mdash;for example, in physics, the workings of the periscope used by snipers is explained. The educational kit teaches young people about many facets of Anzac&mdash;a good way of imparting to young people exactly what Anzac is all about. </PARA>

Looking at the calibre of our young people coming through our defence establishments like ADFA, Kapooka and Forest Hill in Wagga&mdash;the ones I know quite well&mdash;one can only be very proud. The same comments also apply to the students coming through our schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is very important. I congratulate the Hon. Clyde Holding on bringing this forward to the parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to strongly support the Anzac Day Bill before the House. Like my colleague the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), who has just spoken, I would like to commend our colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) for moving his private member's motion. Five years ago, in April 1990, I had the honour of being part of the parliamentary delegation which attended the 75th anniversary celebrations at Anzac Cove. Subsequently, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 8 May 1990, I wrote an article from which I would like to briefly read. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On April 25, 1915 and in the months following the landing at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli Peninsula, Australia created its own pantheon of secular martyrs. Their acts of collective heroism, under the most difficult physical conditions faced by any army this century, managed to resurrect from an undoubted military defeat a national epic. For over three generations it has nourished the Australian people in a unique way and given this country its only genuine national day acknowledged with equal solemnity throughout the continent.</PARA>
<PARA>Visiting Anzac Cove and seeing in the morning light thousands of Australians of all ages, from every state, from the city and from the country, and, above all, seeing the substantial number of young Australians, mainly backpackers, that had come from all over the world to make sure that they were going to be at Anzac Cove on that morning, was undoubtedly one of the great moments of my political life. It gave to us all a sense of unity of purpose, which I think this nation sorely needs. It demonstrated that in that tradition we have so much in common. On that same occasion, on 25 April 1990, the President of Turkey said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is why the lesson of the Gallipoli campaign will remain unique forever. The friendship that was built among our nations has stood the passage of time. This is the true story of peace. There is no room in our shrinking world for ill feelings and hate and the Gallipoli Campaign is the best example that nations, if they really desire, are capable of building friendly relations even on foundations of past wars. Therefore, this anniversary of the Gallipoli Campaign is not just a time to pay tribute to our dead and to remember the past. It is also a time to look forward and reflect on the virtues of maintaining peace.</PARA>
<PARA>Those remarks, in many respects, tell us all that needs to be said about the real lessons to be learnt from Anzac. As the decades have past and that great army of young men who gave so much for this country and for what they believed in have passed from us into legend and into history, the essential question before us is: what are the lessons that they learnt and passed on to us?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear so much&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;about the lessons of sacrifice and courage, about the lesson of putting one's mates before oneself, about remembering what the essential ingredients of nationhood are really all about. It is about giving people opportunities and common objectives regardless of where they may come from. The important thing is where they are prepared to go together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we live in what is undoubtedly a multicultural society which is very different in many important respects from the Australia of 1914 or even the Australia of 1942. Nevertheless, we can all take great satisfaction from the fact that on Anzac Day we see young men and women from all parts of the world carrying the Australian flag, lining the streets, cheering on the diggers and identifying themselves with those traditions that have made Australia what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Second World War, traditions were passed down to the sons of those who served in the First World War. I was the son of a soldier of the Second World War. I was the nephew of a soldier of the First World War. He left Warrnambool in Victoria as a young man of 18. He went to his regiment, served in Gallipoli and on the Western Front in France and in Belgium. He died at a place called Polygon Wood and he has no known grave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all Australians who go back to those places to see for themselves what their ancestors went through, there is a great lesson to be learnt. Australians served in the Great World War, the war to end all wars, and we suffered a greater loss of our youth proportionately than possibly any other nation on earth, including the United States. Those who inherited those traditions in the Second World War went forward not just to fight for an empire to which they felt a part, as they did in the Great War, but also to fight in a very real sense to protect their own homeland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians served in the Second World War on virtually all the major fronts, whether they be in Europe, the Mediterranean, north Africa, South-East Asia or the Pacific. In a sense the Pacific war was very personal to Australians. They saw the Japanese coming down the Kokoda Trail. For the first time in our history it was really Australia standing entirely alone in the face of the Japanese onslaught. The Americans had come to our aid, but they were still en route and those who were in Australia were poorly trained and had to be equipped for the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Second World War, as in the First, Australian soldiers fought in all those theatres of battle and Australian governments of all complexions offered the best that we had of our people, our equipment and all the resources that this nation had available to it. We were united in that common goal to remove tyranny from the world and to give people a history and a future of which they could be proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for the Great War and the reasons for the Second World War in many respects were different. Historians will tell you, and rightly so, that in many respects the seeds for the Second World War were deeply laid in the outcome of the First World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Australia had a different role in that war because of the Pacific campaigns. We should remember in particular the incredible human suffering of the men of the 8th Division captured in the Malaya and Singapore campaigns. Some claim that they were not sent to the war as well equipped or as well trained as they could have been, but no-one can doubt their courage and their determination to do their best under circumstances which at the time were beyond their capacity alone to change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the campaigns of the Second World War the younger generation of Australians demonstrated exactly the same characteristics as their fathers had at Gallipoli, in the Egyptian campaigns and on the Western Front. They are the traditions which have been passed on to us and are the essential and tangible link between those generations at Gallipoli and the soldiers of today. As has been said by other speakers, the young Australian men and women serving in our armed forces, as regulars or as members of the reserves, are carrying out for this country a role which is absolutely essential for the maintenance of peace and our security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a tendency in our society often to say, `There is no threat. There is no war. Let's run down our defences. We don't need to have so many people in uniform.' The fundamental facts of our history should tell us that, whenever we have allowed the defence of passivism to be by words and not by deeds, it has ultimately cost the blood of thousands upon thousands of our citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we had been better equipped in 1940 to face the risks which were quite evident in both Europe and Asia, it is possible that the events which later took place could have at least been averted or better controlled. Therefore, it is the responsibility of every government to put the defence of the nation as its primary and most sacred responsibility, irrespective of what the short-term situation may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in that context that I want to pay particular tribute to those men and women who have served in major campaigns since the Second World War, such as Korea, the Malayan campaigns on two occasions and subsequently the Vietnam campaign. While most of them were volunteers, in the case of Vietnam they were not all volunteers; there were a considerable number of conscripts as well. Irrespective of whether they came in as volunteers or conscripts, those who served will tell you that when the troops were together they were as one. They shared the common reality that they were there to do a job as well as they possibly could. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the profession of arms in Australia has over the generations been one that has held high respect. So it should, because ultimately it is those men and women who put their lives on the line to protect us, the values we believe in and the concept of family and nation against those elsewhere who may wish to prevail against us. So it was in Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam. Now we see the same attitudes in the United Nations contingents, to which Australia has proudly sent many men and women since the establishment of that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my experience in the Middle East I had the pleasure on many occasions of knowing United Nations officers and seeing them work in truce supervisory roles in the Sinai Desert on the Golan Heights in the front line between Israel and Syria. We have seen them in operational positions between Pakistan and India and in many other parts of the world. The one characteristic which binds them together is their profession of arms. They are professionals and respected as such. In those multinational units to which they are often a part there is always the very strong view that if the Australians are with them they shall prevail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Australia's overall military history since the days of 1914 demonstrate that we were a relatively small contingent in the total allied force, it is also a fact of history&mdash;irrespective of whether we are talking about the Kokoda Trail or Tobruk or whether we go back to the very essence of our traditions at Anzac Cove&mdash;that, while we shared the load with other nations, importantly, our allies knew that we, the Australians, would be there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by once again referring to the aftermath of Anzac and the important lessons that need to be learnt from it. It is very important to also see the effect that a nation can have on its opponents&mdash;its former foes&mdash;and to demonstrate in peace the magnanimity which one obviously cannot show in war but which ultimately demonstrates the degree to which a nation's people are civilised and mature. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take up much of the time of the House but, on behalf of the electors of Fairfax on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, I want to speak in support of the Anzac Day Bill because those electors support it. It is something that they have called for for many years. I am pleased and they are pleased that this bill brings to fruition their wish to have Anzac Day enshrined in legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first contact with the veteran community in a professional sense was when I was on the staff of the Hon. Evan Adermann, who was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the late 1970s. Prior to that, my knowledge of Anzac was what most of us received through education at school and perhaps through the odd game of two-up on Anzac Day when we joined the veterans of World War II in a very special game in the absence of the local constabulary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I worked for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I came to know officers of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. They were professionals. Most of them had experienced the horrors of war and carried that experience with them into the department. They were true professionals. At that time, the department was under the leadership of Sir Richard Kingsland, who in his own right was a war hero. He was a highly decorated pilot in World War II who flew in Britain and also in New Guinea. He was the pilot who rescued Lord Gault from Morocco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of Anzac Day was really brought home to me in 1978 when I had the pleasure of accompanying the minister to France to attend the World Veterans Federation Conference and to link up with a pilgrimage of veterans from Gallipoli through to the Somme and the battlefields of Belgium. The veterans were probably in their 70s and 80s at that time. We visited a very famous battlefield called Villers-Bretonneux where there is a war cemetery of Australian soldiers. The Australians fought magnificently there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), mentioned that wherever Australians fought they are remembered. They are remembered not only by older people. I will never forget the local primary school we visited in France. The children obviously could not speak English but at the beginning of every school day they sang the Marseillaise and also the Australian national anthem before starting their lessons. That was 60 years after the great conflict. The tradition at Villers-Bretonneux continues and forever will enshrine the deeds of the Anzacs in World War I. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a patron of my local TPI association and the ex-POWs association. The veterans in my electorate came to see me specifically. They discussed with me the motion moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and seconded by the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie). It is a motion which this House supported. They felt that the motion did not go far enough. They specifically wanted legislation. As a consequence I prepared a private member's bill, which appeared on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. I informed the RSL that I proposed to move a private member's bill to enshrine Anzac Day as a national day of commemoration so it would be forever on the statute books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in a letter to me in May the National President of the RSL, Digger James, asked me to withdraw that bill. I did withdraw it but I did not stop pursuing that legislation. I see the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is in the House. I am pleased that he is here because that legislation has now come to fruition in very similar terms to the bill that I had proposed. As I said, I hope that Anzac Day will, forever, be a special day for all Australians, especially this year, which commemorates the 50th year of the end of hostilities of World War II. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an honour to take part in this debate on the Anzac Day Bill. I want to take a slightly different tack from a majority of speakers before me and read excerpts from a diary of the great great grandfather of one of my ex-staffers. This was given to me some time ago and I have been wanting the opportunity to do this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He kept a diary during the First World War and in this diary he describes heading off to Europe. Naturally, I cannot read the whole lot&mdash;it goes on page after page&mdash;but I think it gives a feeling of what those young men who left Australia at that time felt when they were about to embark on this tremendous enterprise to bring to a halt the war to end all wars. Unfortunately, it has not, but I think the courage and the actual privations that they went through are very well written in this diary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is handwritten. I have not read it all, but the little excerpts I will read to you will give a flavour of what it was like back in those days. The diary was kept by Corporal James McConnell. The date is 21 June 1917. He writes:</PARA>

<PARA>As I said before, nothing much has changed. To me, this builds up to what these people were going through in their travels and their expectations. This man was an ordinary corporal in the army&mdash;not a major or a general. He travelled to France and he describes the Bay of Biscay on 23 August:</PARA>

<PARA>This is obviously referring to someone who deserted. The diary goes on about the conditions that were experienced. It continues:</PARA>

<PARA>We can only try to imagine the conditions that these people put up with. This diary does not give me enough information of the hell that these people went through. They left a mark on our community. They left a deep psyche within every Australian. I think it is incumbent on us as representatives to make certain that we support our veterans. I have always tried to do that&mdash;not just the veterans of the First World War but the Second World War, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Down in Frankston we have a war veterans home. About seven diggers from the First World War are still there. The average age is about 93. One of the inmates there was at the last Anzac Day ceremony. He was still hale and hearty. Until only a couple of years ago, he used to go down to the local pub every Thursday and have a counter lunch. He is certainly a character. A couple of years ago he went back to Gallipoli with the government's support. He was especially pleased to be able to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people have done a great service for our community.

I, for one, will always support our veterans. I will go in hard for them whenever I can. I am very pleased to see that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is here today. He has always given me good service. He has been down to Frankston a couple of times because he knows of the large veteran community there. This is an important bill. I am very glad that it has the support of all members of this House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been very surprised by this debate on the Anzac Day Bill. We may be declaring this a national day, but I do not doubt for one moment the idea in the mind of the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) is that, whilst he is not coming out and saying it, it replaces Australia Day. Being a person who has lived all of his life in a small western town where I suppose half of its population was of Aboriginal descent, I reflected on the fact that anyone of Aboriginal descent may take some considerable umbrage that the day Australia started was the day the Europeans arrived. I see the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is sitting in the chair over there smirking. There is no doubt in my mind that there would not be a more suitable day for acknowledging our nationalism and our patriotism than the day of Anzac Day.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I can say is that we seem fairly united on this issue. But the sleeper issue has not been dealt with by anyone, and that needs to be said up front. I think there is some difficulty for the people of Aboriginal descent in Australia in coping with the perception that Australia started only with the arrival of the Europeans. In Queensland, our heritage division came out of the Aboriginal heritage division because we saw our heritage as a continuum. We did not see Australia starting suddenly when the Europeans arrived. If you are familiar with the anthropology of Australia pre-touch, to use that technical term, you will realise that there were successive waves of immigration over a long period. A trip through Cape York Peninsula will indicate clearly the significance of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Demographers tell us that one in four Australians who were here before the Second World War had an Aboriginal&mdash;or a first Australian, which is the term I prefer to use&mdash;somewhere in his or her family tree. It may be as many as one in two. Similarly, one in four Australians here before the Second World War had a convict somewhere in his or her family tree. Again, it could be as high as one in two. So there are an awful lot of people whose line did not suddenly start with European settlement in 1788. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to Anzac Day itself. It is very hard for any Australian to talk about some of these things without becoming a little emotional. I was the historian for the 49th Battalion's participation in the war with Indonesia, rather delightfully called Konfrontasi. I was asked to get the history of the 49th Battalion and it took me a good couple of weeks to find out whether it had existed in the Second World War. It was there on paper but I could not find any evidence of what it had done. The reason for that is that its existence during the Second World War was very brief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were sent, the 49th Battalion&mdash;when I say `we', it would be wrong for me to claim to be part of this band of heroes, all volunteers&mdash;to stop the Japanese on the north coast, sometimes referred to as the west cost, of New Guinea. If the Japanese were to capture Port Moresby they would then be in bombing range of Cairns and Townsville. It was absolutely imperative that the airstrips on this side of New Guinea be denied to the Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the 750 men of the 49th Battalion were sent up, as were two or possibly three other battalions and were told, `Stay there; you must stop them.' These men were not well-armed, they were not well-trained; they were all volunteers. Seven hundred and fifty of them walked into position in the Buna and Gone, the Sanananda area, and 28 of them walked out of position some months later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the performance of the 49th Battalion was a very brief one. If any of us are lucky enough to have our names associated with that band of heroes we can stand very proud, even if our relationship is remote. Thanks to those people we had time to bring back the 6th and 9th divisions, battle hardened from Africa, to confront the Japanese at Milne Bay, stop the occupation of Port Moresby and deny the Japanese the airstrips that they had been bombing once a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, at one stage they bombed Horn Island in the Torres Strait every second day. That part of Australia got one terrible hammering. But that hammering was not inflicted upon the far greater populations of Cairns and Townsville because of the bravery, heroism and sacrifice&mdash;for the greater proportion of them, the sacrifice of their lives&mdash;of the people of the 49th Battalion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very hard to see the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gallipoli</EMPHASIS>, which should be compulsory viewing for all Australian children, very few of whom are exposed to that part of our history, without being profoundly moved. Soon after its release, I was at the War Memorial in Canberra, which at that time sadly was being turned into a peace museum&mdash;to quote some of the advocates of that point of view&mdash;and there was a young fellow with a young family standing in front of the Gallipoli diorama, and he was crying. Big tears were rolling down his face. I must say that it was hard for me not to go the same way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having spoken about the sentimental part of our history, and the part that we can be immensely proud of as Australians, I would like to turn to another more serious aspect. After the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the former Leader of the Opposition sent letters of support to the gay mardi gras, I thought it was rather important to take flags around to children in schools in my electorate and tell them what they can be proud of as Australians. I ask them whether they think the Germans were good fighters. Some of them get it right; they say yes, the Germans held the rest of the world at bay for almost five years almost by themselves, so they were extraordinarily good soldiers and effective in the art of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask: where were the Germans stopped? It is a very sad reflection upon history lessons and the education system in Australia that not one single school that I have been to&mdash;and I have probably addressed thousands of kids at this stage&mdash;was able to tell me where they were stopped. Some of them get close; they say Stalingrad. But, of course, the Germans were first stopped effectively at Tobruk, and the people that stopped them essentially were the Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then I ask whether the Japanese were good fighters. Kids always seem to think the Japanese weren't. I say: `In 75 years of land warfare this warrior-like race of people were never beaten. They beat the Russians. They beat the Americans. They beat the Chinese. They beat everybody.' I ask: where were they first stopped? The kids, with great pride at this stage, get the idea of the game we are playing and they know, thank goodness, that they were stopped in New Guinea. I ask them: who stopped them? And they shout out, `The Australians.' We were the people who stopped the Germans. We were the people that stopped the Japanese. We are a great race of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go on and talk about the leadership that we have enjoyed in Australia. Unfortunately, the leadership that we have enjoyed in Australia has not been a great leadership. We might be a great race of people, but our leadership, I am afraid, has been something else. Yes, we landed on the shores of Gallipoli and the whole might of the British Empire was thrown at the soft underbelly of Europe and we were not able to make it off the beaches because the soft underbelly of Europe was not quite as soft as Mr Churchill and the English people had thought it was. We were turned into cannon fodder in somebody else's war. That is what happened. That is a message that should be brought down to every single one of us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Second World War, where were our troops when we were under imminent danger from Japan? Why did the 49th Battalion have to go up to defend Australia, people who were almost totally untrained and unarmed? They were off fighting in Africa. We were defending the Africans. I do not know why. But that is why they were there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must now mention a person's name&mdash;Mr Curtin. I was reading a book which says that Mr Curtin was a very outstanding person. It was one of the very few history books I have ever put down. I was so angry that I could not bear to read it any longer. Mr Curtin was the man who consistently led in this House the votes to stop Australia from arming. Even though people like William Wentworth stood in this House and said that Japan was an extremely aggressive nation and was determined to make war in Asia&mdash;and we are in Asia&mdash;and even though people pushed that point time and time again, the votes were cut down in this place by the leadership of no other person than Mr Curtin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we went to the war with Wirraway aeroplanes, which were a joke and did not manage to bring down a single Japanese aircraft. Almost every plane, whose pilot had the bravery and courage to go up against the Japanese, was brought down. We had virtually no tanks. We were the only country fighting in the Second World War that had no conscription, thanks to our leadership&mdash;we did have conscription, but no conscript could be sent overseas because we were still fighting the internecine battles of the ALP, dating back to the days of Billy Hughes and the First World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had electricity rationing in Australia throughout the whole of the Second World War because the coalminers were on strike and on go-slows for the duration. While 650 Australians were being killed in Darwin these fellows did not have intestinal fortitude. As happened in the First World War, this country was listening to principles that were being espoused by other people. We were fighting someone else's war; we were fighting for someone else's reasons. That is why we were left where we were and why our men had to go to the war. I have cited just one battalion, the 49th Battalion&mdash;150 men from that battalion went to the war and 28 came home. People in the parliament of Australia did not have any commitment to the defence of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went to the Vietnam War. Tanks are the most important weapon in ground warfare. What was the cavalry in the old days is still called the cavalry today. The only effective weapon on the ground against tanks is anti-tank weapons. The 3.5 rocket launcher fired head-on will not dent a modern day tank, so unless you are going to sneak around behind it&mdash;and that is a rather good, fun kind of thing to try to do&mdash;you have to use a Karl Gustav. In the Vietnam War, that was the only piece of equipment we had available to defend ourselves against tank attacks, which were very common in Vietnam. But we could not use that equipment because we did not have any ammunition. We had done business with the Swedes who had decided we should not be in Vietnam so we went there without any effective anti-tank weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People say that there is no impending danger now but there was no impending danger in 1938-39. We quite happily sent all our troops to fight in Europe and Africa in 1939&mdash;we had no impending danger to Australia. At the moment we have virtually none of our combat necessities&mdash;helicopters&mdash;in an operational condition. Whilst I do not want to be quoted on the figures, I think we have 49 of these helicopters&mdash;and three are in operating order at present. The Jindalee so-called forward warning system that Australia needs for its defences&mdash;and an excellent proposal it is&mdash;is just a cleared piece of land; there is nothing on that land at Longreach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our infantrymen have no surface-to-air missiles. One lesson from the Second World War is that when the Japanese had air control they won every battle. When they lost air control after the battle of Midway, they did not win a battle. So air control is absolutely, vitally, critically and overwhelmingly important, yet our infantry does not have any effective means of combating attack from the air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though the heroism of Australians held the Japanese up, there is no way Australia could stand against Japan. The thing that saved Australia ultimately was the United States and its determination to deny Australia to the Japanese. The Australian government of the day, the ALP government&mdash;and then, as I understand the history books, it was agreed to by the incoming Menzies government&mdash;had agreed to give the top half of Australia to the Japanese; that part of Australia where my family has lived for the last 130 years was to be handed over to the Japanese because it could not be defended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, 82 per cent of the surface area of Australia, starting just north of Cairns and 30 or 40 miles west of the east coast of Queensland, is virtually unpopulated. It contains about four per cent of the Australian population, and even that is contained in three or four cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia had been invaded by Japan, why would the United States have come to protect it? The United States was not racing off to protect England against the Germans, so why in heaven's name would it choose to get involved in a war to protect Australia? It was not prepared to protect Australia in the Second World War, but the leadership of Australia thinks that somehow they are going to change its mind entirely&mdash;its historic attitude&mdash;and it is going to come racing over here to defend Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This place must realise that if we were British then&mdash;that was the logic on which we were fighting at Anzac, and there was a lot of logic attached to that&mdash;I do not think anyone considers that we are British today. We are Australian. This country has not recognised the fact that if there is an independent nation then it must have some independent ability to protect itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deciding principle of international territorial law was the reach of a cannon shot, 20 or 30 miles. It said that it was your territory if you could defend it with a cannon. If it is what we can defend in Australia today, then I think we had better take down our flag. I am not too sure which one we should run to the masthead, because we do not have the ability to defend ourselves today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, when we talk about the great heroism and the great sacrifice made by Australians in war after war, it was in the teeth of betrayal by the leadership of Australia. In an article written by Richard Blandy&mdash;no raving right winger, that is for sure; he is most certainly not on our side of politics&mdash;he simply gives the population figures. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The population in Australia in 1947 was 5 1/2 million, in 1992 was 17.8 million, in the year 2020 it will rise to 19 million, in the year 2045 it will decrease to 13 million, and by this time next century, 2095, the Australian population will be six million.</PARA>
<PARA>There will be six million people living in Australia. These are not my figures; they are from a person who does not share my political beliefs at all. They are from Richard Blandy, the Director of the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at Melbourne University. He gives the figures for Indonesia. He said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I would like to thank everyone who has been involved in the debate on the Anzac Day Bill. It has probably been one of the more emotional debates. Apart from appropriation bills and bills like that, where people can get up and speak about anything, this has probably attracted more speakers than any other bill for some time. I acknowledge the presence in the House of the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a few comments about some of the things that have been said in this debate. I will also make some comments of my own, having now been the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for some 10 months. I do not think that I could possibly let go one of the comments made by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) when he attacked the leadership of Mr John Curtin. He can have his view of history and say it in the colourful way that he usually does, but perhaps I could give him a little lesson on history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 5 July this year, the 50th anniversary of John Curtin's death will be commemorated. There are many people of that time&mdash;I acknowledge that the honourable member for Kennedy and I were not here then&mdash;who will say that, arguably, the Second World War caused Mr Curtin's early demise. If the honourable member wants to, he can read a book written by a veteran by the name of Colonel John Buckley&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6J4">Mr SCIACCA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not interject while you were speaking and I would ask you now to listen. You were the one who criticised John Curtin and I want to make sure that the facts are put on the table. Colonel John Buckley, an ex-serviceman, wrote a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recollections of the Roving Staff Officer</EMPHASIS>. He talked about early February 1942 when the convoy known as the `stepsister convoy' was coming over to this country from northern Africa with a lot of troops. Winston Churchill countermanded the order of Curtin and asked it to go to Burma. It was Curtin himself who, according to the book, stayed up all night&mdash;I understand, praying to God&mdash;with his senior adviser and his major adviser at the time. He had been told by intelligence that, in the event that the convoy going to Australia was redirected to go to New Guinea&mdash;which subsequently happened&mdash;there was a good chance it would be sunk. He made the decision in the morning to direct it to Australia and countermanded Churchill's order. The rest is history. The Australians came, went to New Guinea and fought. Arguably, the Kokoda Trail battles were one of the turning points in the war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place that on the record because, although I can understand the honourable member giving his version of history, I want to tell the correct version. Whilst he might consider that there are people of that time who need to be attacked, I really do not think that the debate on this bill is where one should make those sorts of points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having swatted that away, let me say that the contributions of members in this debate have been excellent. I do not think that anyone could deny the emotionalism that has entered this debate. In particular, I remember watching the television, because I was not able to be here for the long debates that ensued, and seeing the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) talking about the bill and getting very emotional at the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also welcome the contribution of the shadow minister who made some very telling points throughout the debate. He has had the opportunity, along with me, of getting to meet many of those people from not only the Gallipoli era&mdash;there are not that many of them left&mdash;but World War II and subsequent conflicts. The Anzac spirit, which was forged on the hills of Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, is still alive and well and has been shown at every available opportunity by our Australian service men and women in other conflicts and is still being shown by our peacekeeping forces around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute today to those people who saw fit to lobby the government and the parliament on the question of introducing this bill to make Anzac Day the national day of commemoration. I thank the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) for their efforts in this regard and, in particular, for putting the private member's bill before the House&mdash;where it received bipartisan support and where I know this bill will receive that same bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end it was the efforts of the ex-service community, through petitions and lobbying members, that eventually got us to the stage where I was able to take this bill before the cabinet and quickly get it approved so that it could become law on this important 50th anniversary of the end of World War II in this Australia Remembers year. There are too many people to mention in this regard. Since becoming the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I have met so many wonderful people&mdash;people who are the genuine salt of the earth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to be fortunate sometimes, and I guess that that time was mine when I was appointed Minister for Veterans' Affairs in such an important year&mdash;a golden moment in the history of this country&mdash;when we celebrate and commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war that was of great importance to this country, a war where people fought not only for other countries but for our country on our soil. Darwin and Broome were bombed. There were midget submarines in Sydney Harbour. Townsville was strafed. There are incredible stories about this war. Out of a population of fewer than six million people, one million were under arms. The other four or five million who were at home were also helping. I call them, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has called them, an heroic generation. These people not only went to war but lived and breathed it for six years and, at the same time, went through a depression. I thank those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention a couple of people. I am sure the honourable member for O'Connor will agree with me in mentioning the likes of Digger James, the National President of the RSL; and Bruce Ruxton, the Victorian president. I did not know how I was going to handle Bruce when I first became the minister. I had heard of his reputation far and wide. I was told that he called a spade a spade, and he certainly does. Some people, including Digger James himself, will argue that, amongst the ex-service community&mdash;particularly in the RSL&mdash;Bruce Ruxton is probably one of the more famous and one of the more genuine of all ex-service people that have been involved in helping the ex-service community. Digger James named Sir William Keys as another such person; no doubt there have been others as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record my appreciation for their assistance and, within reason, their cooperation; when they do not like something, they certainly tell you quite forcefully. I appreciate their efforts, not only in cooperating and having a dialogue with me as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs but, more importantly, in their heavy advocacy for the ex-service community. I could mention many others. I would particularly like to mention Commodore Geoff Michael of the RAAF Association, and Guy Griffiths. Last night I addressed the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council, known as AVADSC. Members of the council looked after me. We had a beautiful meal. I also mention Nobby Clark from the naval association; the list goes on and on. There are so many people that I cannot mention them all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Friday I addressed about 100 people at a luncheon at the Port Kembla RSL. They told me that I was the first minister they had seen there for some years. I think Rex Connor was the last one to have visited that particular RSL. My adviser, Shane Wells, said, `Gee, they're nice people, aren't they?' I said, `Yes, they are.' All of those people are like that. It is not something that you find in isolation. These people are real salt of the earth people. I enjoy being with them. I do not say that lightly; I certainly do not say it as rhetoric. I say it because I mean it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear about what our ex-prisoners of war went through, of the deprivations they suffered. I have spoken on a number of occasions to Max Jagger, the National President of the Ex-Prisoners of War Association, and others from the association. They tell me of the trials and tribulations they went through, but then they tell me of the good things&mdash;of the ingenuity that they showed in simply being able to survive, of how they made good with everything they could get their hands on. That leads me back to what Anzac is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, it was on the hills of Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 that Australia was really born as a nation in the sense that it became known in other countries as a distinct nation. That was when people stood up, took notice and said, `By gees, these Australians are fairly good people. They are good fighters and they are good people.' I think that a lot of people would argue that that sense of mateship, that sense of humour and the independence and ingenuity of these Australians really made the Australian character. We have been known for these qualities for so long but only since then. Until then, we were just regarded as a federation of states. Although we lost the battle I think that on that day the Anzac spirit was born, as was, I believe, Australian nationalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to say too much about the Australia Remembers program today because I intend to make a ministerial statement to this House on Thursday on what is happening within the Australia Remembers year. I will set out the infrastructure, explain how it will be working and outline some of the major events then, so I will not say much about that now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a number of venues, I have heard the honourable member for O'Connor saying certain things which he again said when speaking on this bill. He has heard me say this as well, but I say this again to get it clearly on the record: if the Anzac spirit were born on the hills of Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, surely that same spirit must have come of age and blossomed during World War II when these people&mdash;who are mostly in their 70s&mdash;fought for this country and won. I do not say that to in any way denigrate what we are talking about here today. They continued that spirit and it flourished because they fought in this country and in New Guinea, which was part of Australia as a protectorate at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that because, of the 320,000 people who went over and fought in World War I, approximately 60,000 never returned. There was an enormously high percentage of casualties. It is a casualty rate which is just incredible in modern times. The casualty rate for those who went overseas in World War II was nowhere near as bad. I think that the honourable member for O'Connor said this in his speech, but the military planners of those days worked on the basis of whoever was left standing was the winner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the honour of going to Villers-Bretonneux in France and seeing rows and rows of graves of young Australians. I have been to other war cemeteries around the world and I have seen it. When I think of those 18-year-old and 19-year-old boys buried overseas, in some small way I can relate to the thoughts their parents must have had when they never returned. When one considers that these people were, in effect, kids, it really does put a different perspective on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I talk to school children and the youth of today about the Australia Remembers program, I say to them, `When you watch people on Anzac Day marching down the streets, don't picture them as people who are over 70 years of age. Try to image them 50 years ago because they were your age.' They were just kids who were members of the regular army, navy and air force. They were people who were conscripted for the war effort. One of the major legacies that is going to be left with our young people in this Australia Remembers year is education. If we can achieve that then, in my view, the whole year has been a success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much appreciate the bipartisan nature of this debate. This bill is something which the ex-service community has been looking for for some time. It needed to be done because 25 April each year is now enshrined as the national day of commemoration. That has absolutely nothing to do with Australia Day. Australia Day stays where it is. The debate as to when that should be can continue. Anzac Day remains 25 April every year. This bill will make sure that happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would not be proper if I did not make just a few comments on some of the contributions in this debate. I was rather disappointed, particularly in the spirit of the bipartisan nature of this debate, with the contribution of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). I can understand his eagerness at the time to please those woodcutters or timber workers in the gallery from his own electorate. However, I feel that in future he should use another bill to make what I consider to be fairly dubious political points. I will not say any more than that because I do not mind the member for Gippsland. He and I get on very well. However, on this occasion I think he could have used another venue to make his comments. I do not think this was the right time for him to make such comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the comments of the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), who is a Vietnam veteran and a well-meaning person with very strong views. I respect him for those views. However, some things that he said are just not right. It would not be right of me to not put them to rest also. He made certain accusations about the Prime Minister using Australia Remembers year for some sort of cheap political gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister will not do that. I hope he does not mind me saying this, but he has absolute respect and great fondness for our veteran community. When I became the minister, one of the first things I was called upon to do was to go with Dame Beryl Beaurepaire, then chairperson of the Australian War Memorial, to obtain more funds for the war memorial. He knows the fiscal problems that any government has, but he still agreed. When the Australia Remembers thought came into my mind and that of some of my staff members, I went to him to ask for support. I readily got that support. At the national launch of Australia Remembers, he got out of his sick bed to launch the program. He did not do anything else. It was the only thing he was prepared to get out of his bed for. He went straight back to bed and was off for another three or four days. I know this because, when I went to Perth to get the money from cabinet, he was not there to help me along. However, cabinet itself was happy with the idea. Those who have read the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sandakan: the last march</EMPHASIS> by Don Wall probably would have seen the photograph on page 183 of Private William Matthew Keating, 8th Division, Postal Unit, Annandale, killed at Sandakan 3 February, 1945 aged 36 years. I will not say anything more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want the member for McPherson to understand that the Prime Minister has a deep feeling on these matters. The member might not agree with the Prime Minister on everything but, when it comes to this matter, the Prime Minister is fair dinkum. Some people have criticised us because we have not got the flag on our logo. If they look at the badge on the logo, they will see that it is pretty small. We could not fit anything else in. I commend this bill to the House. It is something which we probably should have done a long time ago. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1993-94 budget the government announced details of a disability wage supplement which began on 1 July 1994. The wage supplement seeks to promote work force participation by people with a disability. The wage supplement is subject to essentially the same eligibility criteria as the disability support pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill proposes to exempt the wage supplement from income tax for those recipients under age pension age.

The rebate will negate the tax on the wage supplement for a full-rate recipient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Measures in the bill will also ensure that bereavement payments related to the wage supplement are given similar tax treatment to bereavement payments related to the disability support pension.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Life insurance companies</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two measures contained in this bill relating to life insurance companies give effect to an announcement made by me on 30 June 1994. The first measure relates to dividends payable to life insurance companies satisfied through the issue of bonus shares which form part of the assets of the insurance funds of a life insurance company. The normal situation with dividends paid to companies is that they are subject to the intercorporate dividend rebate. Because of this, where bonus shares are issued in satisfaction of a dividend, the amount of the dividend is not treated as constituting part of the cost of the shares when calculating any profit or loss on their disposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a life insurance company, however, no intercorporate dividend rebate is available for dividends paid to its insurance funds. This results in an element of double taxation. The bill will correct this unintended result in respect of bonus shares disposed of from 1 July 1994. The second measure concerns the rate of the intercorporate dividend rebate allowable to a life insurance company in respect of non-insurance fund dividends included in its taxable income. These dividends are eligible for the intercorporate dividend rebate, but the rate of rebate currently allowable is the average rate of tax paid on the total income of a life insurance company. The average rate is lower than the rate paid on non-fund dividends. The bill will ensure that, from the 1994-95 year of income, the rate of rebate equals the rate of tax actually paid. Neither measure is expected to result in significant costs to revenue. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will include in the assessable income of friendly societies and certain other registered organisations income derived from certain assets of the organisation. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the provisions of division 8A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are not circumvented by the holding of assets separate from the eligible insurance business of the organisation. The amendments will apply to income derived from eligible investment assets derived or purchased on or after 1 July 1994 by a registered organisation.

This will be achieved by treating the assets as having been sold and the liabilities met at the time of the sale and then having been bought or assumed again immediately after the sale. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1994 is an omnibus tax bill which contains 17 different measures. It is not to be opposed by the coalition. Provisions in this bill can be grouped into the categories of business taxation, personal taxation and tax administration. The majority of the amendments relate to business taxation, however. The bill sets out to amend four principal acts. These are the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Taxation Administration Act 1953, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 and the Ombudsman Act 1976.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the first of two tax bills which are scheduled to come before the House this week, the other being the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994. This bill is also the second tax bill debated that contains compliance cost impact statements. When speaking on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1994 on 17 November last year, I congratulated the government on introducing these statements, but I reserved judgment on whether the innovation would prove to be worth while. Unfortunately, it is already apparent that the statements are too broad and general to be useful to taxpayers and to their advisers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A genuine attempt to put a figure on the compliance costs of a measure was anticipated, but the statement so far has failed to do this. It smacks again of Labor paying lip-service to seriously held concerns. No dollar figures are mentioned. Even a guesstimate of the dollar cost would be far better than the statement so far provided. In addition, it seems to ignore that the costs of tax advisers and accountants reviewing the bills and explanatory memoranda will be absorbed by the taxpayers in their compliance costs. Let us hope that the government can improve the calibre of information provided in future by way of compliance cost statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments are included in schedule 1 of the bill&mdash;as are all amendments, unless otherwise specified&mdash;and relate to business taxation. The bill makes amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act relating to bonus shares and intercompany dividend rebates. This is dealt with in part 1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, where life insurance companies receive bonus shares in satisfaction of assessable dividends and those shares are included in the insurance funds of the company, that amount is not included in the cost of shares eventually sold to determine the profit or loss on the sale. This involves an element of double taxation. The bill, however, removes the double taxation problem by including the amount assessed in the cost of bonus shares when determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. This should ensure that life companies are placed on the same basis as individual taxpayers who receive and subsequently sell bonus shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may not be generally known that life insurance companies pay tax at different rates on the various components of taxable income. This usually results in the average tax rate of a company in the industry as a whole being less than the tax rate on dividends in the non-fund component of taxable income of the same company. Life companies are entitled to an intercompany dividend rebate on their non-insurance fund dividends included in taxable income. However, currently the rebate is calculated by applying the average rate of tax paid on total taxable income rather than the rate actually paid on non-fund dividends. Therein lies the element of some double taxation. The bill eliminates this doubling up by allowing the intercompany dividend rebate to be calculated using the average rate of tax payable on the non-fund class of income rather than the lower overall tax rate paid by the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of the bill clarifies the rules relating to the cost price of a natural increase in livestock. It provides that natural increases in livestock where there is no minimum value are valued at the actual cost of production for that year of income where taxpayers elect to value such stock at cost. Currently, for classes of livestock for which no minimum value is prescribed, the law allows some producers to use historical costs that have become negligible compared with actual costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns have been raised, particularly in the rural communities, that the government is now examining the option of eliminating minimum prescribed values. This is an issue upon which the coalition seeks from the government firm clarification of its intent and a commitment that minimum prescribed values will not be eliminated. The farming sector is concerned for good reason. Where actual value is used instead of a prescribed minimum value, the valuation of livestock will be of a much higher value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum gives us an example of the determination of the actual value of a natural increase of 20 ostriches which includes costs such as artificial insemination, feeding, veterinary costs, labour costs and the like. In most cases, actual costs are greater than prescribed minimum values. So, if the government eliminated the prescribed minimum values, farmers would incur higher tax bills on unrealised gains. It makes more sense for gains to be taxed when they are realised; that is, when the animals are actually sold. The government should make it clear that it is committed to the retention of prescribed minimum values, especially now with the rural sector suffering hardships due to the consequences of drought and poor commodity prices, to name a couple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 5 ensures that panel vans and utility trucks that carry one tonne or more are treated in the same manner irrespective of whether they are derived from passenger motor vehicles. These vehicles will qualify for accelerated depreciation rates instead of the general depreciation rates. The amendment removes the current tax advantage to locally produced one-tonners depending on whether they are derived from passenger vehicles. In addition, it amends related capital gains tax and rollover provisions to maintain consistency of language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, registered organisations, including friendly societies, are exempt on most income apart from non-complying superannuation funds and on complying superannuation roll-overs, eligible annuities and insurance business. Part 7 of the bill sets out to amend sections 116E and 116GA of the Income Tax Assessment Act to include the assessable income of registered organisations from eligible investment assets&mdash;abbreviated as EIAs&mdash;derived or purchased on or after 1 July 1994. The amendment aims to prevent registered organisations from circumventing Division 8A by holding assets separate from eligible insurance business such as through a separate fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments were originally introduced in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 and were withdrawn to allow further consultation with industry. These amendments are substantially the same as those in the earlier bill, the major difference being that assessable income of registered organisations will include income from EIAs derived or purchased after 1 July 1994 as opposed to income earned on or after 1 July 1994 from EIAs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 8 of the bill deals with three transitional tax matters flowing from the sale of private interests of the State Bank of New South Wales. Upon purchase by MLC, or any other company for that matter, the bank will lose its tax exempt status. The bill provides that the tax treatment of assets held by the State Bank at the time of its sale, but subsequently disposed of, will only be determined by reference to gains or losses accrued after the sale. This will ensure that appropriate gains and losses accrued in assets and liabilities at the time of the sale are not taken into account in determining its post sale taxable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill denies deductions for superannuation contributions made after the State Bank sale that are in respect of liabilities accrued up to the time of the sale when the bank was exempt from tax. This bill also denies deductions for bad debts written off after the sale, to the extent that the debts were covered by a provision for doubtful debts at the time of the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Capital gains tax amendments are made in part 9 of these measures. The bill aims to ensure that certain transactions involving the creation of assets, and which effectively assign non-corporeal interests, will be subject to capital gains tax. An example of the created assets to which the amendment will apply is a future interest in a professional partnership. This amendment arises out of the decision of the High Court in the case of the Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Everett (1980). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of changes to the new company tax instalment arrangements are also proposed in part 10, which commenced for small and medium sized taxpayers from the 1994-95 year, and for large taxpayers from the 1995-96 year. It repeals the existing anti-avoidance provision&mdash;section 221 AZU&mdash;of the new company tax instalment arrangements and replaces it with three measures designed to target tax avoidance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first measure proposed will insert a specific provision dealing with arrangements with associated taxpayers seeking to defer or reduce instalments by shifting income or deductions between associated companies. The second measure will ensure that, where a taxpayer lodges an upwards estimate after paying an instalment, the taxpayer is required to pay the shortfall in the instalment at the time of lodging the estimate. Currently, taxpayers can obtain a refund for all or part of instalments already paid by lodging an artificially low first estimate immediately before the due date of the third instalment, and then lodging a realistic estimate immediately after the date. In the third measure, part 10 also provides that where a taxpayer lodges a downwards estimate of tax liability for the purpose of delaying instalments, by being classified as a small taxpayer, the estimate has no effect on the taxpayers classification. Currently, taxpayers can lodge artificially low estimates before the test date, and then revise upwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also allows the tax amount on which instalments are based to be varied by regulation where tax rates are changed from one year to another. Proposed also are consequential amendments to the provisions which impose a penalty for late payment and interest on underpayment so that the penalty and interest calculations commence on the final instalment date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 10 also amends section 166A of the Income Tax Assessment Act so that the Commissioner is deemed to have made an assessment on the day a return is lodged by companies and trustees of certain funds whether the lodgment is before, on or after the due date for lodgment for final payment of tax or final instalment date. The effect is that taxpayers will be entitled to a refund on an assessment and they will receive early refunds when their returns are lodged early rather than, as is the case now, having to wait until the due date for lodgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 11 amends the controlled foreign company, or CFC, provisions relating to general insurance companies by replacing the definitions of tainted calculated liabilities and calculated liabilities with definitions that reflect the outstanding claims concept which is used in the general insurance industry but not the life insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments in part 2 of schedule 2 relate to the deferral of quarterly payments for the superannuation guarantee. Proposals in this bill will ensure that the annual superannuation contribution requirements applying until 30 June 1994 under the superannuation guarantee regime are retained until that regime is more established. This implements the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) of 28 June 1994 that the requirement that employers meet their superannuation guarantee obligation on a quarterly basis is to be deferred. Employers are therefore able to continue satisfying their superannuation guarantee obligations by making contributions on an annual basis for 1994-95 and in later years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An onus to make the superannuation guarantee contributions quarterly would add to the current problems with small superannuation amounts. This measure will be introduced with 12 months notice to employers, we are informed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deferral of quarterly superannuation contributions highlights one of the problems with the government's practice of legislation by press release. The government has failed to put into place or even introduce legislation to defer the quarterly contribution scheme by the date that some employers would have been required to pay their quarterly superannuation contribution. Employers were thus left to decide whether to follow the letter of the law as it stands or follow the Treasurer's announcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also make the point that the amendment in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1994, relating to the return of deducted superannuation contributions, was applied retrospectively to 1 July 1988, yet the superannuation guarantee matter dealt with in this bill applies from the date of the press release on 1 July 1994. The former, you might be surprised to learn, was a revenue raiser for the government, and the latter is revenue neutral. This is indicative of a lack of a consistent approach by the government to taxation policies. It would have been more honest to have included both measures in the same bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Labor, retrospectivity only applies where there is a revenue windfall to the government. Yet where taxpayers might benefit there is no such retrospectivity. There are two amendments affecting personal taxation, Mr Speaker, but if it suits the convenience of the House I might interrupt my remarks here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Treasurer. I refer him to reports concerning the state of the Australian economy since the mid-1980s. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the progress made in improving the economic position since that time?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="575" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of comments that have been made by the shadow Treasurer in which he talks about the fact that the economy has not essentially improved since the mid-1980s because the current account deficit is forecast to be back over 5 1/2 per cent for this year; and for 1985-86 it was 6.1 per cent. So he asserts, essentially, that there is no improvement on the basis of the current account deficit being back to similar levels. The fact is, as everyone who is in any way an objective observer realises, there has been much improvement in the Australian economy since that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to some of the relevant features of that improvement. As we know, the inflation rate is much less than it was back in the mid-1980s. The underlying rate then was 9 per cent; it is now 2 1/4 per cent and the headline rate of 8.4 per cent is down to 3 1/4 per cent. That improved inflation rate feeds into&mdash;along with other factors&mdash;improved competitiveness. Our competitiveness has increased by some 12 1/2 per cent in that time, which means that we are much more able to compete in international markets, increase our exports and compete with imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That increased competitiveness means that our ratio of exports to GDP has been able to increase very considerably. Australian manufacturers and Australian service providers are able increasingly to export to other countries. In constant prices, the ratio of exports to GDP has increased from just over 14 1/2 per cent in the mid-1980s to 21 1/2 per cent for this current financial year. In other words, there has been almost a 50 per cent increase in the proportion of exports to GDP. That is an extraordinary increase in a short time and reflects the fact that the basic economy is such that people can export much more capably now than was the case in the slack economy we inherited from the previous government. The composition of exports reflects that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in the mid-1980s, commodities were three-quarters of total exports and manufactured exports were less than 10 per cent. They are now 19 per cent and commodities have gone from three-quarters to just under 60 per cent. Those improvements to Australia's external capabilities are tremendously important. It is on the basis of having that improvement that we are able to have a debt servicing ratio now which is markedly less than it was in the mid-1980s; and amazingly less than it was at the end of the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interest payments on debt as a proportion of exports were 15 per cent in the mid-1980s, 21 per cent at the end of the 1980s but only 11 per cent now. We are much more capable of servicing our debt than was the case previously. That in part reflects the fact that exports have grown so much more rapidly than GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore the case that we have seen a major change in the Australian economy. We are much more capable of exporting; much more internationally related; much more competitive; and those factors were noted by Standard and Poor's in their recent reaffirming of Australia's credit rating, when they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Improvements in overseas competitiveness and growth prospects have been driven by important shifts in government policy over the past decade.</PARA>
<PARA>In reaffirming our credit rating, they noted the fact that there have been these distinct improvements. That gave us the capacity to maintain our credit rating. In looking to the future, we can expect that our current account will be the beneficiary of some important changes, and today's ABARE outlook report shows that it expects a considerable change in commodity exports. In this current year, they are forecast to fall slightly in absolute money terms by about a quarter of a billion dollars. Next year they are expected to increase by $5 billion, because of the breaking of the drought, because of the improved prices and because of improved volumes on non-rural commodities. So the outlook in terms of commodities is far, far better for next year than it is for this year, and that gives us hope for improvement on the balance of payments in the forthcoming year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure members will be aware that as from 1 September 1994 we had a policy of brand substitution for common drugs that would save consumers, on average, $1.40 for every prescription&mdash;some considerably more than that. It was a program that was welcomed generally by the opposition&mdash;although not in all quarters by the medical profession and certainly not by some of the multinational pharmaceutical companies.</PARA></TALK.START>

What it is doing is issuing to doctors `brand substitution not permitted' stamps.

We will also outlaw those rubber stamps. It is not sufficient, in my view, to simply say that the doctors' and the pharmacists' interests outweigh those of the patients.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It comes strange from the opposition to be raising questions about a breach of promise on tax when it was the Treasurer of 1978, the now Leader of the Opposition, who came into this House and broke a promise completely in relation to income tax cuts&mdash;tax cuts which had been passed into l-a-w law, the fistful of dollars. He came in with a proposal for an income tax surcharge and halving tax indexation, the effect of which was to take away, virtually absolutely, the tax cuts which had been previously legislated. That is the history. The now Leader of the Opposition did that. Given that, it smacks of extraordinary hypocrisy to make allegations about some breach of promise by us in relation to tax when in fact there has been no breach of promise with respect to the first leg. You will find out in a few months time what happens to the second leg.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the opposition's background, what an extraordinary amount of hypocrisy. When this action was taken, it led to headlines on newspapers: `Lies, lies, lies'. It was seen by the Australian people as a total breach of promise. That is where the name `Honest John' came from. It was a send-up. He was not called Honest John because they thought he was so honest; it was a send-up of someone who was involved in a total breach of promise to the Australian people on taxation. It was also associated with other increases in indirect taxes. So when we hear those opposite say, `What happened to the l-a-w law tax cuts?', everyone should remember that it was John Howard&mdash;the Treasurer back in the late 1970s&mdash;who broke absolutely the promise of tax cuts which were in l-a-w law and who accompanied them with indirect tax increases.</PARA>

In fact, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper recently pointed out that consumer credit went down by 4.2 per cent, petrol by 1.4 per cent, shoes by 2.3 per cent and restaurant meals by 1.8 per cent. These are all figures taken from the ABS CPI statistics for the December 1994 quarter. So we had some prices for consumers actually dropping at the same time as the economy was growing rapidly and hundreds of thousands of jobs were being created.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The December CPI figures show an underlying inflation rate for the quarter of 2.1 per cent, and this is despite growth in the economy of 5 1/2 per cent. We can safely say from those figures that we are now a low inflation country. We have achieved a structural improvement in inflation over the past decade because of increased competitive pressures; in other words, the government's reform of things such as the exchange rate, tariff reductions and opening up the economy to competition has paid off, not only for companies but also for consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These falls in prices were despite the effects of the drought. It has to be admitted that the effects of the drought on the CPI in months ahead may see price rises. However, we can say that the effects of the drought would have been much more damaging but for the structural changes. The Australian economy is now more resilient and flexible in responding to drought or fluctuations in commodity prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing is clear, and that is that businesses are benefiting from a decade of structural reform and are having to respond to increased competition whether they are petrol retailers in a price war or restaurants or fast food outlets fighting for market share. But there are even bigger gains for consumers if we move quickly to the next stage of micro-economic reform, and that is to a national competition framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members can get an idea of the huge potential gains when they look at yesterday's report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper which was commenting on the Industry Commission's work on the benefits of a national competition policy. It is worth reminding the House of some of those statistics. Savings of $9 billion a year for consumers work out at around $1,500 a household. There are enormous savings potentially in gas, electricity and legal bills. I can say that any policy that has the potential to raise GDP by five per cent a year can only be described as a blockbuster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government is still seeking to achieve the cooperation of the states on competition policy reform. I can say that the states will have to show a much more mature outlook to the national competition reforms than they did last year in Darwin. I can inform the House that if they do not do that the federal government will go it alone. The potential savings are just too important to let slip by because states, for their own parochial interests, just cannot make it to the mark. I finish by once again reminding the Leader of the Opposition that he can play a national role by encouraging his state Liberal colleagues to sign up in Canberra.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. Firstly, I want to acknowledge the role that has been played by the honourable member as chair of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. It is an important role and that is why I have taken the opportunity today to say something about the discussion paper that was published by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That discussion paper, in the main, is a paper which will be considered and will draw comment in the normal course. But a couple of elements of it need to be responded to immediately because they have drawn some public attention and, I think, some legitimate concern. There is a remark in the discussion paper that the over-secretiveness in law enforcement actually promotes organised crime in Australia, and I reject that entirely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be abundantly clear that some form of secretiveness is necessary for effective law enforcement. As a matter of common sense, I think members would understand that it is not appropriate to enable those who are the subject of investigation, suspects of a criminal investigation, to become aware of the nature of that investigation being conducted into possible misconduct on their part.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian law enforcement authorities obviously have to conduct investigations in an environment of secrecy where the suspect is not kept up to date with that investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is another point: those who may be the subjects of an investigation are entitled to have their own civil liberties respected. Inevitably, in the course of any investigation, investigators fall upon partial information and information which they assemble in due course&mdash;they are always working on best information to date. But it would be enormously prejudicial if imperfect and partially completed investigations were the subject of widespread discussion. Many individuals in our community would have their reputations tarnished, notwithstanding that, subsequently, they have been shown not to be the subject of any criminal misbehaviour or any misbehaviour whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is important, as the committee properly points out, that we do take the opportunity of involving the community in knowing what we are doing against organised crime. In that regard, a major report was published earlier this year, the Commonwealth's law enforcement arrangements review, which for the first time published in a very comprehensive way a major strategic assessment of the threats this community faces from local and overseas organised crime syndicates. That is a very welcome report and one which should be commended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the committee gets it wrong in that it says that that was a one-off exercise, and nothing could be further from the truth. The follow-on of that report has been the acceptance of the recommendation that we establish the Office of Strategic Crime Assessment. The Office of Strategic Crime Assessment will be charged with continually reviewing threats that emerge in the criminal environment that may cause danger to our Australian community. Those assessments will not be secret. Those assessments will be collated and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessment will prepare briefs for the attention of the Minister for Justice and an annual public report so that the community is aware of the nature of the change that occurs in the criminal environment which concerns all of us as members of this community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important, given that OSCA will draw together intelligence from international, Commonwealth, state and other law enforcement agencies in a comprehensive picture, that we are aware that some of the issues that must have been in the mind of the committee have already been taken on board by Commonwealth authorities and that our community, our government and our law enforcement agencies stand ready to combat whatever changed threatened environment emerges.</PARA>

The study sought to convey the view that Australia's taxes were the highest in relation to income tax. It is important to understand that the comparisons of taxes in that study are not comparing like with like, and consequently are quite misleading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians calculate their personal income tax liability against the scale of marginal tax rates, plus the additional 1.4 per cent Medicare levy. Most other OECD countries also impose some form of additional social security levy over and above the standard personal income tax rates, although generally at a much higher level than Australia's Medicare levy. As with Australia's Medicare levy, these social security levies are paid into the general revenue; the only difference, apart from generally being higher overseas, is that they are generally calculated and identified separately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in the United Kingdom, a worker looking at his or her pay slip will see one box showing the personal income tax liability and a separate box showing the compulsory national insurance contribution. The Ernst and Young study appears to have included the Medicare levy in its calculation of personal income tax liabilities in Australia, but excluded the equivalent social security contributions in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. The comparison it provides is, therefore, quite misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD, in its publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Revenue statistics of OECD member countries</EMPHASIS>, provides data for both taxes on personal income and employees' compulsory social security contributions.

In the OECD publication the category of taxes on personal income in 1992 has Australia at 11.7 per cent of GDP compared with 10.1 per cent in the United States, 10 per cent in the United Kingdom and 7.4 per cent in Japan.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this basis, when the full picture of taxes is taken into account it can be seen that taxable income in Australia is in fact lower than in the other countries in the Ernst and Young study. It remains the case that the total tax burden in Australia in 1992 was 28.5 per cent of GDP compared with the United States at 29.4 per cent, Japan at 29.4 per cent and the United Kingdom at 35.2 per cent. The OECD average against our 28.5 per cent was 38.8 per cent. So we are absolutely one of the lowest taxed developed countries in the world&mdash;virtually the lowest, apart from Turkey, and we all know the story there&mdash;and we will remain a low tax country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that, when the Leader of the Opposition was last Treasurer, government revenue as a proportion of total GDP was two per cent of GDP higher than it is today&mdash;that is Commonwealth taxes to Commonwealth revenue. Two per cent of GDP is $10 billion, or about $550 for every man, woman and child in Australia. That was the tax record of the now Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer. If we still had his tax levels applying in this country, we would be taxing every man, woman and child $550 more than we are currently doing. That is the reality.</PARA>

Yet we find out today that we have an environmental levy on the books and it is a `relatively small tax'. We cannot tell you what a relatively small tax is but perhaps it is a bit like the fringe benefits tax.

Not only do we find out today that there is a new tax coming but we find out today that old tax cuts are going&mdash;the old tax cuts that were legislated before the last election, due to come into effect on 1 January 1996. The Treasurer was asked today to give an unequivocal commitment that they are going to be introduced and he said, `No, I won't.' He says, `Don't say it's a broken promise that we are not going to introduce these income tax cuts on 1 January 1996; we are not going to introduce them and we are going to stick by our promises.'</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This character produced this set of analyses on the last budget&mdash;this great prophet, this know-all on the economy, this fellow who absolutely knows what to deliver at any point of time when he wakes up at 10 o'clock and rocks into work for his three or four hours a day, with the odd bit of reading. This chap who managed to come out with that analysis a couple of months later produced what was probably the appropriate response to it. He does not know that it was the appropriate response, because he knows nothing about the subject with which he was dealing. A couple of months later he produced The Things That Matter for the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). That contained 22 promises on spending arrangements, 14 promises of increasing spending, and 14 increasing tax cuts. If you had had a belief about the budget last year that there was no increase in business investment, that the growth figures in the budget were all wrong because they were going to be much lower, that there was going to be no improvement in employment, that was exactly the right response. If that was your sound belief, you ought to have been increasing expenditure and lowering taxes. So he got that right, but he did not know it.

The old boy would fight until the sun went down and then start fighting as the morning came around. You have been the greatest back-scuttler when it comes to politics, and the politics of the opposition, over the last year and a half. You have run from every fight. You have pushed everybody up front. You have understood&mdash;oddly enough&mdash;in your soul your true ignorance.

We have faster than anticipated business growth, slightly faster than anticipated growth in the economy overall and much faster than anticipated employment growth. Much of that comes from the sensible policies the government put in place, both at the time of the last budget and previously in relation to the recession. In terms of changes to expenditure, the only substantial difference between the last budget and the prior one was the positioning of the white paper. As the country is coming out of recession, that white paper is doing what has not been done for 20-odd years; that is, putting long-term unemployed people back to work.

The opposition has a strategy. The opposition strategy is to attempt to tease out any particular proposition, area of expenditure or taxation arrangement and say, `Well, are you intending to do something about that?' Of course, at the end of the day there will be&mdash;and this will be the case in any budget, even budgets where there are very substantial adjustments going on&mdash;vast areas of outlays in revenue that simply will not be touched.

On every budget, the position of the finance minister and the Treasurer will obviously be different from the outcome that is ultimately achieved.

John Howard was Treasurer of this country for five years so he has a record that is capable of analysis. He never went into the budget process without adjusting both the revenue and fiscal sides. One of the great things about having John Howard back as leader is that the chant you so love about taxes and l-a-w, law, is no longer a position with which you can morally continue.

After that performance of your then Treasurer, for all sorts of reasons in terms of controlling sensible fiscal policy he felt instantly inclined after the election campaign in 1977&mdash;when you could ring up for your tax cut&mdash;to withdraw the whole lot of tax cuts. Contrast that situation prior to the election campaign of John Howard's l-a-w, law, taxes with this government's l-a-w, law, taxes. They were not promises that John Howard was dealing with; they were law. The first tranche of our tax cuts was delivered early with a net result, to the advantage of taxpayers, of some $2 billion. The second tranche was set aside, in order to control sensible fiscal policy, for a period of time when it could be subsequently addressed. Those cuts will be addressed as far as this budget process is concerned. That is sensible fiscal management. </PARA>

When they asked, `But what about our jobs?' the answer was, `Oh, we'll give you the dole.' That is the arrogant attitude of this government&mdash;`We'll give you the dole.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ensured that those interest rate cuts came through as quickly as possible to reignite the economy. The opposition kept wanting to talk it down. All we repeatedly heard from the opposition was that there was going to be a double-dip recession. Of course, the opposition was wrong on that, just as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been wrong on business investment in this cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to the question of employment. Once again, the opposition was wrong on that. Looking at this year's budget process, in his review statement last week, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) clarified the nature of events, most of which are very good news concerning economic conditions today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we recognised that some adjustments had to be made because of the current account problem. So the government did a number of sensible things. First of all, it decided to have a considered look at all the outlays questions and then consider, as part of the cycle at the time of the May budget, what measures were needed on the revenue side to ensure that we brought the budget back into surplus by 1996-97&mdash;two years earlier than had been forecast at the time of the last budget&mdash;because of strong growth in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were still going to ensure strong and high levels of growth by Australian standards because we were getting such productivity gains flowing through the economy and continuing to surge through the economy because we were continuing to get the capital reinvestment that business investment was bringing. But it was also a reflection of the fact that since the three increases in official interest rates since August last year, there have been signs that the economy has started to respond to those interest rate rises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is better to make a sober assessment at the May budget of what other measures are needed because we do want to ensure that the economy keeps growing strongly. We need to ensure that we address the current account problem as we go along with that process&mdash;and those things can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures out last week relating to both retail sales and housing show that the economy has responded in those key areas. I suspect the next couple of lots of data that relate to other areas of the economy will also show that that slowing has occurred. As a result, the sort of hysteria that has been worked up on the current account is one to which we do not need to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) probably got the Deputy Leader of the Opposition right about his approach to economic issues. But it is not just about sloganising in the way we have seen here today; it is about responsibly addressing the economic needs of the nation. And that is precisely what the government is doing with its approach to the forthcoming May budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said before I was interrupted for question time, there are two amendments in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1994 affecting personal taxation. Part 2 implements social security changes that amend the income tax law so that payments of disability wage supplement, DWS, are given similar tax treatment to comparable social security payments. The DWS was a 1993-94 budget measure which began on 1 July 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DWS will be exempt from income tax for those recipients under pension age. The DWS for recipients above pension age will be taxable, but they will be eligible for a beneficiary rebate which will negate the tax on the DWS for a full rate recipient. Additionally, bereavement payments related to the DWS will be given similar tax treatment to bereavement payments attaching to the disability support pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Technical amendments are also made to the tax treatment of other social security payments. Deductibility of gifts is also dealt with in the bill, this time in part 6. There the bill extends the list of charitable organisations for which gifts of $2 or more are tax deductible. Only two of those organisations will have no time limits set as to how long the deductions will be available. Another three have had deadlines set and will expire on 3 April 1996, 24 April 1996 and 16 June 1996. Deductions became available for all of those organisations or charitable institutions named over the period 4 April 1994 to 27 October 1994 inclusive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four amendments which deal with tax administration matters, including the creation of a tax ombudsman. Part 1 of schedule 2 ensures that taxpayers will not be subject to administrative penalty under any penalty provision for an act or omission for which the taxpayer is being prosecuted. The amendment also widens the range of offences where administrative penalties are not payable or must be refunded where a prosecution is instituted. These two measures were announced in an information paper in November 1991 entitled `Improvements to self assessment&mdash;priority tasks'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also removes the power of the Commissioner of Taxation to impose or reimpose an administrative penalty where a prosecution is withdrawn. This measure implements recommendation 130 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report No. 326. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes are made to the notice on rulings in division 1, part 3 of schedule 2. Currently the legislation provides that a ruling is made when it is published. The term is not defined, however, and the requirements for publication remain uncertain. The bill aims to remove uncertainty about when a public ruling is effectively made. It provides that a public ruling is made when published and notice of the ruling is published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. Accordingly, a rule in future will not take full effect until it has been published and gazetted. In addition, if the commissioner withdraws a public ruling, notice of the withdrawal must be published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. This measure implements recommendations 32 and 33 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 2 of the same part gives the Commissioner of Taxation the ability to round down to the nearest multiple of 5c the final amount of a taxation liability due and payable under any act or regulation which the commissioner administers. However, refunds will not be rounded down since they can be negotiated through a payee's bank account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 of schedule 2 allows the Commonwealth Ombudsman, if he or she chooses when performing his or her reviews and investigations of the administrative functions of the Australian Taxation Office, to be known as the Taxation Ombudsman. In effect, the amendment is intended to establish a Taxation Ombudsman within the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. This amendment is based on recommendations 132 to 136 inclusive of the JCPA report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An assessment of tax</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has rejected the establishment of the Taxation Ombudsman position as a statutory position. The coalition, I remind the House, supports the ombudsman's position being a statutory position operating as a distinct office and working within the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation made in the report was recommendation 131, which canvassed the establishment of a taxpayers' charter. The government claims to support a charter, though to be effective it should be given a legislative basis so it has a real ability to protect the rights of taxpayers. The charter should be widely circulated to achieve widespread support. It should avoid at all costs</PARA>
<PARA>becoming a document that does little to enforce the rights of taxpayers. It should not become the be-all and end-all of taxpayers' rights, with the ATO ducking rights and responsibilities not specifically mentioned in the charter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government deserves to be condemned for dragging the chain on the fringe benefits compliance review. The review announced in the 1994 budget is now eight months overdue. Two months ago, the office of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) stated that the review would be released in the next few weeks. Where is it? The review is of central importance to the business community, which is burdened by high compliance costs associated with the fringe benefits tax. Both the professional bodies and the business community are frustrated by the government's inertia on this issue. Its lack of immediate action can only be interpreted as a demonstration that the government is not committed to the review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also widespread confusion on the scope of the review. On 3 October 1994, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, the Australian Taxation Office signalled that the review of FBT would result in significant reductions in compliance costs for business. Then on 29 October 1994, again reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, the Treasurer urged caution amongst business groups because the promised review would not result in any significant concessions. Hence there will be little, if any, reduction in the cost of compliance. Naturally enough, related closely to the issue of tax law amendments is the actual amount of taxes collected by the government.

When they complain about the level of personal tax when it has increased by 73 per cent in real terms, those opposite should go along to the chippie and say, `As a percentage of GDP, your taxes are really down one or two per cent.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to have been elected the member for Kooyong, and I thank the people of Kooyong and the Liberal Party for their support. Kooyong has made history on a number of occasions. In 1994 it again made history by being the first electorate to ever vote into the House of Representatives an Australian of Greek birth. The Kooyong preselection and by-election send a clear message that the Liberal Party is open to all and represents the interests of every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Federation, Kooyong has returned only six members to the federal parliament. Sir Robert Menzies and Andrew Peacock represented Kooyong for 60 years. Last year, 1994, was filled with homage to Sir Robert Menzies. He was a towering figure, a creator and a very tough politician. He brought together the Liberal Party, and no mean feat kept it together. He led the coalition to victory on seven consecutive occasions and governed Australia with vision and integrity during a period of remarkable growth and prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I met Menzies only once in his retirement but I worked with his successor&mdash;my predecessor, Andrew Peacock&mdash;for almost two decades. As Minister for External Territories, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the Opposition, Andrew Peacock made a truly distinguished contribution to Australia. Andrew Peacock would have been an outstanding Prime Minister if the vagaries of the electoral system and our party's organisational deficiencies had not denied him that opportunity in 1990. I am sure all members of this House join me in wishing Andrew every success and happiness in his post-political life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last decade under Labor, this nation has endured a pounding unprecedented in our postwar history. Australians have been subjected to economic trauma, to wide-ranging social change, to broken promises and to hopes raised repeatedly only to be dashed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our national debt is huge and growing. Our current account is in crisis. Our standard of living, relative to the rest of the world and our region, has dramatically declined. Our unemployment is massive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's people, its businesses, its farmers and its economy are daily being hurt by Labor's deliberate policy of interest rate increases. The economic indicators, stark as they are, give us only a very crude insight into the social costs of Labor governments: a growing gap between rich and poor; family breakdown; youth homelessness; and a public mood which in recent years has been dominated by a sense of overload, despondency, a lack of control over the future; and an intensification of cynicism and a loss of faith in government institutions. Nothing has done more to increase cynicism towards government than the words and deeds of the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating). If anyone has ripped and torn at the Australian body politic, Paul Keating is the guilty party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Australian people have become utterly cynical about this government does not mean that they have turned into believers in the invisible hand. The old certainties may have vanished and the old syndrome of automatic dependence and trust in government may have weakened dramatically, but the belief that government has a fundamental responsibility for securing the nation's welfare is still profound. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians no longer assume that government will act with commonsense, intelligence or vision, but they continue to demand that government behaves in such ways and they demand more participation in decisions and in outcomes. They will punish governments that fail to meet their expectations. It is the responsibility of this parliament to creatively respond to Australians and to mobilise their potential, to strengthen the wellbeing of our country, and to give a sense of national direction and purpose. This is what the Australian people want and this is what we are obliged to provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are differences between the parties on the role of government and these are often crystallised in the terms of big government versus small government. Important as these labels may be to us, Australians judge governments by performance, by outcomes and by results. What Australians want is effective government, balanced government, efficient government, and intelligent government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The requirements of government, as we approach the end of this century, are complex, but some of the key ones can be encapsulated in three imperatives. Government must firstly put its own house in order; secondly, it must use its commonsense; and thirdly, it must recognise that success is possible but is always fragile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first imperative for a government which seeks to put itself in a position of leadership is to put its own house in order. Never before has the need for government to ensure that its own operations are effective and efficient been so urgent. Australia is faced by intense pressure to become more cost-effective, dynamic and productive in an increasingly difficult international environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government has subjected the private sector to massive dislocations and social change and to a barrage of exhortations about the need for private enterprise to become more competitive. This very government is plagued by&mdash;to use a phrase that recurs in Australian politics&mdash;duplication and overlap in its own structures and operations. Government assistance to firms, designed to improve their competitiveness, is a revealing case in point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After reams of rhetoric about the private sector's need to pick up its game, the government became concerned about the coordination&mdash;another well-used phrase&mdash;of its own programs and called for an urgent report. The report by Mr Ian Burgess was made available in December 1994. It covered 23 programs expending some $555 million, administered by five departments and authorities, and concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An outcome of program overlap and current delivery arrangements is that the same enterprise can receive assistance from a number of agencies. Often there is little or no planning and coordination across agencies. As a result . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to say that enterprises are not necessarily receiving the assistance they most need; some are likely to receive more financial assistance than is sensible; and some firms being `tempted' away from one source of assistance by a better offer from a different agency and program shopping. His conclusion overall is remarkably moderate. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of these outcomes will reduce the effectiveness of Government expenditure on enterprise improve ment.</PARA>
<PARA>This is in an area where the government is exhorting everyone else. The business of government is complex&mdash;some degree of duplication and overlap is inevitable. Nothing excuses the current situation. The duplication and overlap that occurs within the Commonwealth sphere is only part of a massive problem where Commonwealth and state programs and administrations interact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Examine any substantive policy area and what you will find looks more like a set of intestines than a rational allocation of financial, policy and administrative responsibilities. The cost of this overlap and duplication has never been calculated, but it is clearly huge. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not a dazzling new revelation. Mr Hawke made reforming federal-state relations a key item on his policy agenda. The present Prime Minister for his part made opposing reform a pawn in his pursuit of Bob's job, and there is little sign of any positive movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states are not going to vanish. The federal government can try to override the states. The states will resist. The outcome will be increased duplication and overlap as the various sovereign state and federal governments settle into protracted administrative guerrilla warfare. Institutional mechanisms will not resolve the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is required is the rebuilding of trust between the states and Commonwealth. Trust, as we know all too well, is a precious commodity in politics: it is difficult to acquire and it is easily squandered. Trust is not built by a Prime Minister who declares that there is legitimate reason to reduce tied grants and then increases them year by year; who consistently uses the external affairs power to override the states; and who demands that the states embrace competition policy, but shields the federal government from many of its impacts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people are simply fed up with costly federal-state conflict. They are not as worried as they once were about jurisdictional issues. What they want is an end to waste and inefficiency and the transparent shifting of blame between federal and state governments. They want a creative and cooperative resolution of common problems. If the federal government wants to put its house in order it needs a constructive act of leadership on the part of its chief minister. Unfortunately, the present Prime Minister has demonstrated all too often that he is too committed to conflict, short-term political conquests and the desire for dominance to achieve a conciliatory bipartisan approach which serves the interests of the whole nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second imperative of good government is the application of commonsense. Governments are usually faced by complex situations, but there are cases where solutions are comparatively straightforward. Today our medical system is sick. Hospital Medicare now requires commonsense policy intervention to restore it to health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Blewett, who introduced Medicare in 1983, consistently maintained:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare's continued success and high popularity is dependent upon the maintenance of a strong, viable private health care sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today Dr Blewett's historical commentary haunts this government. Between 1984 and early 1990 the number of Australians with private health insurance declined from approximately 50 per cent to 44.5 per cent. The impact of this quite significant decline was moderated in the first instance by the fact that over two million people took out supplementary  table insurance. It was a shift from basic to supplementary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1990, however, the position has dramatically reversed. The number of insured Australians has fallen by over a million, over 700,000 of whom previously held supplementary table insurance. All these people previously used private hospitals if hospitalisation was required. All now rely solely on the public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister takes the line that this is not an immediate problem because the people dropping out are mostly `the young and the healthy'. The fact is, it is simply not credible that over a million Australians are so healthy they never require hospitalisation. With unemployment hovering at around nine per cent, with disposable income being hit by interest rate increases, and with the cost of comprehensive health insurance being between $1,500 and $2,000, many ordinary Australians, including those who get sick, simply cannot afford to insure their health or that of their families. They want to insure, as any number of studies shows, but they cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no point in repeating that old furphy that health insurance is the province of the rich and wealthy. That is simply not true. Pensioners, people on below average weekly earnings, families&mdash;all would like to be dependent on private health insurance. The fact is that those who want to keep or take up hospital insurance deserve government support through health insurance premium rebates or subsidies or similar devices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not just a matter of need; it is also a matter of rationality. If the 700,000 Australians who let health insurance lapse since 1990 access public hospitals at the average rate of Australians overall, the drain on the public purse will be about $495 million per annum. If immediate remedial action is not taken, the outcome is clear: we will have a non-viable private hospital and private health insurance system, a public system collapsing under the weight of burgeoning waiting lists, and an unacceptable financial drain on governments and taxpayers. Commonsense requires that the government act now; experience indicates that this government will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third imperative for government is to recognise that it can succeed, even on the most sensitive issues, so long as it responds to reality, and proceeds with prudence and creativity. Multiculturalism is such a success. I am proud to be a member of the party which enthusiastically implemented the mass immigration program of the 1950s and liberalised Australia's discriminatory policy. I am proud to be a member of the party which carries on the tradition of the Fraser government, which honoured its moral obligations towards Vietnamese and Indo-Chinese refugees. I am proud to be a member of a party and to have been an adviser to the government which created Australia's watershed in multicultural philosophy and practice&mdash;the Galbally report&mdash;and which established multicultural television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Liberals can all take great pride in the Fraser government's courage in replacing discredited assimilationism with the recognition that national cohesion is best attained through accepting and endorsing diversity within the framework of shared, fundamental Australian values. Over the last half century, Australia has become a home, and a nation, for five million immigrants from over 130 countries. Almost 40 per cent of our population are either immigrants or the children of immigrants, and almost half of those are either immigrants from non-English speaking backgrounds, or the children of immigrants from non-English speaking backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Advanced by successive governments for almost a quarter of a century, multiculturalism involves: the recognition of the indisputable fact that immigration has diversified Australia's ethnic composition; and the implementation of policies maximising the skills and assets inherent in this diversity for the benefit of the individual and for our society as a whole. Multiculturalism involves the right of all Australians to express and share their individual cultural heritage, the right to equality of treatment and opportunity and the removal of discriminatory barriers. It also involves the key obligation to make an unreserved commitment to Australia and Australia's interests, to the basic structures and principles of Australian society&mdash;the constitution and rule of law, parliamentary democracy, tolerance and equality, freedom of speech and religion, and English as the national language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence shows that migrants and ethnic communities are committed and loyal to a country that affords them respect and freedom. Inter-ethnic tensions have been the exceptions rather than the rule. Given the intensity of feeling on many issues, the record in this country is remarkably unblemished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite unrealistic and unfair to expect migrant or ethnic communities to be disinterested in developments in their countries of origin. That they should feel passionate, emotional and committed is to be expected; that they can pursue their interests in the framework of a democratic society is their entitlement, so long as this is done in ways which respect the rights of others and which are peaceful and non-violent. Overwhelmingly, to the great credit of Australia's ethnic groups and to the great credit of our system, this has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Out of the mass immigration of the last half century has emerged an admirable, decent, harmonious multicultural Australia, a society based on the appreciation of cultural diversity and on tolerance and mutual respect. Despite confusions, criticisms and shortcomings, multiculturalism is one of our country's important achievements. Multiculturalism has enriched Australian life and self-esteem, and enhanced the inherent fairness, decency and attractiveness of Australian society. In a world of ethnic conflict and violence, it has impressed other nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, while multiculturalism has been a fundamental policy and a social success there are still elements of ambivalence about it in our society. The fact is that successful policies do not sustain themselves; they have to be sustained. It is incumbent on all of us to recognise that success is always fragile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I first sat on the floor of this House as an adviser in October 1975&mdash;at a time when the Labor government was rather more relaxed about demonstrations&mdash;and I worked for Malcolm Fraser in government for almost five years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. I again congratulate the new member for Kooyong on his fine speech. I predict a long term in this parliament for him. Today the parliament is debating Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1994. I know that my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who is in the chair, has made a resounding opening speech on behalf of the coalition; I will not reflect on his views whilst he is in the chair, except to say that the member for Curtin is another very fine member of the parliament; and he spoke brilliantly on this taxation measure. He has moved, on behalf of the coalition, an amendment to the second reading as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)condemns the Government for the ever burgeoning level of taxation since 1983, which has increased by more than double the rate of inflation; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)deplores the high and growing cost to taxpayers of complying with an increasingly complex tax system".</PARA>
<PARA>If we are to take any note of the newspapers and the answers presented by ministers in question time, we could not but agree with the inferences of the amendment moved by the member for Curtin. The complexity of the taxation system has been brought to the attention of this House. The government is going through what it calls a simplification process of tax law. Shortly, this House will debate another measure&mdash;I believe it is called the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill&mdash;which seeks to simplify the language of the tax act. That simplification process runs into 64 pages. Leaving that aside, it does somewhat simplify the understanding of the tax act but it does not simplify the administration of it or the onerous requirements of the tax office upon taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the chief objections of the community to the changes this government has made since 1983 is the complexity of the tax act, which gives no attention to the cost of compliance. The complexity, with no care for the cost of compliance to taxpayers, means that a taxpayer can be put to a huge cost in the time wasting processes of preparing for the requirements of the tax office. The Treasury, the tax office and the government do not care what that cost is&mdash;it is irrelevant. All they do is see how much money they want to raise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the other area of our complaint. The government has kept lifting taxation year after year. Its spending has increased at twice the rate of inflation. If a normal household were to adopt this practice, we would have the wage earner bringing home his wages each week, roughly increasing at the rate of inflation over a period of time, with the household spending roughly double that increase each year. That is a disastrous process of management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To see that the government has an external credit rating of only AA instead of AAA indicates what the rest of the world thinks of Australian management. The government is not prepared to tackle its big spending preferences. I would like to refer the House to the statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) just prior to Christmas when he paid out in substantial measure on managers and the heads of large businesses around Australia, encouraging them to better manage their businesses, to get their act into gear and to get their salaries and wages down. The Prime Minister, despite that payout to the private sector, has never taken one word of his own advice on the management of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is the biggest spending government the nation has ever seen. There are constant increases in taxation and, despite the carping of the Treasurer (Mr Willis), we have an Australian accounting firm demonstrating clearly, for the whole nation to see, that Australians are the highest taxed individuals of comparable countries and that the complaint of Australian people and families is justified when they look at what they pay out to this government; it is increasing year after year. The carping of the Treasurer cannot hide the fact that the Prime Minister's advice to business and to all and sundry is never followed by his own ministers, or by him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister constantly wants to grab more money from superannuation funds. It is no wonder that savings in Australia are at the lowest we have seen and that Australians do not want to save. These low saving levels in Australia indicate that people do not trust the future. They are not prepared to have any faith in what might happen next year or the year after. They know that down the track, in three or four months time, there is likely to be a budget which will change all of their savings plans. It does not matter how long they may have been preparing for retirement, to buy a house or for anything else, this government is completely unconscious of them when it comes to making decisions. All it is anxious to do is to lift the grab from the Australian people. It does not care how complex that grab process is or how much pain it imposes on the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), who is at the table, would obviously be more at home in a stage production of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The King and I</EMPHASIS> than he would be here in this parliament because he does not understand the tax act or the processes of what the government is doing to Australian families. So he might as well go on the road and go into a stage production of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The King and I</EMPHASIS>. He is eminently suited to it. I have not heard him sing; but he looks fine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer and the Prime Minister dismiss those processes. The magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Decisions</EMPHASIS>, presented by the National Australia Bank, contains a report of an interview from October last year between the Managing Director of the bank, Don Argus, and Ralph Willis, the Treasurer. A couple of really important questions are asked by Don Argus in that interview only three or four months ago. The Treasurer makes some statements in response to questions from Argus. Argus said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've just returned from Singapore and Hong Kong, and the theme that's emerged in all the offshore trips I do is that there's still some uneasiness about the management of our fiscal policy. You have half-answered the question already, but is there room for acceleration in some fiscal and monetary policy measures?</PARA>
<PARA>Ralph Willis responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have built in a deficit reduction strategy over the next few years, based on the policies as they were at the time of the last Budget. This will pull the Budget deficit down by almost 3% of GDP over the period from 1993/94 to 1997/98, which is quite a substantial reduction.</PARA>
<PARA>Within a few weeks the Treasurer, shamefaced, has to come into the House and announce that that deficit reduction program has blown out of the water and, in fact, that the deficit has escalated by something like 40 per cent. So all the plans he was talking about late last year are shot to pieces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the Prime Minister saying to business, `Get your act into gear,' but refusing to do it himself; and we have a Treasurer who is saying that everything is under control and he has a scheme to reduce the deficit, balance the budget and go into surplus over a period of three years&mdash;so everything in the garden is lovely. Talk about self-delusion amongst members of the government, particularly senior ministers! The interview with Don Argus of the National Bank only three or four months ago goes on with Argus asking another question of Willis:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been a suggestion that some of the gyrations in long-term bond rates were a message to the market that perhaps we should be looking at fiscal policy adjustment a little earlier than we have been. Does that concern you?</PARA>
<PARA>Willis answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly, when our long-term bond rates went up a little more than most other major players, it was of some concern&mdash;and it was disappointing, no doubt about that. It was somewhat perplexing, given the low level of inflation and inflation expectations.</PARA>
<PARA>What the market was showing was that it wanted Australian governments to take control of their spending. Now there is a panic, running into the May budget, about what the government is going to cut. What health programs, education programs, social welfare programs and children's services programs is the government going to cut to reduce its expenditure?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I predict that the government will use a combination of a reduction of expenditure and an increase in taxation. It will try to minimise the pain by taking money away from people it would normally give money to; and it will try to minimise the pain of those people it is going to grab money from in a fresh tax grab. It will be a double whammy; some reduction in government expenditure in its programs and some increase in taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his interview with Don Argus of the National Bank, Ralph Willis talks about savings. It is very interesting to look at the attitude of the government and the Treasurer towards savings, because if anything is really deficient in Australia it is an incentive and an ethos of saving. Don Argus asked the Treasurer the question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With a strengthening economy and, at last, signs that business investment is recovering, the focus of financial markets inevitably gets back to the savings/investment gap and external debt levels:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What, realistically, can be done to encourage some private savings?</PARA>
<PARA>Ralph Willis says, basically, `I'm pleased you asked that question. We've got superannuation.' That is the only answer he can provide. In a modern economy, that is not a good enough answer, that the government is providing some scope for superannuation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;High tax policies. The motion moved by the member for Curtin condemns the government for its ever burgeoning level of taxation and deplores the high and growing cost to taxpayers of complying with the tax grab.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) extends that grab in some areas. The main provisions deal with life assurance companies; bonus shares; the disability support payments, and how that will be dealt with; and the natural increase in livestock. Every farmer now has to go out with a stock and station agent and value every calf on 30 June to make sure that they are all right. I do not know how that applies to large pastoral areas. I guess an estimate is made. No doubt there is a tax ruling on that measure which has not passed this parliament. The Commissioner of Taxation thinks that the range riders of Canberra, and the people who are well versed in pastoral pursuits that go to work in suits each day in this city, are able to give him advice on the valuation of livestock in remote areas. But that must occur, according to the legislation that we are passing here in this House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill includes the eligibility for insurance business income, the taxing processes of the Bank of New South Wales, company tax instalments and how they are dealt with&mdash;that is interesting reading&mdash;and the ombudsman being able to call himself the Taxation Ombudsman. We are going to deal with far more substantial acts of taxation in the days to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the House to the massive and growing complexity of the tax system, where the government itself has sought to chase every dollar. In particular, under the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax provisions and a multiplicity of other tax processes, the government has been seeking to maximise its income, no matter what the cost to the Australian consumer, the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FBT legislation has created ludicrous examples. The government is going through the simplification process of the taxation laws, yet there is still nothing on the deck about the fringe benefits tax to which the business community can look for substantiation and compliance. The government is still worried about parking lots, whether their mobile phones and laptop computers are taxable, and all of the other stupidities that are in the fringe benefits tax for which the taxpayers are liable. Eight months after the review process, the government is taking no action to change that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into further details of the stupidity. I have a paper prepared by the State Chamber of Commerce of New South Wales which lists some of the ridiculous activities that the taxpayer has to go through to meet the requirements of the tax office. One example is a door manufacturing company based at Rockdale which decided to relocate its facilities to St Marys, 60 kilometres from Rockdale. To assist employees to make the transition to St Marys, the company paid for the relocation costs of the employees, such as removal expenditure. These expenses were defined to be within the FBT net as the relocation was not interstate. How absolutely stupid.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Assistant Treasurer comes in here every day and tries to defend this situation. The Prime Minister tells private enterprise to get its act into gear whilst it pursues such ludicrous policies as those. I refer to the growing concern in the community as to how the capital gains tax is threatening family estates. It has been in position now for long enough that the inheritors of an estate will be paying capital gains tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way it works, as I understand it, is that if I leave something to my children and then they either leave something to their children or gift it away a capital gains tax is paid on that process. The complexity of the calculation defies imagination. Most accountants seek legal opinions before they give advice in capital gains tax areas at a minimal cost of $5,000 per client. But that is a compliance cost that does not worry the government or anybody else designing tax laws. They do not care as long as the money comes in. Whilst the stupidity of spendthrift attitudes of this government are maintained, nobody worries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This long-term process of simplification has bogged down. In my estimation, at the rate we are going we will finish the process of simplification of the tax act on a page count basis by the year 2015. In 2015, the parliament will be presented with the last few pages of the revised tax act, by which time the first attempts, which will be dated 1995, will be 20 years out of date. That is a wonderful process of progressive administration and government management. I challenge the Treasurer to demonstrate that that is not a fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the whole regime of this government in regard to the Australian population is cruel and ludicrous. I draw to the attention of the government the business fears of tax rises and interest rate rises, which are recorded in survey after survey; and the preference of the Australian people for the government to cut its own expenditure rather than to increase taxes. I trust there will be a reducing number of occasions on which we will come into the House to debate taxation law, because the Australian people want to be relieved of taxation; they want the process simplified and the cost of compliance reduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am obliged to members of the Australian Labor Party for coming in to listen to this debate. Not one of them is on the list of speakers on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1994. One wonders how disgusted they are with the bill when they feel the necessity to stay away from the chamber altogether and be called to account only by way of a quorum. So I thank my colleague at the table, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne), for bringing them in. But it is a bit disappointing to see that they are now leaving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not surprised that there is no government speaker on this bill. The government must be terribly embarrassed about the manner in which the tax debate in this country is going at the moment. If I were part of the government and I had a bill like this in front of me I would go away too. During the second reading debate on this bill the government has foreshadowed that it already has 10 amendments to be moved to it at a later time. That shows the lack of consideration that has been given to the whole policy area and to the writing of the legislation. I believe that this is not the first time this has happened. It is par for the course for the Labor government to give no consideration to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in my mind that over the last 12 years the Labor Party has established itself in this country as the master of high taxation, not only in the increases in taxation but also in the implementation of new taxes over that time. It is rather interesting to note that in question time today we were told that there will be a small tax coming in on top of a lot of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the Treasurer (Mr Willis), today particularly, demonstrated his mastership and manipulation of statistics. I am reminded of the old call, `there are lies, damned lies and statistics'. This whole debate is attached to a set of statistics that is set up by the government to record its situation in the most favourable light. I will take up two comments that are already on record&mdash;your own comments, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, and the comments last week of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). He went to the trouble in an MPI of disproving the ridiculous statements that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) are making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He averaged certain increases over the period of the Fraser government from 1975 to 1983 and then averaged similar increases from 1983 to 1994. What he came up with was that the average in tax revenues under the years of the Fraser coalition government was 22.9 per cent of GDP&mdash;and under Labor since 1983 it has reached 24 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now mention some of your own figures, Mr Deputy Speaker, which are pertinent. Since 1983 under Labor, taxation on individuals has gone up by 136.8 per cent; company tax has gone up by a whopping 305.4 per cent; sales tax, the hidden tax, has gone up by 219.56 per cent; and total indirect tax has gone up by 153.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting feature about those statistics is that in that time inflation has risen by 63.6 per cent&mdash;less than half of the increase in taxation. Government members come in here and talk about statistics and low taxation under this government despite a chartered accountancy firm's own comparison across the board. If I were the Treasurer, I would be embarrassed to be here at the table. But I remind the Treasurer that this is his bill. He should be at the table and taking notice of the comments that are being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later in this debate I will point out some real issues affecting the tax debate that have not been addressed. The real problem is that the government is not listening&mdash;much the same thing happened in the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994 last week. What we will also find is that this government has not only increased taxation and the number of taxes but also managed to accelerate the collection of taxes from the time the Fraser government was in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, company taxation was always collected on a year in arrears basis. Companies are now taxed as an interim measure one month after company profits are determined. The government has also accelerated quite considerably the collection of prescribed payments tax&mdash;going by your figures, Mr Deputy Speaker. The collection of all these taxes has come to a point where the government has taken the last ounce in tax, made the tax payable immediately and then looked around for fresh sources. There is no doubt that the government is the merchant of high taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the sermon during the church service at the start of this parliamentary term, I was able to connect the Prime Minister to the phrase: give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, pay him his tribute; and give unto God that which is God's. Caesar&mdash;Keating&mdash;is taking more than his share of the tribute as far as Caesar is concerned; he is taking over the limit. I have a feeling that if he has not established himself as God already, he believes he is also taking God's share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the real rorts that nobody speaks about in this place is the untaxed income of the trade union movement across Australia. I know immediately that the call will be, `That is okay, but the other associations also have an exempt status.' But the amounts of assets involved on both sides of the ledger are not comparable. The trade union movement is getting a tax-free ride at the expense of every other taxpayer out there&mdash;those who will face this tax rise within the next six months. It is then able to contribute to the coffers of the Labor Party at election time because of those tax-free profits. That is something that should be brought to the attention of the people of Australia&mdash;the honest taxpayers&mdash;to let them know why they are paying the extra taxes. This should be high on the agenda of any government that is looking for equity in the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now explain not only the increases in the old taxes, as have been evidenced from the list, but also the new taxes&mdash;taxes that we said we would never have. The capital gains tax provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act&mdash;a mammoth document&mdash;are subject to change under this legislation and its amendments. The tax started on a small scale but has become a real windfall for the government. With the fringe benefits tax the government has gone out deliberately to tax the business sector of this country, and is now taxing fringe benefits that are not actually fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like some of the taxation people and some of the government people to go out to some of these isolated minefields and isolated pastoral properties to find out whether having a house in such places should be regarded as a fringe benefit; whether having an airconditioning unit in your house when the heat is up to 50 degrees celsius should be regarded as a fringe benefit; and whether taking your kids from the mine site to the nearest town so that they can get an education should be regarded as a fringe benefit. Again, we have a fringe benefit device which the Treasurer said at the last budget was going to be subject to some compliance alterations so it would not be so complicated. However, nothing has been done. We should be critical of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention the Medicare levy. I have already talked about the prescribed payments tax, which has been introduced to accelerate collection. There is a taxation on employers to contribute to superannuation funds. The amendment mentions the high cost of compliance and substantiation under this government's tax system. I have no problems with the proposition that people who earn income should legitimately pay taxation on it. The complaint that I hear from businesses and taxpayers in my electorate is about the cost of compliance in terms of time&mdash;not only in the case of income tax and company tax, but also all these other elements; it is fast becoming a burden which they cannot stand. Substantiation on top of that contravenes the common laws of justice in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in new taxes and the increases in the taxes that are being implemented at the moment are cancerous in their nature. I do not say that with any malice aforethought. The Treasurer said today that there will be a small tax. We know that small taxes grow like cancers. Like cancer, they have the capacity to kill off business, to kill off the incentive that is necessary to survive in a system like ours. Yet this government is running full pelt towards an increase in taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to look across the Tasman, we would see in New Zealand an economy that has adopted a goods and services tax, a value added tax. New Zealand has reduced individual taxation and company rates of taxation. At the moment, New Zealand is out-performing Australia in leaps and bounds. Its current account is in credit whereas, as we know from last week, ours is going further and further into debt. We have to understand that a high taxing country is a disincentive for people, a disincentive on businesses, and an encouragement to so many others to enter into competition with us because we cannot afford those taxes, particularly those of an indirect nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to admit that nobody in this country understands the government and, in particular, nobody understands the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), who is at the table. He is part of a collection of people who have no consideration for those outside this place. It is okay for us in this enclave; we have guaranteed pay increases and all the benefits of the system. But when you go out there, you have to fight on a daily basis for survival, for competition in business. The minister would do well to go into his electorate and open his eyes to see what is going on in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the increase in the average levels of taxation. If you look at the record, you will see that those increases in taxation lead to increases in expenditure and in the whole realm. Today in this place we talked about savings. It is of no surprise that savings have diminished, because people are so busy paying money into the taxation pool. It is of no surprise that we have a record current account deficit, and all those other things that are associated with high taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia must be wondering about this situation as they approach the next election. We put our taxes on the table at the last election. The Labor government implemented its taxes by way of l-a-w, law. In the first moment after the election, that law turned into an l-i-e, lie. The government has to face the people on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now hear that there will be a three per cent increase in superannuation for employees. It does not matter how much the government denies these things by saying, `There will not be carbon tax; there will not be superannuation on employees; there will not be a child-care rebate adjustment; there will not be a wealth tax.' It does not matter how much the government insists that these measures are not on the agenda. If you want to believe the Labor government, at the next election it will be fair to ask it where it stands in relation to these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People out in the community are scared stiff of a wealth tax. We got rid of that and opened up a lot of avenues for people in Australia to go out and invest. Are we going to have a wealth tax? Are we going to have a carbon tax? Are we going to defer this three per cent for now and put it on later? We have to ask people to come clean. We said we were going to have a taxation act with clear English expression and clear and concise rules. As my colleague mentioned before, by the year 2005 they might have been able to go through the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give honourable members one example of how extravagant we are with our regulation. The act covering the fringe benefits tax which was implemented in New Zealand and which was a model for the one we took comprises about 150 or 160 pages. The act covering our fringe benefits tax runs into something like 400 or 500 pages, and it still has to be amended by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter I wish to mention relates to the unfairness of the sales tax. That was particularly borne out in evidence given to the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration when it investigated the tax impact on the tourist industry. People in my electorate and people right around Australia are discriminated against because the vehicles they use are required to carry up to 12 passengers. If a vessel or a minibus is not capable of carrying up to 12 passengers, sales tax at the rate of 21 per cent is imposed, not only on the new item but also on the spares and things like that. I understand that rate will shortly go up by one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These types of anomalies cannot be fixed by bandaid measures. There is only one way to do it. All of the indirect taxes imposed on business should be cleared right out of the system. I hope that the representations made by people in the Whitsundays in my electorate are taken into account by the Treasurer and the government to make sure that the anomaly that exists between a 12-plus exemption as against a 12-minus full payment of the tax is fully examined. I will be looking at the report in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter I mention relates to the Access to Justice Advisory Committee, which looked into the tax deductibility of expenses incurred in litigation in this country. From my experience, it is not worth while for an ordinary citizen to take action against a big company&mdash;particularly a finance company or a bank&mdash;because the deductibility of the expenses of ordinary citizens is nil, whereas the deductibility of the expenses of big companies is unlimited. I have recently observed the abuse of the system by some financial institutions in legal action against former clients. In some cases, financial institutions are paying more than a million dollars in legal expenses. How can an ordinary person get justice under that system? The Access to Justice Advisory Committee took this into account in part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under section 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act, there is an entitlement to deduct from assessable income all losses and outgoings to the extent that they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income. Of course, a financial institution is doing just that&mdash;producing assessable income. Paragraph 8.8 of the committee's report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Law Society Task Force criticised tax deductibility of legal expenses in litigation for creating an incentive for business to litigate rather than use alternative dispute resolution.</PARA>
<PARA>This is particularly the case with the banks at the moment in mediating on the forex deals&mdash;the foreign exchange deals. The report further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Discussion Paper also noted the inequity between the business litigant and the individual, where one can rely on tax deductions and the other cannot.</PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is an argument that tax deductibility creates inequities between business and private litigants.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is obvious. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The equity argument essentially rests on the financial imbalance between a business and a private litigant. The former is usually entitled to deduct the litigation costs. Thus, in a sense, the general body of taxpayers is subsidising the business litigant's decision to litigate . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Of course the individual has to pay the full cost, and there is no subsidy. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By contrast, the private litigant must bear the full costs of the litigation including court costs, unless he or she recovers costs from the opposing party in the proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>The barb is that, if litigants go the full distance and lose the case, they are normally associated with the cost of the litigation on the other side. The paper continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deductibility of the business litigant's legal expenses may, therefore, accentuate imbalances of bargaining power in the litigation.</PARA>
<PARA>The paper states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One way suggested of alleviating any inequity in the present system might be to permit certain non-business litigation expenses incurred by individuals to be tax deductible, up to specified limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some limit might be imposed on the amount of litigation expenses that can be claimed as a deduction.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said before, and as the report indicates, at the moment financial institutions and big companies in these disputes have an open chequebook. They are protecting their revenue base. Instead of going to what should be an arbitration or some other type of arrangement, they are encouraged to take a matter the full course. That is only part of the problem. The manner in which they use those legal redresses is yet another. The action suggested is that the government commission a review of the current law and practice governing the tax deductibility of litigation legal expenses. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Not one member of the government is prepared to come in here and talk about this legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terror of those on the back bench is illustrated by the fact that they cannot even come in here and speak on the legislation. That gives a fascinating insight into what is really going on in the minds of those on the back bench of the Labor Party. It also shows that members of the Labor Party are terrified that, if they speak on this bill, maybe Australians will wake up to the fact that this government has been the greatest taxing government ever seen in this country. I will come back to that point in a little while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to support the amendment put forward by my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). I will read it out again so honourable members do not miss the point. In his amendment, the honourable member made two very clear points. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)condemns the Government for the ever burgeoning level of taxation since 1983, which has increased by more than double the rate of inflation . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members should take note of that. The level of taxation has increased by more than double the rate of inflation. If you listened to some of the answers the Treasurer (Mr Willis) was giving in question time today, you would think that he has great difficulty in grasping this. The second part of the opposition's amendment is that this House:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . deplores the high and growing cost to taxpayers of complying with an increasingly complex tax system.</PARA>
<PARA>Both of these are very valid points which highlight how this government has failed to understand what good government is about and how it should use a tax system to help the country prosper rather than penalise those who want to get out and have a go. We have had some discussion in the debate so far. I admit that it is a one-sided debate because, as I say, government members are terrified to come into the chamber. They are obviously frightened to talk about tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see what has happened over the years of Labor. When the capital gains tax was brought in, the then Prime Minister said, `After five years, we expect it to collect $50 million.' I think that in the first two years it got about 10 times that, so either he did not know what he was bringing in or, if he did, he was misleading the people of Australia. The capital gains tax is so complex that even today accountants are not fully aware of the extent of its impact. Some say that it will take years to fully see just how all pervasive capital gains tax is. It is now becoming a de facto form of death duties and, as the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) pointed out, on a number of occasions it is being substituted for death duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are myriad examples of the complexity of the fringe benefits tax. It is making a mockery of good tax policy and people are obviously losing great respect for the whole impact of that tax. Sales tax is being used in a fairly devious way. It is being jacked up. It is going to go up again this year. I can tell you that. You do not have to wait until the budget for that one, because it is already there. Sales tax is going up. It is being jacked up continually in a way that members of the Labor Party hope people will not be aware of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the tax which has had such an adverse and disproportionate impact on people who do not live in major cities&mdash;fuel tax. The way fuel tax has been mercilessly milked for revenue is staggering. The government believes that, if they have to travel, people have no option but to pay fuel tax. As I say, for people who live in regional and rural Australia, the impact has been very disproportionate. It has meant that not only the cost of travel has gone up dramatically but the cost of freight has gone up dramatically. When you look at just about everything you touch in the country of which freight is a component of the cost, you see how enormous the impact of all this has been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must have a few qualms about the tax laws becoming so complex. Just to give you an idea of how complex they are, I go back to some figures I produced for this House last year. In 1983 there were 2,731 pages of tax legislation. This is not an insignificant amount, but by 1994&mdash;I am talking about May 1994; there have been significant amounts more since then&mdash;there were over 6,700 pages. That is more than double the number of pages there were in 1983. Just think of the complexity that is there. I think that most tax experts will tell you that nowadays there are very few, if any, people in Australia who fully understand the tax laws of this country. That increase in the number of pages is just a nonsense. It makes a mockery of what good government is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to try to cover up for some of its mistakes and the stupidity of the Labor Party, the government then said, `Look, it is getting pretty complex. People are having trouble understanding it. We might introduce it into the secondary schools as a special subject.' So what does the government produce? It produces a pack called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Paying Tax</EMPHASIS>. What a little charmer. It is a new tax pack to teach people in schools all about tax. In the pack there are glossies, overheads, and&mdash;in case you think that tax is a serious matter&mdash;even things like tax cartoons. There is also a video. That the government would even consider putting people through this when obviously there are so many other subjects people ought to be learning about is, I think, a terrible indictment on the failure of this government. It has failed to make taxation a little simpler and something people can understand without being burdened with such complexities and enormous compliance costs. Instead, the government is almost inventing new taxes by the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we are now faced with new proposals because the government has finally woken up to the fact that it cannot go on running this major deficit. It is starting to catch up with it. I have to say to the government that the coalition has been warning for years of the problems of running continual deficits, and it seems that those warnings continually fall on deaf ears. Instead of saying, `Maybe we should have listened,' the government is saying, `Well, we will look for a new tax.' Is it going to be a wealth tax? It seems that, when ACOSS suggested wealth taxes, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) thought that would not be such a bad idea. Or is the government going to reintroduce death duties? Will it say, `It's not good enough just to tax people when they are alive; we are going to tax them when they die, too.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will happen to income tax? We have seen the flexibility with which the Labor Party handles income tax before elections: `It is not just going to be a promise; it is going to be a law.' As has been said in this debate, the spelling of l-a-w seems to change a little and it becomes an l-i-e. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to the carbon tax&mdash;a cat apparently let out of the bag today by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) when he embarrassed the Treasurer. It seems as though the Treasurer is sometimes the last to hear about these things. Nonetheless the Treasurer thought, `I'll try to ameliorate the concerns that people have and tell them "If we're going to have a carbon tax, it will be a relatively small tax"'. I have news for the Treasurer. Let me tell him a bit about history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the beginning of the 19th century, the British government introduced a temporary tax, a temporary measure. This temporary measure was brought in to help fund the cost of the Napoleonic wars. Guess what this temporary measure was called? It was called income tax. Sure, it came in as a relatively small tax. If my memory serves me correctly, it was 3 1/2 pence in the pound. That was the level at which income tax was introduced in Britain. Remember in those days there was not 100 pence in the pound but 240 pence in the pound. So it was a relatively small tax. It was supposed to be a temporary measure, but a funny thing happened. It is still there but it is no longer temporary. As this government has shown, it happens to like income tax and the amount is certainly no longer relatively small&mdash;as any PAYE taxpayer will tell you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When I listen to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer, I am reminded often of a little book available in all good bookshops and wonder how frequently they read it. It is a little Pelican book with a blue cover. It is not very thick and is quite easy to read. The book is titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">How to lie with statistics</EMPHASIS>. Listening to the Treasurer today, I seriously wonder whether he has in fact read it. The amendment requests that this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . condemns the Government for the ever burgeoning level of taxation since 1983, which has increased by more than double the rate of inflation . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That makes a very clear, simple point. Yet the Treasurer comes in here today and tries to justify what is going on by pulling out statistics and creating a very false picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that part of the amendment shows very clearly why no-one from the Labor Party is in the chamber. No wonder the Labor Party does not have anyone prepared to come into this debate. They are all so ashamed of the failure they have made in the general area of taxation and the fact that tax is going to be a major issue at the next election. Tax is an issue that we will be reminding people of because of the Prime Minister's great promise before the last election&mdash;the l-a-w, law. As soon as the election was over, he ripped up the l-a-w. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to focus on a couple of amendments to this legislation. Of particular concern is the amendment to the cost price of the natural increase of livestock and the sales tax exemption for panel vans and utility trucks of one-tonne capacity or more. When I read the explanatory memorandum concerning the cost price of the natural increase of livestock, I was rather amazed at the words the government chose to use. The purpose of the amendments is twofold, one of which is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to eliminate an inappropriate deferral of tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thought that was interesting. Then I thought, `Maybe we ought to go back to the fundamentals and look at the reason for having a cost price of natural increase of livestock below that of the market value.' Why has it been an accepted practice for decades for primary producers to use a lower value than either the cost price or the market value?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer is really very simple. If you say it will be at the higher value, you are saying that people should be paying tax on something that they have bred but have not sold. In other words, they have not received the money but they are expected to pay tax if there is a natural increase. I fail to see how that deferral of tax is inappropriate. Surely the whole point of fair tax law is that you pay tax on income as you receive it&mdash;and certainly not before. However, it seems as though this case is the thin end of the wedge. The government is now trying to overturn that long established practice by forcing primary producers to pay tax on the natural increase of livestock before they have even sold that livestock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example given in the explanatory memorandum is ostriches. One wonders about the significance of that example. Perhaps it is another case of the Canberra syndrome taking over, where the government has its head well and truly stuck in the sand and cannot see what, in reality, is happening to the people who have to go out there and earn a living. I agree with the point made by the member for Curtin that the government has so far failed dismally to explain the impact of this amendment to other livestock producers. In particular, how would producers handle it if the price of ostriches were to fall? We all know that it is at an extraordinarily high level right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Whilst I support the amendment that will provide a sales tax exemption on locally produced one-tonners, it is long overdue. It is very interesting to note that, as early as May 1993, my colleague Senator Watson introduced a private member's bill to this very effect. It was well researched, well prepared and it made a lot of sense. It seems as though two things can be drawn from this. First, the government was not man enough to admit that Senator Watson was totally right and to accept his private member's bill on the spot. That would have been the right thing to do. Second, the government does not even have the decency to acknowledge two years later that it was Senator Watson, through his private member's bill, who put forward the very proposals that it is now adopting. Again, that does not reflect very well on this government. When a very sensible amendment was put up in the other place in a private member's bill, one would have thought the government, with the availability of expertise it has in other departments, would have looked at the proposal straight away and said, `This is a fair enough amendment; we will accept it.' It seems as though the government is not man enough to do even that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I reiterate the point: it is little wonder that the backbenchers of the Labor Party are too frightened to come into this chamber and debate these bills. They are too frightened to raise the word `tax' because they are terrified of what is going on in the Treasurer's office right now. They are terrified of the way in which he is trying to find new taxes and increase existing taxes. There is also the increase in interest rates, which the government is inflicting on Australians right now&mdash;notwithstanding the nonsense spoken at question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind those opposite, particularly the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> notes that interest rates in Australia are already the highest in the Western world. Let us have none of this nonsense about history lessons. We are already at the top of the totem pole. To suggest, as has been put around as an expectation of the government, that interest rates are going to go higher shows just how out of touch it is and how little it understands about the damage that will cause to so many businesses in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When you put the two together&mdash;the fact that these new taxes will be sneaking in and the relatively small tax of the Treasurer&mdash;we will not be fooled; we have heard all that before. I mentioned what the fuel tax is already doing to people outside the capital cities. A carbon tax is nothing more than another fuel tax. I think that shows the government is totally out of touch. The sooner the election comes along and the sooner the people of Australia throw this bunch out, the better it will be for everyone concerned. </PARA>

The fact is that they do not understand the issues of tax and small business. They have no understanding at all because most of them have never been out there working in the real world.

It is nearly 10 months since the government called for submissions on that and we still have not heard anything from him about a review or about the introduction of any kinds of measures to simplify the compliance cost of fringe benefits tax. If honourable members on the other side did have any inkling or understanding of the business community, they would understand that their Assistant Treasurer's tardiness in this regard is costing the business community of Australia $350,000 per day. I will talk on that in greater depth in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As shadow spokesperson for small business, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this bill. The bill contains amendments to a wide range of tax measures. As we have come to expect, these amendments again clearly demonstrate that the Keating government has no understanding of the difficulties confronting Australia's business sector. We have been presented with another all-sorts collection of amendments that have no apparent relationship with each other. The issues addressed have obviously been chosen at random as they do not represent a structured consideration of any of the major issues confronting our taxation system today. It is yet another demonstration of the government's lack of a coherent strategy to plan for and prioritise its taxation legislation program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government is way out of touch with the concerns of business, in particular the needs of small and medium sized enterprises. Not one of these amendments addresses the issues of real concern and cost to small and medium sized enterprises in Australia. It is a sad indictment of this government that the repeated calls of our small business sector for tax reform continue to go unheeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small business sector has, through the Small Business Coalition, accepted the challenge of promoting in a very clear and concise manner issues relating to taxation policy that are of concern to the small business sector. The Small Business Coalition is a responsible organisation that was formed in 1990 to promote the interests of Australian small business. The Small Business Coalition has brought together some 40 national organisations, effectively covering nearly 1,000 business and professional associations at national, state and regional level, representing over half a million small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic contribution of and employment generated by these businesses is significant. They are the real achievers. These industry leaders know the issues. They know what is required to establish a sound business platform. One would think that a responsible government would not merely listen to their concerns but, importantly, would act upon them quickly. Most people understand that business confidence encourages investment, with subsequent benefits to business and employment growth. That seems to be a fact that has escaped this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a number of years the federal coalition in this parliament, the Small Business Coalition and other prominent business organisations have been vigorously promoting the need for action on a number of aspects of Australia's tax policy&mdash;taxation matters that impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the management, development and growth of small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what has been the response of this government? Nothing&mdash;absolutely no response on the things that matter to small business. The things that matter to this sector of our economy, enabling it to get on with the job of creating business and employment growth, clearly do not matter to this government. Many times the small business sector is offered flowery tokens by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), but their actions demonstrate no commitment to the real issues. When it comes to resolution of the hard issues, both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction have gone AWOL&mdash;absent without leave&mdash;or, in the case of small business, absent without action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This omnibus bill contains 17 measures that impact on business taxation, personal taxation and tax administration. Individually, each amendment addresses an important aspect of the tax system. However, in the overall scheme of things they are a fairly lightweight collection of amendments. When considered in the context of what really needs to be achieved with Australia's tax laws, the government has again demonstrated its inability to address the real issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to address each amendment specifically today. However, I will restrict my comments to those amendments which have a particular impact on small business. The amendment to the treatment of panel vans and utility trucks that carry one tonne or more will ensure consistency, irrespective of whether they are derived from passenger motor vehicles or not, and will be of particular benefit to some small business proprietors. The fact that these vehicles will now qualify for accelerated depreciation rates instead of general depreciation is of some benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The part of the bill dealing with capital gains tax aims to ensure that certain transactions involving the creation of assets and which effectively assign non-corporeal interests will be subject to capital gains tax. It addresses issues such as a future interest in a professional partnership, and is supported by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, again, an issue of real concern to small business is left lamenting in the shadows. Where is the government's consideration of the exemption from capital gains tax of the proceeds from the sale of a small business when the proceeds are rolled over into another small business? Where is the government's acknowledgment that the enthusiasm, dynamics and economic and employment potential of small business must be harnessed and projected to the advantage of the broader community? Where small business is concerned, the Prime Minister has a very short memory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the Prime Minister not remember that, after presenting the 1988 budget when he was the Treasurer, he asserted that `this is the one which brings home the bacon'? Well, it was in fact not long after that infamous statement that small business saved his bacon, and collectively Australia's bacon, by leading the economy out of the recession that `we had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's intransigence on the provision of capital gains tax rollover relief is simply a case of neglecting small business. It is a blatant failure to provide the appropriate incentives for this pivotal sector of the business community to develop and expand. In total there are approximately 757,000 small businesses in Australia, employing in excess of 2.5 million people. Overall, close to half of Australia's population could be relying on small business for a livelihood. One would think that a community group with that scope of influence would warrant serious consideration of issues of concern to its development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a government that cannot comprehend that in the small business sector we have dynamic, innovative and aggressive individuals who thrive on challenge, who are excited by the opportunity of creating new and discrete business opportunities&mdash;individuals who are willing to take risks and generate business and employment growth. However, they are continually frustrated by a lack of government attention to overcoming the real issues&mdash;the hurdles that prevent them from capitalising on opportunities and challenges. They can no longer tolerate a tired government. The provision of capital gains tax rollover relief on proceeds from the sale of an enterprise where the funds are invested in a like business would provide an appropriate incentive for small business proprietors to expand their business interests and expertise into new fields of endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes a number of changes to the new company tax instalment arrangements applicable for small and medium taxpayers for the 1994-95 financial year. The coalition supports these amendments as they rightly target tax avoidance arrangements which, if allowed to go undetected, increase the burden on other Australians. However, again the government has in respect of tax payments neglected to address an issue of concern to small business that has serious implications for small business cash flow management. I refer to the provisional tax uplift factor which in part determines the amount of provisional tax paid by small business taxpayers. The arrangements for the calculation of provisional tax provide that each year there is to be an uplift factor of 10 per cent unless this is varied. In June 1992 the then Treasurer announced that the provisional tax uplift factor was to reduce from 10 per cent to eight per cent. For the past two years the uplift factor has remained at that, despite the fact that headline inflation for the period has been under two per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's policy is a needless constraint on small business cash flow management. This is a direct consequence of small businesses, in most circumstances, being unable to borrow to meet tax liabilities, leaving cash flow as the only source of finance. Financial institutions are reluctant to lend for tax liabilities. An unrealistically high provisional tax uplift factor is a burden that small business should not have to confront. Associated with the uplift factor is the margin of error in self-assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognition of the complexities of tax policy, and the major consideration of small business being the generators of growth and employment opportunities, not being taxation policy experts, it would be beneficial to business confidence and reduce uncertainty if the self-assessment margin for error more closely reflected the complexity of taxation compliance. These are some of the real issues of concern to small business that have been continually raised by the Small Business Coalition. Undoubtedly, they will again be raised in the Senate Economics References Committee's current consideration of many aspects of tax policy and their impact on small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As in the past, this government is being dragged into a review process due to its lack of commitment to any form of reform. In this instance, it is small business that continues to suffer from government indecision. This stands in stark contrast to the repeated demonstrations from the Prime Minister of the `satisfying your mates' decisions so frequently made by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing Australia's national savings rate, it has to be said that this is a very important issue. It is in fact far too important to be treated in such a sloppy manner as is the case with this Keating government. This amendment, that is, the amendment to superannuation guarantee deferral of quarterly payments, highlights one of the major management problems of this government: the government's policy of legislation by press release of which we saw a very good example last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular case, the business community is treated with contempt, in that the government failed to put into place or even introduce legislation to defer the quarterly contributions scheme by the date that some employers would have been required to pay their quarterly contribution. Employers were left in the dark, not knowing whether to follow the letter of the law as it then stood, or follow the announcement by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For small business in particular, superannuation administration is yet another burgeoning cost. Through its actions, this government signals clearly that it neither cares nor understands the impact on business management of its sloppy administration and its legislation by press release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to note that this bill contains one amendment relating to the publication of Australian Taxation Office rulings. The removal of the uncertainty surrounding when a ruling is made is long overdue. However, one aspect of Australian Taxation Office rulings that must be mentioned and questioned is their proliferation, complexity, and the management process that is required to keep abreast of these rulings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 3 February 1995 that in 1994 the Australian Taxation Office issued a new ruling for every day of the year. These rulings impact on a wide and varied range of taxation law. The major concern for small business is the uncertainty created by the constant introduction of new rulings. In an environment where a new ruling is being released, on average, every day of the year, what hope does a small business operator have of keeping abreast of current tax policy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, what is the flow-on cost to small business from its financial advisers being forced to employ additional resources to ensure that the introduction of a new ruling is understood and effectively transmitted to decision makers? In addition to this ongoing expense, many advisers spend many hours researching and commenting on the ATO's draft rulings and determinations. This environment leads to uncertainty and confusion for management, increases costs but, importantly, highlights the imperative to complete the tax law simplification project. In this regard, the government has again demonstrated its total lack of commitment to reducing the burden of taxation on the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While on the one hand it has implemented the tax law improvement project which is rewriting the current tax law into plain English, the government has not been able to demonstrate any commitment to the principle of tax simplification. This bill has been drafted and presented in the `old style', which will simply need to be rewritten at a later date. What better example of this government's inefficient and wasteful practices could you expect to find?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in the speech, I alluded to the Keating government's inability to address the tough challenges in respect to policy; to make the decisions that count for small business; to be ahead of the game and not always playing catch-up to business requirements; and, importantly, to provide small business with the confidence that its contribution to the economy and the community is valued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The presentation of this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) was a golden opportunity for the government to take a tough decision on an issue of immense importance to all Australian businesses, big and small. I refer specifically to the fringe benefits tax compliance review. As honourable members will remember, the Treasurer announced this review in the 1994 budget. The Assistant Treasurer had carriage of the review and circulated to business and professional organisations and the media the following information:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have today written to a wide range of tax professionals, business and employer groups seeking their input into the Government's review of the costs of complying with the Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review was announced by the Treasurer in the Budget. Its aim is to identify areas where complying with the FBT laws causes difficulty for employers, and practical ways of addressing those difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outcomes of the review must be consistent with protecting the tax base and the overall equity of the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the review, officers of the Australian Taxation Office have already held discussions with representatives of the major accounting and tax professional bodies. As a result, there is a range of practical suggestions deserving of closer consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am optimistic that submissions in reply to my letter will add to that list.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government hopes to announce the outcome of the review by the end of July.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That was July 1994, not July 1995. The Assistant Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, people interested in making submissions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and wait for this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are asked to make them by 17 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a budget measure that came out in May 1994 and the government is giving the business and professional communities less than one month to respond and make their submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the government imposed a very tight deadline on submissions to this review. Business, professional and industry groups were given less than one month and in good faith went ahead and made those submissions. With that promising invitation, business could be excused for thinking that the government was serious. But, in true form, what has really happened? Absolutely nothing&mdash;at a cost to business in this country today of $350,000 every day this review goes on without any action being taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has again shown that it is simply incapable of making any commitment to reducing the burdens it has imposed on the business community. The government's tardy consideration of the FBT review is a clear statement that it simply does not care, that it has no capacity to address the issues of concern to business and small business in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response is not only 219 days late but, importantly, it is costing this nation's business $350,000 per day. A further $76 million in compliance costs have been expended by business&mdash;and I am talking about compliance costs; I am not talking about the tax which is another issue. It is an absolute waste of resources that is being condoned by this Keating government. How many jobs have been lost? How much new investment has been forgone? How much incentive to expand and develop business opportunities has been lost due to the government's inability to act?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are a step in the right direction towards ensuring that the tax system is conducive to the efficient conduct of business.

<PARA>This is a stinging indictment on the Labor Party's administration of our tax system, though it is hardly surprising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FBT, which was introduced a decade ago, has had so many additions made to it that it is simply aimed at maximising revenue rather than achieving the aim for which it was first introduced: taxing employee benefits which are given instead of income. Nowadays, non-fringe benefits which are being treated as such are being taxed, and the administration of it is totally stupid and utterly complex. </PARA>

It is little wonder the FBT compliance costs for small business have been estimated to be 42.1 per cent of the tax collected off them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has often spoken of Australia being a competitive nation within the Asia-Pacific region. But, if you ask the people who know, the word is that Australia is far from being competitive and the millstone around the neck of the business community is our ridiculous taxation system. In the April 1994 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Business Monthly</EMPHASIS>, in an article entitled `Taxed to the limits', Australia's tax system is described as a shambles. Describing our tax system, it says of it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For years, bits have been tacked on until the original fabric is no longer visible; indeed, the legislation is now almost impenetrable.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's tax system leaves a lot to be desired. It is neither equitable nor understandable and generates millions of dollars in non-productive compliance costs as individuals and companies structure their affairs to try to please the greedy tax man.</PARA>
<PARA>And for `greedy tax man' you should read the Prime Minister. He needs to be greedy to fund the bribes he offers to the various lobby groups to pay for their votes. The article goes on to explain how, instead of being the lowest taxing nation in the OECD&mdash;as the Prime Minister falsely tries to assert&mdash;Australia is in the middle of the OECD range and well in excess of the Asian countries that we are so keen to be part of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That recent survey in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> also found that the Prime Minister's comments about our country being one of the lowest taxed nations in the OECD were false. If we are to bring the budget into surplus, we do need a total reform of the system and the government must consider the consumption side of taxation. John Prescott, the Managing Director of BHP, said of the tax act:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rewriting the tax act must receive priority&mdash;we have one of the most complex tax systems in the world, which generates uncertainty and imposes costly compliance on taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The whole business community echoes these views, yet the government has dragged its feet. In fact, it has put the reform vehicle in reverse. Instead of reforming our tax system to make it fairer, simpler and more efficient, our tax system has become more unfair, more complex and much less efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that, look what the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said in a press release in August 1994 outlining the government's response to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCPA Report clearly endorses the ATO's current approach to tax administration, while making many suggestions for improvement. Most of the suggestions seem to us aimed at fine-tuning the tax system, rather than fundamentally altering it.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the Assistant Treasurer has been in the sheltered workshop called Parliament House for too long and does not know what is happening in the real world. The bill simply adds to the complexity of the existing act, which is anything but fair and simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That same press release reiterated the government's commitment to simplifying the huge body of income tax law so that it is written in plain English, with a structure readily followed and easily adapted to future tax needs. Does the Assistant Treasurer match his rhetoric with action? Of course he does not. Here we are debating an omnibus bill, or at least on this side of the House we are debating it&mdash;with 17 measures affecting four different acts&mdash;which does not match the plain English style commitment of the government. So this will go through parliament only to have to go back to the drawing board of the tax law improvement project for simplification later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill undermines previous commitments of the government and is simply adding to the burdens of an already overburdened business community. This bill is but another piece of legislation aiming to serve the government's objective of maximising taxation revenue rather than providing simple, fair and efficient laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer also to a media release put out by the National Tax Agents Association, now the National Tax and Accountants Association, following the 1993 substantiation audit undertaken by the Australian Taxation Office. It found that all taxpayers had made an error in their returns. Capital gains and termination payments recorded a 100 per cent error rate, with an average adjustment of just over $1,300, and the average adjustment for terminations was a whopping $7,200. Such returns would have the taxpayers branded by the Prime Minister as tax cheats. Yet the problem is the legislation. Despite this evidence, we still have a tax act which is riddled with difficulties, raising the compliance costs and wasting time. It is simply unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has proven, in the administration of our tax laws, that it is full of rhetoric but sadly lacking in action. We have been promised reform of the fringe benefits tax&mdash;and major reform is needed&mdash;yet the government has not done a thing. The review of the FBT is eight months overdue&mdash;eight months&mdash;and we are still waiting, which is of considerable frustration to professional bodies and businesses alike. We were also promised simplified tax laws. Laws are to be drafted in plain English so that it is easier to understand and therefore cheaper to comply with; and, therefore, making the laws more efficient and fairer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax law improvement project was announced in December 1993. In August last year the Assistant Treasurer said the project had already begun the task of simplifying the huge body of income tax law. And look at what we are debating today&mdash;a mishmash bill which defies everything the government promised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is more than clear that the whole tax act is a shambles. Indeed, it is, due to its user unfriendly nature, near obsolete. Instead of debating but another bill adding more amendments to the tax act, it is time the government plucked up the courage to reform the entire tax system: rewrite the whole lot in plain English and reform it to be fair, equitable and simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from this bill the government lacks a strategy for tax reform. It is clear from its reneging on promises that it does not have any organisation or prioritisation of what it wants to do. It simply decides how much money it needs to bribe the voters. Then it changes the tax act to milk every cent it can out of Australian taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, to back up everything we on this side of the House have said, let me quote an excerpt from the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whatever it takes</EMPHASIS>, the very first time Graham Richardson told the truth.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax system is on its last legs, it's had it. To put it crudely, it's stuffed.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the state of the tax system in 1985, and not too much has changed. In fact, it has only been made worse.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill now before the House represent the most significant attempt by an Australian government to introduce competitive forces into the nation's administration of the health system. On that criterion alone, the legislation is worthy of support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effective competition is basic to the success of all markets&mdash;economic and social. Competition fosters price benefits and better standards of service for consumers and negates the worst features of monopoly profits and monopoly rents. Competition is the powerful force&mdash;the invisible hand of economic interest and innovation&mdash;needed to lift the nation's productivity and international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition also has an important, albeit carefully managed, role to play in the effective delivery of social products. Accordingly, I support the intention of the bills before the House to foster competition and consumer benefits in Australia's private health insurance sector. I do so, however, not without due caution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonsense says that the success of market deregulation, such as that proposed in these reforms, can be tested only in the market and may be subject to unpredictable outcomes. The successful introduction of purchaser-provider arrangements between private health funds and hospitals, both public and private, relies on the convergence of competition theory and actual market conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's health financing arrangements are complex. In a geographically large nation such as ours, with a small but widely dispersed population, the private health insurance industry is unlikely to feature perfect competition, particularly in rural and regional centres. In country health regions, the integration of services with multidisciplinary outlets is more important than market contests between providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By its very nature, health is unlikely to display strong, let alone perfect, consumer knowledge of market choices and product differentiation. As people naturally place a high value on their health, they are more likely to consume a service rather than risk the downside of not consuming. High levels of public and private insurance in health also tend to diminish the conventional impact of the pricing mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competition reforms in this legislative package are, by my best assessment, worthy of enactment and support across the parliament. They will require close and thorough monitoring by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and her department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other aspects of the legislation I fully support and endorse the introduction of case payments, aggregate billing and new consumer protection standards. They flow logically from attempts to establish competitive market influences in this part of the economy. Too often it is assumed that social goods and services can only be delivered in the public interest by government monopoly outlets. This ignores the immense contribution to the social sector of privately owned, especially not-for-profit, service providers. Ownership does not matter as much as outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has committed itself to the continuous reform of the Australian economy directed at a range of competition reforms&mdash;as the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is in the chamber, knows full well. We should be no less vigilant in the continuous reform of social programs. Significant gains can be made, under certain market conditions, from the introduction of competition policies for social products. This approach seeks to lower the unit cost and improve the allocation of public resources by stimulating competitive market forces. Competition in social policy can be administered in one way or through a combination of two ways: on the supply or production side, encouraging both publicly and privately owned providers to compete for service based contracts from government purchasing authorities; or, on the demand or distribution side, giving consumers a market choice in the purchase of goods and services from competing providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In health, where consumer power and market knowledge is relatively limited, this can, at least in theory, be achieved through insurance funds acting as agents for their members and negotiating on their behalf price efficient arrangements with service providers. The effectiveness of these methods, however, is limited by the extent of social market imperfections. For instance, education vouchers&mdash;advocated by the Liberal Party at the last federal election as a way of fostering consumer choice between universities&mdash;are made impractical by factor immobility in the education market. That is, universities cannot rapidly adjust their capital stock of buildings and equipment to cope with wide fluctuations in student numbers&mdash;a very important market imperfection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health care markets have traditionally featured three main blemishes: limited consumer knowledge and choice on service types, diminution of the pricing mechanism and a historic difficulty with the quantification of costs and prices. It is a necessary condition for allocative efficiency that the prices of substitutable products reflect production costs. At least with this requirement, substantial progress has been made through the introduction of diagnosis related groups&mdash;categories of treatment types to which costings can be applied&mdash;and the introduction in some states, not all, of casemix funding. I congratulate the minister for health for fostering a national commitment to case payments and, through this legislation, bringing casemix&mdash;a very important reform&mdash;to the private sector with the cooperation of the Australian Private Hospitals Association and insurer agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Casemix or output related payments involve complex aspects of data collection which have become feasible only in the last decade through advances in health information technology. They are based on the commonsense proposition that efficient production is achieved by paying producers for their output instead of their input. Producers respond to a fixed price on output by trying to meet client demand at the lowest cost. While case payments are best known for their transformation of hospital budgets and management, they are just as applicable and useful in other parts of the health system. In 1988, for example, nursing home funding moved from a cost based approach to an output based system. A similar approach has been adopted for federally funded hostels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Casemix represents a simple but effective change in the financing of hospitals. The traditional method of funding&mdash;fixed annual allocations totally unrelated to output&mdash;simply institutionalises hospital inefficiency. Public hospitals would invariably increase their waiting lists as a means of attracting additional government funding. That is still happening in those states that have not adopted the casemix approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Casemix funding, which pays hospitals according to the services they perform, provides the strongest possible incentive to increase activity and cut waiting lists. The introduction of case payments should not be a matter of partisan politics. It is a practical measure to provide the necessary incentive and management motivation for improved hospital efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intelligent development of casemix throughout the health system offers a good opportunity for the equitable funding of agencies and more effective care for patients. Significant efficiency gains can be realised from funding health services on the basis of output rather than input. It is the intention of this legislation that these efficiency gains be passed on from hospitals and insurance funds to consumers through more competitive premium rates&mdash;a clear and very important micro-reform in this legislation introduced by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition policies on the demand or distribution side of the health market involve a model of managed insurance competition initially developed in the United States by health economist Alain Enthoven. This model aims to facilitate consumer choice between competing health insurance plans. Enthoven has summarised his scheme as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . experience with successful models of competition among health plans suggests that tools are available to enable sponsors to use competition to achieve a reasonable degree of efficiency and equity for their sponsored populations. Sponsors are active collective agents (governments or some other form of pooled resources) on the demand side of the market who contract with the competing health (insurance) plans and continuously structure and adjust the market to overcome its tendency to failure.</PARA>
<PARA>Managed insurance competition is based on the belief that a competing set of agents would act on behalf of consumers and use their countervailing market power to purchase wisely and efficiently from both public and private service providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as travel agents shop around the travel industry to bring together the best package for their customers, it is intended that health insurance companies secure the best deals for their members. Choice would be maximised through a large number of competing agents. Under Enthoven's deregulated market governments would fulfil their safety net obligations for universality and access through a risk-rated capitation payment for each consumer. These payments, with the option of privately funded supplements, would be used to purchase the insurance plan best suited to the needs of each consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform package before the House promotes several important features of this managed insurance competition model: that is, encouraging health funds to shop around on behalf of their clients and establish contractual arrangements with service providers. The private health funds in Australia have not been able to offer their members&mdash;especially younger, healthier people&mdash;sufficient value for money with a tendency to overprice premiums and overfill reserves. That is the key to this legislative package of reforms before the House. From 1986-87 to 1992-93 average premiums increased by 117 per cent while the reserves held by the funds increased by 75 per cent&mdash;not the measure of competitive industry passing on price and service improvements to their customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rational low risk consumers are likely to opt out of private insurance if they continue to cross-subsidise high risk consumers and pay premiums in excess of the benefits they expect to receive. This highlights the importance of the reforms before the House: that is, the opportunity for private health funds in Australia to improve their market share through competitive pricing, single billing and other consumer benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While acknowledging the significance of this opportunity and these reforms it is, nonetheless, more important in my assessment to recognise the relatively restricted role that private health insurance reforms play in the proper management of Australia's health system. I take my inspiration and guidance on this matter from Neal Blewett who served as one of the best health ministers ever seen in the national parliament. Dr Blewett gave his last speech on 10 February last year. I remember it well because the day before&mdash;9 February&mdash;I was sworn in as the member for Werriwa. Mr Deputy Speaker, you can imagine the interest and guidance I took from Neal Blewett's last speech in this place. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any decent health economist will tell you that the levels of private insurance are a third or fourth order subject. The central issue for the health system is the working of the public hospital system.</PARA>
<PARA>We&mdash;unlike the opposition&mdash;should rank private insurance rates as a low order question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy challenge for governments should be to let the insurance market find its own level of consumer support, not to artificially prop up the market at public expense. We should not be paying public subsidies to private organisations in a market where competition should feature on the health insurance side. Subsidies in the health system should be used to support public access measures rather than indirectly fund services above and beyond the government's safety net provisions in health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This highlights fully the absolute folly of the opposition&mdash;particularly that of its former spokesperson, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop)&mdash;in advocating tax breaks to prop up rates of private health insurance. What amounts to a public sector subsidy through revenue forgone for the Commonwealth should not be used to prop up the private sector. It should be used most sensibly to achieve national goals of universality, access and equity in health. That is the proper way in which to frame health policies. I certainly hope that the new shadow spokesperson for health, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), addresses the issue and understands this essential aspect of health policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a full tax credit were provided for medical and hospital cover it would cost the government almost $3 billion per annum to fund the subsidy to the private sector. Fightback was costed, to my understanding, at well over $1 billion in public subsidies flowing through to the private sector. In the assessment of health markets, there is no evidence anywhere in the world of market equilibrium in health. Public and private market shares depend entirely on market circumstances and government regulations. It is an absolute misuse and abuse of public funds to put an artificial floor under the private market. It simply shifts costs from the public sector to the private sector without any proven gain in access and quality of service. Because of the cost to the public system, I would argue that it would result in absolute negatives&mdash;a disadvantage to health consumers. Public money should be used to guarantee policy goals in the public interest: universality, access and equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need only look at the figures on the international scale to understand that in Australia the proportion of health funding from the public sector is not high. In 1991 Australia was 19th among 23 OECD nations in the government's share of total health spending. We ranked behind Norway with 97 per cent, New Zealand with 79 per cent, and Canada with 72 per cent&mdash;just to mention three nations with which Australia would draw comparisons in the management of its national health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The methodology of good health reform is to get effective public safety net provisions in place&mdash;the sorts of reforms I outlined in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper last week. This concerns service integration and simplification and regionalisation of service delivery to make sure that we overcome some of the locational inequities that are currently experienced in regions such as the south-west of Sydney and, very importantly, the realignment of federal and state funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time for both sides of the parliament to end the pointless federal-state dispute over the management of the health system. It is time to end the artificial debate prompted by people like the honourable member for Mackellar about public and private market shares. The truth is that state governments come and go. Some are good Labor governments and some are not so good Labor governments. Of course, we have coalition governments as well. These governments come and go at the state level. But the health structure in Australia stays the same if we do not get national leadership whereby the parliament demonstrates that there is a way to rationalise health delivery, health structures and health financing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inevitable fall in private health insurance in Australia should be used as a catalyst for structural reform. By my assessment, competition policies and the use of the purchaser-provider split work better on the supply side of the market: that is, administered by regional health authorities offering comprehensive and integrated service delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of purchasers or regional authorities would be to assess the health needs of their client populations and arrange contracts with providers to deliver high quality services as efficiently and effectively as possible. The service provider role would involve competition to secure performance based contracts specifying appropriate price, quantity and quality arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of public beds in private hospitals would help address the issue of underutilised resources in our hospital system. In Canada, for instance, private hospitals have been incorporated into the health system on the same basis as public hospitals: that is, they are obliged to provide free care and the choice of doctor in standard wards in return for a maintenance subsidy from provincial authorities. Private insurance is only required for the additional costs of preferred accommodation and out-of-hospital ancillary services. Doctors in public and private hospitals are paid on a fee-for-service basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This system in Australia would also end the discrimination that public patients face in gaining access to public hospitals for elective treatment. Current financial incentives favour the treatment of private patients in public hospitals and encourage queue jumping, a problem that the Minister for Human Services and Health has had to deal with in her negotiations with the states. Public patient services are restricted in Australia by budget caps and rationed waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a better way. The introduction of equal access to hospital care in Australia&mdash;that is, choice of hospital and choice of doctor&mdash;would shift between $2 billion and $2.5 billion from private insurance premiums into the taxation system and provide a vastly improved method of hospital service delivery to health consumers. It represents the equivalent of a one to 1.3 per cent increase in the Medicare levy. Medicare would cover all consumers for these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 national health strategy paper on hospital services in Australia presented a summary of this proposal: choice of doctor and choice of hospital to all through a single national insurer. The potential financial impact on family incomes was generally progressive and generally of great promise on the delivery of health and equity issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main obstacle to this approach in Australia would arise from the objections of the private sector. The users of private hospitals would be discouraged from maintaining their private health insurance. The managers of private for-profit hospitals would resent the imposition of budgetary ceilings and other regulations. There is evidence to suggest, however, that some private hospital groups, sensibly responding to the inevitable decline in private insurance, are willing to pursue public sector revenue opportunities. Health Care of Australia, for example, with 10 per cent of the private hospital sector, has taken a policy stance of wanting governments to plan, fund and monitor hospitals but to leave their operation to the most efficient providers. I support that stance. I support competition policies such as those reflected in the legislation but I am always willing to flesh out a better way for health policy in the general interests of an internationally admired and effective health system for all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us have no illusions: this Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill is an attempt by the Labor Keating government to paper over some of the most serious, critical and strategic problems with the Australian health system. It attempts to convince the parliament, and eventually the electorate, that this legislation will have a dramatic effect: it will bring about a reduction in private health insurance premiums and thus stem the flow of people from private health insurance funds; it will introduce greater competition between health funds by introducing new products; and it will introduce casemix funding in private hospitals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, this bill has some appealing elements but let us not be under any illusions. When we consider the real problems with our health system we cannot escape the conclusion that the government is attempting to bring in legislation a few months prior to an election. I believe that the strategy of the Labor government was to bring it in late last year, or at least in early February, in the belief that it would be going to the people by March or April and the effect of these reforms would not be embedded in time for the real effects to be judged by the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, things have got away from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and it is fairly clear now that he will be unable to go before the people in an election within the next few months. It is more likely to be later this year or early next year. So, in a way, this legislation will catch the government out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this legislation is enacted without amendment it will show that the government is incapable of dealing with the major problems besetting our health system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes that I have before the adjournment&mdash;I will be able to continue tomorrow&mdash;I would like to give you a brief overview. Firstly, the federal government has managed the levers of health for the last 12 years or thereabouts. In that time it introduced a system called Medicare, which has been wholeheartedly supported by the coalition. I want to put that on the record: the Medicare system of universality is supported wholeheartedly by the coalition. So let there be no misrepresentation by people&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XU5">Mr LIEBERMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, despite strong attempts by the Labor Party to mislead the community and misrepresent the coalition's position. When the Medicare system was introduced&mdash;it applies across Australia and requires all the states to be party to it, through funding of public hospitals in particular, through the provision of health services by private as well as hospital doctors&mdash;the promise of the then Hawke government, and of the Keating government since, to the Australian people was that this system of Medicare would provide all Australians with access to public health facilities, to public hospitals, free of charge and within a reasonable time. I have still in my office at home the letter that the Prime Minister wrote to all Australians&mdash;it started `Dear Fellow Australians'&mdash;promising just that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But right from the start the Commonwealth government made an error in introducing this major reform. That error was the failure to take account of the increasing costs of health and the failure to factor into the health plan it was introducing a system that would ensure that the product could be delivered. In other words, it underfunded and has continued to underfund Medicare for the last 12 years. That is the fundamental reason for the problems we have today&mdash;and things are getting worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that the Medicare concept failed to address&mdash;it was not Medicare's failure but the inability of the federal government to resolve matters because of its very close affiliation with state trades hall councils&mdash;was to ensure that our public hospitals, the recipients of and the major players in this scheme in many ways, were able to deal efficiently with the issues and challenges they were required to face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear what the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) had to say about the health system. He has obviously thought very deeply and carefully about it and I am sure that he has a contribution to make to the system. I do not agree with all the things that he said but I enjoyed his contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great problems with running our hospitals is that they are very labour intensive. The Royal Melbourne Hospital is the biggest public hospital in my state of Victoria. I recall from when I was health minister and subsequently the shadow health minister that it employed some 3,000 people&mdash;a vast resource of people, talent and commitment. Nevertheless, they are people who jealously guard their resources. It is the nature of people in the health system to build fences around their programs and strive to get more funding for them so that they can be expanded. In so doing, those on the other side of the fence in the health family are not always allowed to share the resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the basic problems in managing the health system: the major consumers of the health dollar are public hospitals. The very large public hospitals in Victoria, I think&mdash;just three or four major hospitals in Melbourne&mdash;use up about 70 per cent of the allocation for public hospitals in the whole of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the reason for the problems is that Labor governments federally over the last 12 years have failed to provide the leadership and resources to the states to enable the necessary reforms to take place quickly enough so that the hospitals will use these scarce health dollars efficiently and, above all, provide to the Australian community the sort of system that was promised by former Prime Minister Hawke and has continued to be promised by this Labor government, but has not been delivered; that is, access to public hospital care when you want it, within a reasonable time, for you and your family. </PARA>

Surprise, surprise; in that article the Labor Party of New South Wales was strangely silent on where the money was going to come from to fund its promise of abolishing tolls on the M4 and the M5.

I warn the people of New South Wales: do not believe the Labor Party when it says there will be no tolls.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZT4">Mr SOMLYAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is about the Labor Party's record on tolls in Queensland. My colleague asks me to talk about the Sunshine Coast; and I will. In 1989, the Queensland National Party government acknowledged that the four-lane highway through Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast was putting a strain on its internal roads; so it proposed to build a new road to take all that traffic. It decided to finance it by a network of toll plazas. There was a massive protest against the proposal to have toll plazas. After a series of protests by local citizens and prominent members of the ALP, the proposal was dropped and was replaced with a single toll across the Maroochy River between Maroochydore and Noosa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Goss, and all the Labor candidates on the Sunshine Coast promised that should they win government the toll would be abolished. Goss's election promise was a clear and unequivocal commitment, signed personally by him, and sent out by direct mail. I notice that the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) is in the chamber; I think he authorised that direct mail when it went out. There was no question that, if the Labor Party achieved government, the toll would be abolished. Surprise, surprise! Immediately after the election, Wayne Goss announced that to abolish the toll would be too expensive. He apologised to the people for his broken promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a short period, the people were allowed to travel that road at no charge while two new tollgates were built further south on the same road. The motorway was finally extended further towards Noosa and the toll was reintroduced on the Maroochy River&mdash;on the bridge. The toll that Labor abolished was reintroduced so that now there were three tollgates. Instead of a one-dollar National Party toll, we now have three Wayne Goss Labor Party tolls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called private company operating the Sunshine Coast motorway is, in reality, a front for the Queensland Department of Transport. This is so the money borrowed by the tollways does not show up in the budget and the Queensland government's borrowings do not go over prescribed limits. This is how Queensland Labor governments hide mismanagement. The last annual report for the motorway company showed revenue for the motorway had increased but so had loan borrowings to keep the company afloat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The toll road cost $120 million to build. Last year, patronage of the tollway was up by 60 per cent and revenue rose to almost $6 million; but borrowings from the Queensland Department of Transport increased to $210 million. The operating loss for 1993-94 was $16.7 million, more than three times the revenue from the ill-fated toll road. The fact is that the people of Queensland are paying twice for the toll; once through the tolls and again through taxes and motor vehicle registrations. That money, I suppose, is being spent elsewhere as the government props up the road financially. So I say to the people of New South Wales: do not believe the Labor Party when it says there will be no tolls. It reneged on its election promise in Queensland; and it is a certainty it will do it in New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a truism that you cannot understand the potential for the future of your country unless you understand and appreciate its history. I think the same is true of institutions in Australia, and I think it is true of political parties. It is certainly true of the Liberal Party. In its 50th anniversary year we find that we need to study its history. We find the official history of the Liberal Party, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Menzies' Child: the Liberal Party of Australia: 1944 to 1994</EMPHASIS>, by Gerard Henderson, and we are told there is a free CD enclosed. I will come to the CD shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to make sure that if we are relying upon history we are appreciative of the fact that it is a good history. So I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 12 and 13 November, where there is a review of this particular book. The review says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the book is a thoughtful contribution to non-Labor politics in general and the history of the Liberal Party in particular.</PARA>
<PARA>The reviewer says in the course of his review:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Menzies' Child</EMPHASIS> is easy to read. The insertion into the historical narrative of contemporary reflections from personal interviews is enlivening . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The reviewer also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The criticism made by Henderson that too few Liberals have a strong sense of the liberal-conservative political tradition in Australia is also valid. Some are not even aware of its existence . . .</PARA>
<PARA>We are only too aware of its existence over here, because this review was done by John Howard, the federal member for Bennelong, now the Leader of the Opposition, the self-proclaimed most conservative leader that the Liberal Party has ever had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see whether we can find something enlivening from some of those personal interviews of which the Leader of the Opposition is so appreciative. We find at page 280 of Henderson's book an interview with Malcolm Fraser, who, commenting on the role that Andrew Peacock and John Howard have had to play in the course of the history of the Liberal Party, states, `I don't think I want to comment except to say that between the two of them they wasted the decade of the 80s totally.' That is the decade of the 1980s, but we know that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, wasted 1975 to 1980 as well as the period up to 1983 when he was Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You need only look at some relevant economic statistics to see that this is historically accurate and true. The average rate of economic growth under John Howard was 2.1 per cent. Under Labor it has been 3.4 per cent. The rate of inflation when John Howard left office was 11.4 per cent. The current rate of inflation is 2.5 per cent. The average rate of inflation under John Howard was 9.7 per cent. Since June 1990 inflation has been at about two per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at interest rates. When John Howard left office as Treasurer in March 1983 the 90-day bank bill rate was 15.9 per cent. On Friday of last week it was just over eight per cent&mdash;almost twice as good. The statistics go on. We have seen the total wasting of the 1970s and the 1980s, as related to us by the Liberal Party's historian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to see what Henderson has had to say about John Howard himself. I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 8 and 9 October. This is very illuminating. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Howard passed his former adviser, Gerard Henderson, in a Sydney street recently. They exchanged greetings and Howard asked what had happened to the recording of a 1953 speech by Robert Menzies which had been uncovered and handed to Henderson in his capacity as director of the Sydney Institute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Henderson told him that the recording of Menzies, who had just returned from London and an audience with the Queen, had been made into a CD for distribution in his forthcoming book on the Liberal Party, Menzies' Child.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have the CD&mdash;`Menzies child: the British Crown', a speech by R.G Menzies made in Sydney on 9 October 1953. The story goes on, quoting Henderson to Howard:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "You'll like the speech," Henderson said. "Menzies in 1953 sounds a lot like you today."</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rather than make a tirade against people in this House, I am going to speak on an issue that does not usually excite such emotions. It is a fact that the nations of the world may not be able to save tigers from extinction. The threat of the tiger becoming extinct is something that stirs the emotions of many people. Although these animals are not native to Australia, the majestic image of these animals has captured the imagination of people all over the world for centuries.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V5">Mr PYNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not dogs, you fool&mdash;they are cats. Despite this universal fascination with these animals, the threat of extinction is quickly descending upon the tiger. An article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time Australia</EMPHASIS> in March 1994 estimated a 95 per cent decline in the tiger population this century. Peter Jackson, chairman of the World Conservation Union's Cat Specialist Group, suggests that the extinction of the tiger could occur by the end of the decade. The Caspian subspecies became extinct more than a decade ago. So did the Balinese and Javan cats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plight of tigers is one of the top priorities of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species to which Australia is a signatory. Last year Bill Clinton was under pressure to evoke the Pelly amendment against countries that traded in tiger parts&mdash;a law that calls for trade sanctions to force compliance with an international agreement aimed at protecting endangered species. However, despite this international concern, the number of wild tigers continues to rapidly decrease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until a couple of years ago, the fate of the tigers seemed safe. A concerted effort to save the tiger was started in the 1970s with the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi launching Project Tiger. This was a key initiative, as India is home to an estimated 60 per cent of the world's tigers. The project saw the establishment of 21 reserves with the purpose of providing a safe haven for tigers to replenish their numbers. Numbers increased from 1,827 tigers in the country in 1973 to 4,334 in 1989. It seemed then that the tiger had been saved. However, over the past five years the parks' tiger population has dropped by 35 per cent because of poaching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tiger parts have been consumed as part of traditional medicines in China and Taiwan for centuries. The tiger population in China has been exhausted, so tiger parts from animals poached in countries such as India and eastern Russia are commanding handsome prices on the black markets of China and Taiwan. Due to pressure from the UN and Western conservation groups, the governments in both countries have made commitments to stop the trade in tiger parts. However, Western conservation groups remain sceptical. For instance, the Washington based Environmental Investigation Agency recently found tiger bone in 13 of the 21 pharmacies it checked in Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grip of the tiger on the human imagination has meant that many still believe the animal is the source of healing powers. Tiger bone potions are believed to be a cure for rheumatism and to enhance longevity. Whiskers are used to ease toothache. Skin is used as a cure for malaria and infectious fevers. Bones have a number of uses, including relief from ulcers, rheumatism, stomach pain, typhoid, malaria and rabies. In Taiwan one of the more interesting practices is the consumption of tiger penis soup for as much as $320 a bowl in the hope of propping up a flagging libido. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many factors cloud the decision of how best to deal with poaching. The edges of these tiger parks are inhabited by very poor villagers. Middlemen pay poachers from $100 to $300 per animal in areas where an average wage is $1 a day. Clearly the benefits of poaching far outweigh the risks for needy poachers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clash between cultures on how to treat the tiger as an endangered species or as a source of healing power is underlined by a mutual fascination with tigers. It seems strange that in the face of this mutual fascination the international community is reduced to standing by and merely watching the tiger become extinct. As an Assistant Secretary of State who leads US diplomatic efforts to help the tiger said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the concerted efforts of the world cannot save the tiger, what will that say about our ability to deal with more complex environmental problems?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say I have never really seen the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) before as a real wild tiger, but obviously he has a very strong interest in the welfare of tigers and cats, and for that the House should be grateful. In this adjournment debate I was planning to continue my presentation to the House about the benefit of Hilmer type reforms, but I must confess I have been so inspired by my colleagues the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) that I would like to turn to one of their themes; that is, books about and by the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the Christmas break I, too, did a little light reading&mdash;light being the operative word. I picked up a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Heart of Liberalism</EMPHASIS>, edited by the member for Moore (Mr Filing), who is in the chamber, the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) and the member for Deakin (Mr Aldred). The day after this was released, the member for Deakin lost his preselection. So this cannot be regarded as a volume that held great weight and gravity within the Victorian Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, having looked at the editors and the contributors, I thought it was worth a read. Chapter by chapter, backbenchers, prominent and not so prominent, have their go at various policy themes. But I was quite intrigued by the final chapter, which, in the index, was headed `The future of the Liberal Party'. I thought, `This is a novelty&mdash;a book about the Liberal Party and talking about the future. Who could they get to write the last chapter of the book?' I could not think of anyone in the Liberal Party who talks about the future. Then I thought that maybe they would use someone in the recent past&mdash;yesterday's man, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)&mdash;or go back a bit further to Malcolm Fraser or perhaps even John Gorton. Then I got to the final chapter of the book and found that it was written by B.A. Santamaria! He has contributed to a book, edited by current Liberals, about the future of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the future of the Liberal Party? According to B.A. Santamaria&mdash;this relic from the museum of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s&mdash;the future of the Liberal Party is to oppose globalisation; to oppose women going to work; to oppose the money power, the good old theme about the banks they used to raise during the Great Depression; and to oppose the way in which people are moving off the land, the way in which people have left a simple agrarian lifestyle. What sort of future is this for the Liberal Party? What sort of future is there for the Liberal Party if it is opposed to globalisation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the editors, the member for Moore endorses opposition to internationalisation. Are you going to stop the information superhighway? Are you going to rip up the APEC agreement? Are you going to stop the internationalisation of the Australian economy and go back to `Santa's' old way of simple agrarian people working the land trying to get a wholesome heart and soul into their lifestyle? What sort of future is there for the Liberal Party when Santamaria talks about how bad it is that women are finding work and are finding equality in the labour force? It really is appalling. The idea about the money power is an echo in this place from the Great Depression, when Frank Anstey and some of the old-fashioned socialists of the time would rail about the money power backed by the bipartisan support of the old tories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we come to the crowning glory of the Liberal Party model for the future. It is back to the future; way back in time to the period when people lived out a simple agrarian lifestyle, tilling the soil that was good for their soul; going home late at night for three hours of Bible study; worrying about those rotten atheists and the rotten communists in far away parts of the world. All this is Santamaria's backward-looking, old-fashioned view about the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Moore is interjecting. You have got to be absolutely joking to commission a chapter in a book about the future of the Liberal Party and use Santamaria. It confirms everything that people on this side of the House say about members like you and those who lead you: that you have absolutely no conception and do not even have people of contemporary Australian relevance to write about the future of this nation and the future of your party. You are back to the rotten, burnt out Cold War mentality of burnt out figures like B.A. Santamaria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell you how relevant it is. The member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) is Santamaria's latest protege. You are bringing in the young fogies schooled at the feet of `Santa'; you are dragging out the old `Santa' to write the final chapter of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Heart of Liberalism</EMPHASIS>. Have I got news for you! There is no future; no future in `Santa'; no future in agrarian socialism; no future in opposing the entry of women to the labour force; no future in raising the old bogey about the money power; and, least of all, no future in this argument about people getting off the land. You have got to be absolutely joking. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to talk about the filthy corruption of the WA Inc. Western Australian Labor governments. I note the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) leaving the chamber. It was during his time as a state secretary of the ALP in Western Australia that we saw the most absolute corrupt behaviour on the part of a state government that has ever been seen in this country. It even eclipses some of the corrupt Labor governments or administrations from earlier in this century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me comment on the remarks made by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), one of whose predecessors was the most disastrous Prime Minister that this country has ever seen. Another of his predecessors was a member of Lang Labor&mdash;Mr Lazzarini. I mention that because, when he was lamenting or making this statement about the chapter written by B.A. Santamaria in the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Heart of Liberalism</EMPHASIS>, he forgot to mention that one of the very people who were bleating back to the Depression when referring to the world banks was one of his predecessors&mdash;the member for Werriwa in a past life&mdash;Mr Lazzarini, who had been a member of the Lang Labor group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jack Lang was a mentor to and a hero of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). In fact, it was the present Prime Minister who had Mr Jack Lang restored as a member of the ALP. Jack Lang had been expelled from the ALP because he had stood candidates against the official ALP candidates. So, when you come here and talk from the New South Wales right wing of the Labor Party about blasts from the past, you have got the blast from the past standing right at the dispatch box twice a week&mdash;when he is here for the days that he is on&mdash;on your behalf as the Prime Minister of Australia.
