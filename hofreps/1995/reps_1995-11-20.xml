<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>In February 1994, a review of the Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements said that there were allegations about the existence of networks of paedophiles operating in Australia and that the extent of the networks and their activities remained unknown. The review recommended that organised paedophile networks be added to the areas of major organised crime that the National Crime Authority was expected to focus on. The government accepted this recommendation. In December 1994, the committee agreed to conduct an inquiry into the extent to which organised paedophile networks had become established in Australia, and related matters such as the adequacy of police resources and the role of the National Crime Authority in tackling this area of criminal activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some extent, the conclusions reached on the scope of organised paedophile activity depend upon the breadth or narrowness of the definitions adopted for such key terms as `paedophile', `child pornography' and `organised networks'. These terms are used with widely varying definitions. For example, dictionaries define a paedophile as an adult who is sexually attracted towards children. Should `children' in this context be limited to prepubescent children or include those up to their mid-teens or even those up to 18?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found no consistent usage on this matter. Moreover, some distinguish between preferential and situational child sex offenders and regard only the former as paedophiles. Preferential offenders are those having a definite sexual preference for children. Situational offenders lack this preference but may offend against a child simply because the child is vulnerable and available at a time when an adult partner is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information presented to the committee was that most sexual offences against children are committed by their relatives and neighbours, who are not paedophiles in the strict sense of the term and do not operate in any organised or networked way. To the extent that two or more paedophiles group together to commit offences, the numbers involved have almost invariably been very small and the groupings very much ad hoc and on a peer-to-peer basis. More commonly, where there are contracts between paedophile offenders, they consist of loose informal networks of peer-to-peer contacts. The committee did not receive any evidence that organised paedophile groups and networks have ever resembled in size, aims, structures, methods or longevity the organised crime groups which provide the main focus for the NCA's work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee did not receive evidence of any commercial production of illegal child pornography in Australia. Most of the current illegal material that undoubtedly is possessed by many paedophiles appears to be made by them, obtained by the informal trading of homemade material amongst paedophiles assisted by informal networking or obtained from overseas. There is no evidence of the organised promotion or arrangement of tours by Australian paedophiles to overseas destinations known to be attractive to them. However, informal networking among paedophiles may assist some tourists going overseas to commit paedophile offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of evidence on the nature and extent of organised paedophile activity, the committee found it necessary to make only limited recommendations for change. The committee considered it essential that any focus by law enforcement agencies on organised paedophilia is not at the expense of resources devoted to the majority of cases of child sexual abuse. While, clearly, paedophile networking should not be ignored, an overemphasis on it risks distracting community attention away from the majority of child sex offenders&mdash;the lone offenders who are all too frequently members of the same family or household as their victims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee noted that the National Crime Authority is due to complete its own strategic intelligence assessment of organised paedophile activity early in 1996. Mr Sherman, the authority chairperson, told the committee in August that if the authority's assessment matched the committee's he did not propose that the National Crime Authority stay around in that area creating a role for itself. The committee endorsed this view. It considered that, unless criminal paedophile activity can be shown to be organised in fairly extensive and sophisticated ways that span state-territory boundaries, there is no justification for bringing the National Crime Authority's particular expertise and powers to bear. The specialist units in state and territory police forces have experience, facilities and expertise in investigating child sexual assault that the NCA does not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In coming to this view, the committee recognised that there was scope for improvement in the way that the various police forces work together to deal with paedophile offenders. Police told the committee that cooperation amongst their forces was generally good. However, they agreed that there could be improvements. For example, the Australian Federal Police told the committee that the single most important issue in this area was the need for timely and effective exchange of information between forces. Accordingly, the committee recommended that the Australasian Police Ministers Council examine how this might best be achieved. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the tabling of this report by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. I will continue on from the remarks of the chairman, the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), because he had reached an important area in relation to the detection of child sex tourists overseas&mdash;in particular, the revelations in relation to the detection of child sex tourists under the legislation that was passed by this parliament about two years ago. Until the hearing of that evidence from the Australian Federal Police, there had not been one single prosecution of an Australian child sex tourist for that offence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were interested during the hearings to learn more about this. We heard from Commander Schramm of the Australian Federal Police, who made the point that the Thai police force has a total manpower of 300,000 personnel, yet there are only 10 Thai police officers working full time on paedophilia or paedophile related offences. That set the priority to a certain extent for the exercises involving the police liaison officers who are stationed in Thailand.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the arrangements between the Thai police and the Australian Federal Police, recommendation (v) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government takes steps to improve the arrangements . . . with a view to improving the detection and prosecution of Australian child sex tourists.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation (vi) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government take steps to ensure that all its personnel working overseas in countries believed to be attractive to visiting Australian paedophiles are made aware that any information that they happen to come across about the illegal activities of such paedophiles should be reported to the Australian Federal Police. The Committee further recommends that similar steps be taken in relation to the personnel of non-government aid and other organisations funded in whole or in part by the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation (vii) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government seek treaty relationships with the Cambodian and other South-East Asian Governments to assist in the detection and obtaining of evidence to enable the prosecution of Australians committing child-sex offences in those countries.</PARA>
<PARA>During the committee's hearings we heard evidence in Melbourne from representatives of World Vision of some dissatisfaction with the response they had received regarding complaints or information they had passed on to the Australian Federal Police. Likewise, from the Australian Federal Police Association we heard evidence that there was disquiet within the Australian Federal Police at the time of the allegations giving rise to those concerns&mdash;namely, allegations of child sex activity by Australians in Cambodia&mdash;that the Australian Federal Police had not undertaken on-site investigations at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those concerns bear investigation by those who have that particular responsibility. The committee saw fit to make the recommendations I have just mentioned in order to try to overcome the difficulties that are being encountered in relation to child sex tourism. I note there has now been one prosecution under the child sex tourism legislation. As a consequence, we hope that with the improved relations between the Australian Federal Police, law enforcement agencies and overseas law enforcement agencies these particular circumstances will improve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter of concern was evidence from the Australian Customs Service that they have virtually little to no opportunity of being able to detect child sex pornography that comes in on CD-ROMs. In other words, they do not have the resources or the wherewithal to be able to detect that type of material as it comes into Australia. As a consequence, we find that child sex pornography that arrives in Australia either on the Internet or on CDs, in the baggage of or with particular passengers, is virtually unable to be detected unless somebody can be identified as possessing it in a form identified as child sex pornography. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is obviously a concern. There are software packages that are available now to detect these things much earlier. Recommendation (iii) points out that the Minister for Justice should take steps to ensure that Australian law enforcement agencies contribute to and draw on the expertise and software tools of overseas law enforcement agencies. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>In the past, the joint standing committee has undertaken three inquiries into Australia's relations with countries in our immediate region. The report I have just tabled is the latest in this series and takes its place with the 1989 report on countries of the South Pacific, the 1991 report on relations with Papua New Guinea and the report on relations with Indonesia, tabled in 1993. This report then could be seen as a broadening of the committee's focus. While Thailand is not as close geographically to this country as PNG is, for example, as a mainland state in South-East Asia and an important member of both ASEAN and APEC Thailand is an important country for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's contacts with Thailand before the Second World War were not great but the relationship between the two peoples was given form and meaning because of the presence of Australian prisoners of war on the Burma-Thailand railway from 1942. It was suggested to the committee that post-1945 the bilateral relationship was at its peak but has since been allowed to decline somewhat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report makes 57 recommendations in a wide variety of areas and it is the committee's hope that they will add to the relationship. Having said that, I should add that members did not believe there were any problems between Australia and Thailand. I would like to congratulate the subcommittee chairman, the member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), whose interest in foreign affairs is well known, the subcommittee members and the secretariat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to endorse the remarks made by the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), and welcome the opportunity to add my comments on this report, which covers the most significant aspects of Australia's relations with Thailand. Because of the limited time available, I would like to focus on what I regard as a vital aspect of the inquiry&mdash;the need to maintain and strengthen Australia's relationship with Thailand through a better knowledge and understanding of the Thai culture, history and language and the pivotal role played by the National Thai Studies Centre in this regard. Despite the increasing importance of and opportunities for Australian investment in South-East Asia, there is an acute shortage of Australians who have a sufficiently well developed grasp of Asian languages, cultures and business methods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thailand not only plays a major economic and political role and has one of the fastest growing economies in South-East Asia but also is one of Australia's fastest growing export markets. This report examines the importance of Thai studies to the process of strengthening Australian-Thai relations and reviews the arrangements for teaching Thai studies in Australian educational institutions. It also highlights the consequences of the decision in March 1994 by the Council of Australian Governments to give priority to the study of only four Asian languages, not including Thai, in Australian schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The usefulness and relevance of Thai studies for Australians wishing to pursue business interests in Thailand are obvious, but business interests are not the only consideration. Greater availability of and participation in Thai studies will undoubtedly provide enormous benefits and advantages in regard to all facets of Australian relations with Thailand. That is why it is so important to ensure relatively small demand programs, such as Thai studies, remain viable. Funding support for these programs tends to be short term or project based rather than recurrent. Because they do not enjoy the same level of enrolment as some other Asian languages, they become very vulnerable if longer term funding support through the Commonwealth, state and territory education systems is not available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence from groups and individuals involved in the field of Asian or Thai studies and organisations such as the Australia-Thailand Business Council consistently argued for greater coordination of support at Commonwealth level to ensure that the limited funding available was being spent effectively. The committee heard differing views on preferred options for achieving long-term viability for Thai studies programs. However, some form of rationalisation in the number of secondary and tertiary academic institutions promoting Thai studies was a consistent theme. The need to encourage institutions with a proven record of successfully establishing links with the business community and other sources of sponsorship was also recognised as a significant factor, as was the advantage of locating teaching institutions close to large catchment areas capable of generating greater demand for Thai studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the committee's visit to Thailand in November 1994 the delegation learned of the high regard in which the work of the National Thai Studies Centre is held in that country and of the relatively low levels of financial support provided by the Commonwealth government and the Australian National University. Established in 1991 with `seed' funding from the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the NTSC performs a range of functions in addition to conducting an undergraduate course in Thai studies. For example, it also sponsors the annual Thailand update conferences and promotes the rationalisation of Thai language teaching through Australia. In fact, the NTSC is the only academic and public information centre in the world which is located outside but dedicated to contemporary studies of Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not generally appreciated that to some extent the NTSC operates as a de facto Australia-Thailand council. It is involved in non-language activities such as cultural exchanges, visits by prominent Thai nationals and production of current awareness publications. In this regard it fulfils a similar role to the bodies such as the Australia-China Council and the Australia-Indonesia Institute, which, unlike the NTSC, enjoyed guaranteed long-term funding and staffing support under the auspices of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Recognising these aspects of the NTSC's responsibilities and the relatively precarious nature of its funding support, the committee has reiterated its concerns expressed in the report of the visit to Thailand last year that uncertain funding levels threaten the continued existence of the centre and consolidation of its achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth funding for the NTSC over the next three years is unfortunately being curtailed and will cease altogether in 1997-98. Accordingly, we have again recommended that DEET examine the role of the NTSC and the funding support provided to ensure that it continues to operate under conditions no less favourable than those which have applied to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to express my support for the conclusions and recommendations in this report and to urge the government to respond positively to the many suggested strategies for maintaining and enhancing the Australian-Thai relationship, a relationship which will provide significant benefits for both nations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report on Australia's relations with Thailand is of significance. It is the latest in a series which began in 1989 with the tabling of a report on Australia's relations with the countries of the South Pacific. Since then, the committee's reports have examined our relations with Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. Given Thailand's important position in South-East Asia, its economic dynamism, our mutual attachment to openness and a pluralist democracy, and the wartime contacts between the two peoples, it was particularly appropriate to have examined this relationship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment on a number of aspects of this report, including industrial relations; Australia's development assistance to Thailand; the sale of Australian education to Thailand; the importance of alumni associations in Thailand for the future of the relationship; and, briefly, the work of the Thai-Australian association. In making these comments today, I would like to make one thing emphatically clear: this report does not set out to pass judgment on Thailand in any area. The relationship is too important and too good to be jeopardised by provocative statements or intrusive behaviour. Nevertheless, there are areas where Australia may, because of the longstanding relationship and a degree of expertise, be able to provide assistance. Occupational safety and fair labour standards are one area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thailand has commendable legislation in many fields, but implementation is faced with extremely swift industrialisation. The fire in the Hong Kong owned Kader toy factory in May 1993 was a dramatic indication of difficulties. The issues of sprinklers, fire exits and the presence of flammable material in stairs received international coverage. It is reported that 188 people died in the fire and that a further 469 were injured trying to escape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thailand last signed a convention of the International Labour Organisation in 1967. Its record in this area is comparable with all other South-East Asian nations. The committee has recommended that Thailand be encouraged to sign and ratify ILO conventions as a matter of priority and that Australia offers its assistance to Thailand in the  development of laws which are in accordance with the ILO conventions. If Thailand, and other South-East Asian countries for that matter, can be assisted in this process, there will be nationally supported standards which can be used as ways of improving working conditions. A worrying aspect in the region is the use of child labour, and this is one area where the application of ILO conventions would be of value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a specific industrial relations project which is worth mentioning briefly. Since February 1993, our development assistance program has funded a program called Australian support for ILO objectives in Asia, or ASILO. It provides advice and expertise to assist labour ministries, employer organisations and trade unions in a number of countries, including Thailand. Thailand has voluntarily involved itself in many ILO projects in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Phase 1 of this program will finish in December and phase 2 is planned to begin in 1996. It will last for four years. The committee has recommended its implementation, especially the emphasis on training in Australia. This is the sort of positive contribution that Australia can make to assist Thailand to remedy the defects in the training and education aspects of its industrial safety structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian involvement in this field is not limited to this sort of project. By the end of 1995 a tripartite working party, headed by the redoubtable honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), will have reported on labour standards in the Asia-Pacific region. The other members of this working party are the President of the ACTU; the National Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, Mr Allan Handberg; the Director of Marketing and Industrial Policy of the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures, Ms Narelle Kennedy; and Mr Alan Oxley of International Trade Strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of reference for this working party are very broad. While I will not bore honourable members by reading them out, it is clear that they do not seek to blame or single out particular countries for deficiencies in labour standards. Rather, they seek to emphasise the nature and effectiveness of current measures and those which could be taken to address these standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that Australia's reputation overseas is important and that this country is judged by the reputation that our companies have in other countries. In this context, it was reassuring to hear from the Thai trade union leaders who have been appointed to Thailand's Senate that we have a positive reputation as employers compared with some other investing nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian development assistance to Thailand amounted to some $44.9 million in the last financial year. Some of these funds were spent on behalf of organisations such as the Department of Industrial Relations through the ASILO program to which I have just referred. Other programs are funded through bodies such as the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, or ACIAR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the committee was supportive of our development assistance program to Thailand, it believes this program should be directed towards assisting in the solution of its problems. These include the underdevelopment of the north and north-east of the country, income and opportunity differences between Bangkok and the provinces, poverty alleviation and dealing with major HIV-AIDS problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thailand has made great economic progress over the last few years. It has introduced a development assistance program for its own neighbours. Its problems will not go away, so we are not suggesting the establishment of its program should lead to the cancellation of our projects. The committee does believe, however, that there should be an examination of Thailand's needs for development assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a significant educational connection with Thailand which earns revenue for various institutions. In December 1994 the Australian International Education Foundation was established to advise on the promotion of international education and training, and exchanges and recruitment of international students. During the inquiry, some concerns were expressed about the foundation's operations. The committee has therefore recommended a review of its effectiveness after the first year of its existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thais have been studying here since the Colombo Plan of the 1950s. Most seem to enjoy their time here and have positive memories and associations. There is therefore a reservoir of goodwill towards Australia among a group of people in Thailand which is now becoming quite important in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry we took a good deal of evidence which indicated that the Thais enjoy participating in alumni associations. It was also clear that Australia has, until recently, put too little effort into such bodies in Thailand, although particular institutions do have active chapters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee felt that it was unfortunate that this goodwill was not harnessed effectively. At the same time, we were conscious that administering an alumni scheme through the embassy would involve resources, which are scarce enough without additional programs to administer. We feel that alumni associations are vital ways of retaining Australian connections. Therefore, assessments need to be made of the staffing and other consequences of creating and maintaining an effective network in Thailand. We have therefore recommended a review of current arrangements for the support given to estimate the resources needed to maintain contact with graduates of Australian universities and to introduce an effective system as soon as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Defence Force has trained a significant number of Royal Thai Armed Forces personnel in this country. We have recommended that the Department of Defence also examine ways of building and maintaining an effective network in Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not possible for a report like this to reflect all the evidence, written and verbal, which was received during the inquiry. Nevertheless, the committee is grateful to those organisations and individuals who sent in submission and gave evidence. Without these contributions, this report would not have been produced. Similarly, the committee is thankful for the opportunity provided by the government of Thailand to have extensive discussions with their ministers, with advisers and with individuals and organisations. That part of the inquiry was certainly fundamental to its outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One organisation I would particularly like to mention is the Thai-Australian Association of New South Wales. Their submission provided a considerable amount of information about their activities, which include a language school for children and young people which is the largest Thai school in Sydney. Each year for the past 12 years the association has run a Loy Krathong celebration, which attracts significant interest. This association has now been operating for over 35 years and is a key Thai community body in the state of New South Wales. Without its contribution, made with minimal government funding, connections with the Thai community would be much less effective. May their work prosper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As always, the committee members owe a debt to the secretariat staff for their work on the report. Margaret Cahill, Peter McLay, Lesley Cowen, Tracy Bartrim, Joanne Towner and Patrick Regan all did their bit to put it together, and we thank them. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted that the federal parliament is receiving this report. To my mind, Thailand is important both as a nation within the ASEAN group and as our neighbour and also because of the countries which are its neighbours.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations in this report are addressed to that end. There are only two that I want to identify.

I would hope that at secondary and tertiary levels Thai studies can be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concerns the Australian-Thailand Chamber of Commerce in Bangkok, with which I was very impressed when we met them on our visit in 1994. It seems to me, however, that there is a difference between the political and commercial relationship. It is always important for us in Australia to remember that those in the business world who are on site in a country sometimes are not aware of the priorities and emphasis that Australia's relations with a particular country require. At the same time, if we are going to expand our relationship with a country we do rely very much on those who live and work there&mdash;in Thailand, in this instance. I commend many of them for the way in which they are committed to our relationship at a commercial and a personal level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal of the credit for this report goes to the subcommittee chairman, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson); to the chairman of the main committee, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price); and to Patrick Regan and each of the members of the staff of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. It is a worthwhile report. I very much commend its recommendations to the government. I think that, unless we can maintain a new emphasis on the relationship with Thailand, Australia will be the loser. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse very much the remarks that previous speakers, especially the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), have made on the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Australia and Thailand enjoy a good relationship. As Australia continues to see a role within Asia, this relationship will continue. There is a tremendous amount of goodwill in Thailand towards Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was part of the delegation that went to Thailand, and I have visited that country on a number of occasions. I have always been impressed with the amount of goodwill that exists in Thailand towards Australia. The committee believes that great opportunities exist in Thailand for Australian business, technology and expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as there are these opportunities, I hope that Australian businesses operating in Thailand will observe the correct industrial relations law. It would not be good for firms to go from Australia, where they are forced by law to adhere to certain industrial relations law, to Thailand and exploit the situation there. Australian firms operating in Thailand have a responsibility to operate&mdash;especially when it comes to occupational health and safety&mdash;as they would in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year, 1996, is a very important year in Thailand. In June it will be the Golden Jubilee of His Majesty the King's accession to the throne. Indeed, the first recommendation that the committee made is that the Australian government appropriately recognise this. It is important that our longstanding relationship with Thailand and the goodwill that has existed between the two countries be recognised. Just as many countries contributed to our celebrations in 1988, it is important that this most significant event in Thailand be appropriately recognised in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue that the committee dealt with, which I would like to comment on, is piracies in the waters not only off Thailand but in the area of South-East Asia. I believe that Australia could do more to assist Thailand to combat piracy in South-East Asian waters. I note that AMSA regards this as a matter just for the International Maritime Organisation and has said that it has no part in Australian-Thai relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it does have a part, because piracy is on quite a significant increase and it does pose a danger to Australian shipping. As it is a crime against humanity, it is regarded seriously under international law. I believe all nations have an obligation to assist in stamping out piracy. I do not think it is enough for us to expect the nations of South-East Asia to deal with this problem on their own. I think we can be of considerable assistance and we should do more to assist in stamping out piracy in this part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other speakers have alluded to the good relationship between Australia and Thailand. Good relationships are like family relationships: they do not just happen; they need working on. We cannot ignore the relationship and just expect it to continue. We will have our hiccups every so often in the relationship but, hopefully, the relationship is mature enough to sustain that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are great benefits to be accrued from both countries. We can assist the Thais and indeed they can assist us. One of the ways we can better expand relationships is through cultural exchanges. I have long felt that politics, political debate and trade are all very important in bringing revenue to the countries concerned, but there is often so much that can be gained through cultural exchanges and cultural visits between the two countries. I would like to see an increase in that area of our relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like others, I would like to pay tribute to the secretarial staff of the main committee, but especially to the secretariat of the subcommittee. Patrick Regan, who acted as the secretary throughout, did a sterling job and is to be commended. I think this report will become an important work for study for those interested in Australia's relationship with Thailand, one of our most important neighbours.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sydney Airport Curfew Amendment Bill, which I have just presented to the House, is similar to a bill that was enacted into law by the parliament some weeks ago, with one important addition&mdash;that is, the bill I have just presented to the parliament includes a provision to reopen the east-west runway at Sydney airport. Of course that particular provision and that commitment goes to the nub of the continuing debate surrounding the operation of Sydney airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House will remember that some months ago I presented a private member's bill to entrench into law the curfew that had operated at Sydney airport for many years. The government initially decided not to support that bill but, rather, to refer it to the Morris committee. I foreshadowed an amendment proposing the reopening of the east-west runway. The Morris committee returned the bill with a recommendation that some changes be made to the curfew hours, accommodating what are known as shoulder flights. That measure, with the support of the opposition but minus the provision in relation to the east-west runway, was then passed by this House and by the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of an opposition, not a government, initiative, the existing curfew at Sydney airport has now been entrenched in law, and that is a point that needs to be recorded. Despite the government having been in office for 13 years and despite all the rhetoric about sensible policies for Sydney airport, it took an opposition initiative through a private member's bill to incorporate and entrench into law the curfew arrangements at Sydney airport. But, more important than that, the measure now presented to the parliament proposes that the east-west runway be reopened. That is the colloquial description of resuming what might loosely be called `normal' operations of the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past couple of months this debate about sharing the burden of noise at Sydney airport has continued very strongly rather than abated. It has continued very strongly because the case argued by those who are now carrying all of the noise burden is a just case and their case has been supported in the past couple of months from three very significant sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House will recall that the argument of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) is that it is unsafe to reopen the east-west runway. That proposition has been directly repudiated by three absolutely impeccable sources. The first of those was a Mr Bell, a safety consultant, who was engaged by the Labor government several years ago to give advice on safety matters. He said that&mdash;far from the operation of the east-west runway in company with one of the north-south runways being unsafe&mdash;the danger of accidents from operating the two parallel runways was greater than the use of intersecting runways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second was from Mr Pollard, the recently appointed head of Airservices Australia, who, in an inaugural interview from America on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program, said that intersecting runways operated all over the world and there was absolutely no safety problem with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and most significant was the evidence given by United States Aviation Consultancy before the Senate committee. In that committee hearing, Flight Transportation Associates said that there was absolutely no evidence that operating intersecting runways was in any way less safe than operating parallel runways. In fact, some of the evidence presented indicated that there was greater safety in the operation of intersecting runways in the circumstances at Sydney than in the operation of the parallel runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So you have three sources, the government safety consultant, the new head of Airservices and Flight Transportation Associates, once again demolishing the Brereton argument, demolishing the government's argument and proving yet again what a blatant political fit-up the closure of the east-west runway has always been and what disgraceful discrimination it represents for the residents under the north-south flight path out of Sydney airport. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)calls on the Trade Practices Commission to ensure that its recommendations will not reduce the service provided by these family businesses. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that this motion will have bipartisan support. The motion is self-explanatory. It goes to the issue of the newsagency system and the way distribution operates throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me provide some background to this matter. In 1979 the authorisation of newsagency systems was supported by the Fraser government and the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs at the time, the Hon. Wal Fife. It is fair to say that this was not the preferred system of the Trade Practices Commission. In its 1979 draft determination on a request for authorisation by New South Wales publishers in 1978, the commission proposed to refuse authorisation on the basis that the anti-competitive elements of the system did `not result in any benefit to the public'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fraser government was quoted in the newspapers as saying that the widespread availability of newspapers and magazines and the low cost home delivery service were the principal public benefit arising from the system. As a result of the intervention of the Fraser government, the authorisation process went ahead. In 1982, the Trade Practices Commission granted the Victorian authorisation based on considerations similar to those applying in New South Wales. As a result, we have had a system in place for a number of years that has worked very successfully in the distribution of newspapers throughout this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the late 1980s and into the early 1990s, the Trade Practices Commission looked at this issue, releasing a discussion paper on it with a view to possibly revisiting the whole process of distribution and authorisation. On 3 August 1993 the commission brought down a determination. As part of that determination, the Trade Practices Commission said that it had:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . authorised this arrangement, which may otherwise be in breach of the competition law, because the commission believes the public benefits of a low-cost, guaranteed and timely service to readers outweighs the anti-competitive effects of a delivery monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA>As a result, the Trade Practices Tribunal in November 1994 came out with a response, setting aside the authorisation. The tribunal said that the commission's decision would have the effect of patching up a system that was ripe for change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, hundreds&mdash;not tens but hundreds&mdash;of people who operate newsagencies around this country and who have been trying to sell them for very valid reasons, including health concerns, financial difficulties and family breakdowns, find that they cannot sell their newsagencies. For example, in Victoria, a newsagency worth over $900,000 was sold for somewhere in the order of $500,000. That is a pretty reasonably sized newsagency when you compare it with others and the price tags they have on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that people who are in business&mdash;these are small business people, the people we should be supporting&mdash;are being affected by the lack of quick decisions and determinations through the tribunal approval system. We should be looking to people like newsagents to lead a recovery in this country rather than handicapping and creating difficulties for them. I would like to read from a letter sent to me by an 80-year-old gentleman in my electorate, raising the issue of newsagencies with me. The letter is self-explanatory. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Atkinson,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you because I am worried that the home delivery service I enjoy from my local newsagency might be closed down if decisions in Canberra result in so-called "deregulation".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am 80 years old, I am mostly stuck at home and I don't have the energy I once had to walk miles for a newspaper. I asked for home delivery for exactly this reason. If I had to walk to get a paper, I'd either run out of breath half way or it would take so long that I reckon I'd decide it just wasn't worth the effort every day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People might say `what would someone my age care about the news anyway'. I don't care how old I am, I still want to know what's going on in the world. Even if I can't read every word of every story in the paper, I like to keep in touch.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I couldn't get The Sun delivered to my home every day, I'd end up like most people. I'd get my news from the TV or the radio. Well, I think TV is great if all you want is a summary, you love animal stories, you're mad on sport and you care what the weather's going to be tomorrow (as if they're ever right). Radio is even worse, out of five minutes news, one or two minutes are sport and weather. I might be old-fashioned, but if I want to know the weather I just look outside. I want the sort of news and comment that Terry McCrann gives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please don't let these people in Canberra destroy a service that I value and which gives so much enjoyment for so little cost. I've already seen what happened to home deliveries of milk and bread, they're "gone with the wind". The banks have been complete mongrels since they were "deregulated"; it seems service is a thing of the past. I would not like to see newspaper deliveries go the same way.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to get into arguments about the banks or other issues related to that, but let me just say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there is a problem with this process. When you look at the newsagency system and the way in which it is structured, and I have spoken to a number of these people now, you find they are prepared to get out and provide a service to the handicapped, to those with difficulties or to those who are sick in our communities. In fact, a number of newsagents actually go out on a regular basis and collect their money from these people because the people cannot get to the newsagencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we need to look a lot more closely at this process as there are something like 4,500 newsagents in this country. The system of distribution that we have at the moment works. These people are contracted to have the newspapers delivered on to the doorsteps of people by 6.45 in the morning. That is not an easy task. You could describe newspapers as perishable&mdash;they are probably more perishable than tomatoes&mdash;because by midday a newspaper is out of date and you have afternoon newspapers coming in. So it is important to get these papers delivered quickly. When you have to get them out by truck from the centre where they are produced, from the offices of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, to the newsagents, it is a pretty decent-sized job to distribute them to 4,500 newsagents around the country. When you add to that the 25,000 subagents around the country, one might ask, `How do they do it?' The answer is, `By providing the sort of service that is provided at the moment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Newsagents are able to put together a range of newspapers so they can deliver them in one hit, which means we are getting a financial advantage in the delivery process. If we allow the 7-Elevens or some of the convenience stores such as Shell shops or other shops at petrol stations to have this service, I would be interested to see whether they would be prepared to carry the full range of papers that newsagents carry. Would they be prepared to carry, for example, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Simply Living</EMPHASIS> or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Social Alternatives</EMPHASIS> newspapers? There are lots of questions that could be asked here. I think the simple answer is that they want to get into it to earn the big quid out of the big volume newspapers. But, when it comes to providing a service across the board, not on your nelly&mdash;you won't see it, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am asking people in Australia, particularly members of this House, to get behind the newsagents. Sure, they might have concerns about the monopolistic approach to it, but they are getting a delivery on time and at a charge they will not get anywhere else. As Mr Johnson, the 80-year-old man said, newspapers will go the same way as bread and milk if we let this fall over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I for one get the newspaper delivered in the morning. I am quite happy to sit in my pyjamas reading it with a cup of coffee.

I am sure that not one person in the gallery would disagree with the comments he has made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have attended Labor Party meetings for 34 years; served as an alderman for 15 years, including the three during which I was mayor; and been a member of the federal parliament for 11 years. During that time I have had drawn to my attention a couple of million problems and complaints from all around Australia. I have received complaints about banking, dogs, feral cats, potholed streets, teachers, doctors, lawyers, chemists, policemen, car salesmen, Australia Post, Telstra, hospitals, the taxation department, bus companies, railways, aeroplane noise, petrol prices, politicians&mdash;and even mothers-in-law. But surprise, surprise: not once have I heard a complaint about the system used for the distribution of newspapers and magazines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had my own complaint once with a newsagent; he used to fail to deliver my newspaper in time for me to read it while I was having breakfast. But that was a complaint due to individual weakness; it was not a complaint about a distribution system which works beautifully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there we have it, members: a system which works brilliantly&mdash;and the commission wants to change it. Never in the history of humankind has there been a more stupid repudiation of the long treasured maxim, `if she ain't broke, don't fix it.' We have a system which is as near to perfection as any ever devised: a system which ensures an efficient and low cost home delivery of newspapers and magazines. Why the hell would we want to change it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission&mdash;that is, the old Trade Practices Commission&mdash;chaired still by Professor Allan Fels, has quite clearly become too obsessed with abstract competition theory. It has become overexuberant in its desire to initiate a better deal for consumers. The commission is barking up the wrong tree. Instead of reducing prices for consumers, it is all set to put in place changes which will be quite detrimental to consumers. Instead of bringing in a better system for the sale and delivery of newspapers and magazines, the commission will, through revoking or modifying the current authorisations, leave newsagency and public arrangements in turmoil, in total disarray. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going in to bat for newsagents or publishers; I am not going in to bat for the general public. I say: let the public decide&mdash;not the commission. Let the public decide the type of change and the pace of change which is to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that changes to newsagency arrangements have been taking place for some time. We all know that many retailing operations now carry a wide range of material which previously was carried only by newsagents, and that newsagents themselves have broadened their sales of non-traditional goods and services. However, these changes are occurring at an acceptable pace&mdash;a pace resulting from consumer tastes and habits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission, in trying to direct consumer demand, is acting unacceptably; it would be far wiser to go with the flow. The commission has no reason to pat itself on the back over the disorder which has flowed from changes to the authorisation system in Canberra. Direct delivery of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> has had a catastrophic effect on Canberra's 60 or so newsagencies. Consumers are receiving a small reduction in the cost of their newspaper, but the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> practice is bulldozing small businesses throughout the national capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The method of delivery of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> is having a detrimental effect not just on newsagencies but on other businesses in shopping centres which used to have a newsagency. Many suburban shopping centres are in serious decline because of the loss of their newsagency. One would have thought that the local newspaper would be supporting local businesses, not damaging them. Once again&mdash;surprise, surprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite direct delivery by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, the circulation of that paper has shown no increase&mdash;absolutely zilch increase. What has happened in Canberra will happen in other cities, in regional centres throughout Australia and in country towns in particular if the commission changes the system in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. The pursuit of abstract competition theory will end up destroying the small businesses which operate in shopping centres. Imagine the situation as these big monopoly businesses take over. I read, I think, in the Sunday paper Alan Jones&mdash;I do not always agree with Alan Jones; as a matter of fact, very rarely&mdash;say that, if this madness continues, the little guy will be squeezed out. A shopping centre which now might have 20 shops will have Woolworths at one end, Coles at the other end and nothing in between. That is where we are heading if some of these mad principles of rationalisation are put into practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this situation eventuates, as it undoubtedly will, unless Allan Fels and his commission see good commonsense, we will not be able to buy those magazines which many of us seek to buy because the only publications that Woolworths, Coles and the big establishments will take are those which have a great demand, and whose sales turn over quickly. If you have an interest which may not be shared by an overwhelming majority of Australians, you will not be able to get those small publications which you can currently get from your local newsagents. That to me would be a great shame because we would be discouraging the widest possible availability of information. The coverage of information and critical comment are vital in a democratic society such as Australia. Rather than allowing the commission to abolish public benefits, we should be insisting that they be maintained because we know one thing: the open market is dictated by the pursuit of profits. We just will not get these smaller publications through the open market system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many home delivery customers, as the honourable member for Isaacs mentioned, are housebound due to old age, failing health, disability, illness, or something of that nature. As the member for Isaacs said, they are not going to be able to walk to the corner shop, they have not got a car in which they can shoot off to the supermarket and they need their home delivery. If newsagents and the home delivery system are not allowed to continue, people will be denied access to that information. The commission wants to see the loss of home delivery in areas which are simply uneconomic to service. This is absolute madness. It is significant that all speakers today from different sides of the political fence are concerned about social factors and not economic theory. No doubt the commission would favour the abolition of Australia Post mail deliveries. People in the Hunter do not want to see the loss of their newsagents and home delivery. I am sure the constituents of other electorates throughout Australia feel the same way. </PARA>

There are a couple of remarks made by the previous speaker, the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon)&mdash;although he and I often disagree on many issues&mdash;that I agree with. I have a similar view about Alan Jones but, more importantly, he made a comment about Canberra. My understanding from my colleague the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Smyth), who sits on my left, is that where the distribution has been affected in this town it has had a flow-on effect not only to the newsagents but also to many of the other businesses in the shopping strips because foot traffic is not being generated to the newsagencies and other businesses suffer as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion that is before us calls on the TPC to finalise its review in this area. It draws attention to the importance of the goodwill built up in the family businesses and it calls on the commission to ensure that its recommendations will not reduce service provided by those businesses. One of the things the newsagents themselves have done, as I understand it, has been to organise a parachute drop out the front today to deliver some 25,000 petition signatures to this parliament. I think it is important that we take every means possible to draw to the attention of the nation this particular issue, which is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are slightly different rules, as I understand it, between states. In Victoria we have had a couple of reviews&mdash;in 1982 and again in 1983. Now we have this current review by the TPC or what is now called the ACCC. The essence of the argument, as I understand it, is that publishers agree to deliver only to certain authorised newsagents in prescribed territories who, in turn, use subagents. The proposal being looked at is that there should be no guaranteed territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the brief time I have I would like to read from a letter I received from one of my local newsagents Mountain Gate in my electorate, covering the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. My local newsagent says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For over 100 years newsagents have played a vital role in the social and commercial fabric of the local community. In an era of giant supermarkets and chain stores, we are one of the last remaining bastions of family owned and operated retail businesses, offering traditional friendly and personal service to our customers.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to talk about the matters that previous speakers have raised; the importance of home delivery; the fact that it costs about 50c a week, or 8c or 9c a day, to get your papers delivered; and the number of people who are affected. There are social as well as economic implications. I think it is important that we understand the vital role local newsagencies play in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the TPC is trying to tell us is that the current arrangements are outdated; that others, such as convenience stores, should have the same treatment; that newsagents often operate to disadvantage some of the subagents and they need some competition; and that there is no evidence overseas to show that exclusive territory gives a particular consumer benefit. Let me say that, if other things were changed by this government in terms of making small business more profitable, then maybe you could run that rationalist line. But the coalition has a very clear perspective on where it stands on this position: to support the continuation of the current system of distribution for newspapers and magazines with one accredited newsagent for a particular territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe this system provides a significant public benefit in its provision of a low-cost efficient home delivery service for daily morning newspapers as well as facilitating the widespread availability of a broad range of publications. The coalition recognises that successful small business enterprises such as newsagencies are the base from which our national recovery must be built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, it is important that newsagents have an opportunity to protect their investment. Many of them&mdash;for example, my local newsagent in his letter, which is too lengthy for me to read in the time I have&mdash;talk about the investment not only in people, family and skills but also in the new technology, the new equipment, they have introduced with the expectation that under the present system it will bear fruit. To take that out from under them is incorrect. It does not provide the right service for the community. It is something which I would object to, as would most of my colleagues in this House. I very strongly commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) for the motion now before the House. I, like many members on both sides of the House, have been contacted by our local newsagents with their concerns at what the TPC might do in this area. In the course of those discussions, many interesting perspectives have been demonstrated to us by those newsagents and family businesses, perspectives which many of us would have not understood in this area. I will not canvass all the arguments that have been raised here by honourable members before me. But, when we look at these sorts of issues, we see that there are inherent dangers in a competition policy that does not pay due attention to the benefits that customers will receive from any changes to existing policy and, indeed, any impact on the structure of small business in this country&mdash;in this case, the newsagents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my contribution here today, I would like to add a few words on the effects that any adverse TPC ruling might have on customers and on local economies. As far as customers are concerned, I think it is fair to say that the newsagents' network in this country provides very good customer service. There are very few businesses in business today that are as able to home deliver in such a cost-efficient manner as newsagents are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, more importantly, newsagencies tend to be a focus of social activity in local shopping centres as well as a focus of economic activity. When you talk to newsagents, they tell you about people who make their one daily trip down to the newsagents to have their social contact for the day and to chew over the problems of the district with the newsagent. For those people who invariably walk to the newsagents&mdash;and they are older people&mdash;there is also a considerable health and welfare benefit that flows from the fact that there is a familiar face in the shopping centre, that they do have to walk to get there, and the social discourse that takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As far as the newsagents are concerned, they have purchased their businesses on the premise that certain structures might endure. We all know that things do not last forever; nevertheless, these people have invested their life savings in businesses that really rely on the existing network arrangements. It is very important that these sorts of factors are taken into account by the TPC in its deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I now move to elements of the local economy. I have been informed by newsagents in my electorate of Corio that there are some 33 newsagencies in Geelong and surrounding districts, and 31 one of those are located in strip centres&mdash;in very localised shopping districts. I do not think we ought to underestimate the impact that an adverse TPC ruling will have not only on the newsagents concerned but also on the ancillary businesses that occupy these shopping centres. Apart from the supermarket, the newsagent is the one other critical business that does attract people down to the strip. Not everybody who goes out every day buys food but, if they are into a ritual, they invariably do buy a newspaper, and some of their spending occurs in the other businesses in the centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Geelong region the newsagents employ 356 people, a sizeable business if you take it collectively. When we look at regional economies, we find that there is unlikely to be employment growth in the public sector and there will not be substantial employment growth in the big private companies. The only other area of growth is in small businesses like the newsagents. As you can see from the figures that I have quoted, they are significant employers in the Geelong region. I commend the motion to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)acknowledges that many country towns have either no doctor or an inadequate number of doctors to service their needs despite making every effort to attract doctors to their towns;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)believes that, despite initiatives undertaken to make rural medicine more attractive to both undergraduates and graduates, the acute shortage of country doctors remains and will continue for at least some years;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)recommends that in normal circumstances no overseas doctors be given temporary residence permits to fill positions of doctor shortage in Australia in preference to willing Australian citizens who have appropriate qualifications; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)calls on the Government to re-examine and renegotiate the arrangement whereby unlimited numbers of surplus New Zealand doctors are registered to work in Australia unless they are prepared to work in areas of shortage, especially while Australian university entrance numbers have to be cut to accommodate this inflow.</PARA>
<PARA>I particularly want to highlight in this debate the lack of medical doctors in many country towns, particularly remote area towns, and also put forward a possible solution to overcome the short-term shortage of these doctors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us in this parliament would appreciate what is happening in country towns and the difficulty we have in getting doctors. Doctor shortages arise in one town, which with a great deal of effort are solved, then the shortage bobs up in another town. It seems to be an ongoing problem which is getting worse. In fact, in some towns of some size in my electorate there is no doctor at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will start by quoting some background figures. Over the last 10 years we have had an increase of 12,000 doctors in Australia in total. The latest figures for the end of the 1994-95 financial year show that there were 39,812 doctors in Australia, which is roughly one doctor per 450 of the population&mdash;a very high level indeed. Some would say we have an excess of doctors in this country, but we have a maldistribution of those doctors. We have an oversupply overall, but we particularly have an oversupply in the city areas and a dearth in country areas. I think that needs to be stated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also probably appreciate the reasons why doctors do not like going to country areas. In many cases they are on their own and do not have backup, particularly from big hospitals, as they do in the cities. They find it very difficult to get relief from the constant 24-hour work when they are on call all the time. They find it very difficult to get locums so that they can get holidays. In many cases they have little or no peer support for the responsible work that they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Insurance costs are driving obstetricians out of country towns. Doctors' families do not like living in these towns because the spouses of the doctors are often professionals themselves and they cannot find jobs. Also, it is believed, though I do not believe it is always the case, they can make more money in the city areas. Of course, the dedicated doctors that do go to country towns now find that when all this is thrown in they burn out after two or three years and leave the town and the town cannot get a replacement doctor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in recent times a national rural health strategy has been put in place, which has given money incentives for doctors to practise in rural areas. Professional support, support for the families, training for the doctors, relief for the doctors and also an upgrading of facilities and equipment are also being offered. While that is welcome, sadly it is not solving the problem, certainly not in the short term, though I believe it will have some impact in the medium to long term. The success of that program, welcome though it is, is quite limited. Of course, on top of that, many shires are looking to expand the Newcastle university model and also to offer things like scholarships to students from rural areas to go to university to become doctors in the hope that they will be more inclined to come back to country areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime in areas of need, particularly remote areas, we still have this shortage of doctors. Towns can advertise, at great expense, until they are blue in the face. I know that Trangie, a little town in my electorate, spent $10,000, which is a lot of money for that town, advertising for a doctor before it got one. Fewer and fewer numbers of Australian doctors are going to these towns. It is an enormous problem overall. Some towns in my electorate do not have a doctor at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate, based on Dubbo and Broken Hill, is the largest in New South Wales, taking in 40 per cent of the state. A number of towns in my electorate are in dire need of medical services. I will just run through some of the towns to give the House some idea of the problem. Dubbo has a population of nearly 38,000 people and has 43 doctors. On the Australian average of one doctor to approximately every 500 people, Dubbo should have 76 doctors. Parkes has a population of 10,000 people and has seven general practitioners when it probably should have 20 doctors if it had the Australian average. Forbes is a town with a population of 8,500 people and is in dire need of more doctors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broken Hill has a population of about 23,000 people and has 16 doctors when it should have well in excess of 30. Cobar has a population of 5,500 people and was down to one doctor at one stage. However, Cobar now has three doctors following a massive effort by the council to attract two further doctors to the town. However, on the Australian average the town should have 11 doctors. Condobolin, which was down to one doctor, now has two doctors and, hopefully, another one will be starting next month. With a population of 3,500 people Condobolin probably should have seven doctors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lake Cargelligo has a population of about 1,250 people and has just secured another doctor&mdash;welcome news&mdash;because the sole doctor in the town was suffering from burn-out and was just about to chuck it in. Bourke and its surrounds has a population of 4,300 people and has three general practitioners when it should have eight. Nyngan, with a population of 2,500 people, has two general practitioners when it should have five. Narromine has a population of 3,500 people and has three general practitioners when it should have seven. Brewarrina has a population of 1,500&mdash;2,200 when you take in the whole shire because it covers a vast area&mdash;and has only one doctor. The town is in some danger of losing the doctor and will end up with none when it should have three or four. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Warren has a shire population of 3,000 and has only two GPs when it should have six. Wilcannia is a town of 1,000 people, 85 per cent of whom are Aborigines, and does not have a doctor at all. The town has not had a doctor for years when it should have at least two doctors. Wilcannia, White Cliffs, Ivanhoe, Tibooburra and Menindee have no doctors and can only be serviced by the Royal Flying Doctor Service. I am very grateful for that service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a pen portrait of my electorate. No doubt other country members could tell a similar story. When Australian doctors will not go to these towns the federal government will allow doctors from overseas into the country on temporary visas for periods of one or two years to fill these areas of need. That is very welcome and it has worked reasonably well. I know of the role those people have played with the Royal Flying Doctor Service in my own electorate in filling those positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have something like 700 Australian citizens who have received medical training overseas but who cannot obtain registration in this country. It seems odd to me that doctors who are Australian citizens, who speak English well and who, in most cases, meet the necessary Australian qualifications, cannot be registered here in preference to foreign doctors. It seems to be a crazy situation, particularly when many of these people are willing, if registered, to go out to these remote towns and practise. They would be willing to sign on the dotted line, or whatever it takes, and undertake to stay there for five years, 10 years, or more. I believe the government should give preference to those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand doctors are pouring into this country as a result of the oversupply in their own country. They have no restriction placed upon them whatsoever. Those doctors are going to urban areas rather than to remote country areas. This is another area which urgently needs looking at. I stress to the government that it should be looking to register overseas trained doctors who are Australian citizens and who meet the Australian qualifications so that they can go out and practise in country areas where they are desperately needed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All Australians should have equity of access to medical services, but they don't. Rural doctors now face the greatest maldistribution of the medical work force ever experienced in peacetime Australia. Rural communities of up to 3,000 people have not had a general practitioner for two or three years and there are more than 500 vacancies in rural practice. I saw a cartoon drawing the other day which showed a road sign on a road which meandered through a country village. The road sign read, `Last GP for 2,000 kilometres.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one would disagree that the maldistribution of medical practitioners in Australia is tragic and intolerable, but one would be wrong to believe that the problem is one of recent origin. Rural communities have become doctorless increasingly over the past 50 years and coalition governments did nothing to reverse the trend. Now the coalition, particularly the National Party, is trying to gain political advantage from the shortage of family medical services in rural Australia. It is working on the principle that country people have short memories and will believe that the shortage of rural GPs has developed only since 1983 and as a result of the policies of the dreadful Labor Party. In fact, the opposite is true, as I will point out later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales Farmers Association Vice-President, John Cobb&mdash;possibly a relative of the National Party's Mr Michael Cobb, the member for Parkes, who moved the motion which is before the House&mdash;has called for a dramatic shift in government policy to alleviate the shameful shortage of doctors in rural areas. I know the dramatic shift envisaged by Mr John Cobb is not intended to take us back to the days of Menzies, Fraser and company when there were no policies and zilch expenditure to correct the shortage of medical services in sparsely isolated areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two Mr Cobbs are not alone in their concern about the unequal distribution of Australia's medical work force. Three or four million Australians, including this speaker, are equally concerned. People who have the greatest understanding of this problem and know just how complicated it is will agree that a solution will be more speedily achieved if political parties work in charitable cooperation rather than try to score cheap political points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this folder&mdash;for all to see&mdash;is a host of research publications addressing the shortage of medical services in rural areas. All this research was undertaken during a period of Labor government. I do not want to play the political game so I will make this my last partisan point: these publications cover policy, projects and expenditure to attract doctors to rural practice. Go to any library&mdash;go to every library&mdash;and you will find no evidence of comparable policy, projects and expenditure undertaken by coalition governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons why doctors are reluctant to practise in the bush are well documented. But how to get them to practise in rural communities is tremendously complex and cannot be answered adequately in the short time available. Members will know that very few school leavers from country areas gain entry to medical school. So city graduates do their internship in major hospitals in the city and do not set up their shingle in unfamiliar rural environments. Doctors can earn more money in the city with more patients, lower medical defence insurance premiums, a better chance of mum getting a job, better access to parents and relatives, better educational opportunities for the kids and more leisure and family time for the doctor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most city GPs do no procedural work and lack the confidence and technical competence to do anaesthetics, obstetrics and surgery. In Australia we have doctors trained in New Zealand and other countries as well as full fee-paying overseas students graduating from Australian medical schools. Mr Cobb and others suggest that such people could somehow be bonded to serve the qualifying period in country practice. But such schemes have not worked, will not work and cannot work because in this country civil conscription and discriminatory practices are not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find that overseas trained doctors who come to Australia say they will go to country areas and become accredited but they stay in the country only a short while. They want to drift back to the cities where their own people congregate. It sounds all right, but it does not work. The best we can do, as we have learned from the USA and Canada, in tackling this problem is develop more flexible and innovative selection, training and working arrangements, and employ strategies to increase the number of rural based GPs and specialists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are doing all the above things, and more, and we are doing them darned well, particularly since the 1992 budget when $25 million annually was allocated to the rural incentives program to improve the access of rural Australians to general practice services. We are using affirmative action pathways to get more rural students into medical schools. Until 1991 or 1992 virtually nothing was done but now a Labor government has concentrated its efforts on trying to get medical services into rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In association with medical professional bodies we have designed special training programs in rural medicine. People with medical skills, from all universities in all states, are cooperating splendidly. Pilot programs are being run. Medical students are spending more time in rural areas as part of their training. RMOs are being seconded to positions in rural areas. Technology is being introduced to reduce professional isolation of rural doctors. Specialist training places are being established in major rural centres across Australia, and pilot schemes for specialist medical services delivery are being established in rural and remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding from bodies such as the rural incentives program has transformed the focus on rural and remote area health and the imbalance in the distribution of the medical work force is being better addressed than ever before. The media report that Mr John Cobb and the National Farmers Federation have welcomed many of the schemes being implemented. They realise, as we all should realise, that 1991-92 was not so many years ago. This solution to the problem of the lack of medical service in remote Australia will not be solved quickly. The neglect which went on for so many years will take time to overcome. It will take a long time and it will cost a motza. This government is determined to pursue every possible strategy so all Australians will have equity of access to health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are moving as fast as is humanly possible; we are spending a fortune trying to get doctors in rural areas. The strategies that we have adopted are as a result of widespread consultation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion of the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), and I congratulate and thank him for bringing this extremely important matter to the notice of the federal parliament. As the member for Parkes has pointed out, the dearth of doctors and other health professionals is certainly endemic to most parts of rural Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in the contribution of the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). It is obvious that he has an understanding of the shortage because he lives in a rural area, but I point out to him that the present government has been in office for 13 years now. He mentioned 1991-92, at which time Labor had been in government for 10 years. During that period, the situation had grown worse. So it certainly took a long while for the government to realise that there was a problem in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the establishment of the national rural health strategy by the federal government. I know it will take time to implement. Even with this strategy in place, I think we are still going to have major problems. I think governments really have to make some strong decisions if they are going to provide proper health care by health professionals in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my many years in the federal parliament, health care has been one of the most pressing problems in the Riverina electorate. Although some recent positive moves have been made to try to overcome the problem in the long term, I have my doubts about the outcomes. The member for Parkes mentioned a number of towns in his electorate in which there is a shortage of doctors, and I could do the same for my electorate. I will not go over that, except to say that the situation gets worse day by day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is extremely complex. One of the impediments to progress is that under the present health care regime a medical practitioner can nail his shingle up just about anywhere in urban Australia and make a reasonable living. The member for Hunter alluded to that. Why, then, would a health professional leave the coast and the surf, the Opera House and theatre, his or her fellow professionals and their backup tertiary learning institutions, and their opportunity to keep up with the latest health and medical developments, to move to rural Australia where he or she can expect to tend patients with every known malady for 24 hours a day, nearly 365 days a year, with hardly any backup or support? Considering that most health professionals are married to professionals, moving to rural Australia also means finding a position in a rural area so that the partner can also obtain work in their own profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just a matter of remuneration, because most health professional positions now vacant have excellent remuneration packages but still no takers are available. There has been a call for overseas doctors to fill the gap. Many rural areas are totally dependent on doctors who have come from overseas, who are doing excellent work. There are complex issues about overseas qualifications, and these can be worked out by examinations for competency. I do not believe this to be the longer term answer when we already have a surplus of doctors in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One doctor formerly from overseas, Dr Ganesha Thambipillay, known affectionately as Dr Pillay, has earned for himself a wonderful reputation at the Griffith Base Hospital as a dedicated paediatrician; however, he has recently announced that he will be leaving Griffith. When he came to Griffith in 1987 there were no paediatric services, nor a special care nursery. Along with the community, he has developed these services but has paid the price of turning into a workaholic, working 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Some time ago he said that he felt he needed a break because he feared he would burn out and be of little use to the community. He went on to say that there was no way one person could handle the workload and that there was no support available to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Pillay is moving to Wagga Wagga, a larger centre in which to practise, where he will have support from other paediatricians. He will be an asset to that community, but will leave Griffith and district in a very unfortunate situation, particularly those parents of children who have terminal illnesses. The interesting thing about Wagga Wagga is that this large centre&mdash;it is certainly a nice place to live&mdash;is itself short of at least seven general practitioners.

<PARA>In bringing this motion before the House, I am raising a matter of obvious concern to my constituents in Far North Queensland, and in particular the Torres Strait. These matters should be of concern to all Australians and all members of this House. Unfortunately, the activities of the Big Australian, BHP, have brought shame on the nation. There is clearly a need for a code of conduct for Australian based transnational corporations operating outside Australia, especially in the developing world. I welcome the government's initiatives in this regard and the fact that the Environment Protection Agency is convening a process, together with the ACF and the Minerals Council of Australia, to determine general environmental standards in this regard. I understand that my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) will discuss further that aspect of the motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorry saga of Ok Tedi has been in the media for some time. It is a battle that involves the landowners, their solicitors Slater and Gordon, BHP and the Papua New Guinean government. Unfortunately, there has been little media attention given to the potential effect of continuing the contamination of the waters of the Torres Strait as well as other waters off the Papua New Guinea coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ok Tedi-Fly River system, where it meets the Gulf of Papua, discharges at the rate of 6,000 cubic metres per second or nine times that of the Murray-Darling river system before it was dammed. To state that a non-polluted, non-contaminated Torres Strait is vital to the future health and wellbeing of the people of the Torres Strait is to state the obvious. A baseline study funded by the Australian government through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority was inconclusive about the level of contamination, but any Torres Strait Islander will supply you with anecdotal evidence about what they believe to be the contamination of vital seafood in the Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each day, the Ok Tedi mine processes 80,000 tonnes of ore from which copper is extracted. As the average copper content of the ore is only 0.7, 40,000 tonnes a day is discharged as tailings. The tailings contain low concentrations of heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and zinc. As only 85 per cent of the copper is extracted, there are also significant quantities of unextracted copper. The baseline study cautiously concluded that `the concentration of arsenic, cadmium, copper, selenium and zinc in the edible portion, particularly in liver and kidney tissues, of some foods consumed by Torres Strait Islanders repeatedly appear at larger doses to or above the National Health and Medical Research Council's maximum permitted concentration for seafoods'. These foods include Murray Island sardine, green turtle and dugong. Their conclusion&mdash;it is very conservative&mdash;is that the metals arsenic, cadmium and selenium are not believed to be associated with the Fly River discharge to any appreciable degree but that copper may be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is not in doubt is that the Ok Tedi mine has caused pollution to the Ok Tedi and Fly rivers. It has also caused damage to what is estimated to be 30 square kilometres of forests and gardens in Papua New Guinea. There also seems to be no doubt that some of the heavy metals have made their way into the vital food chain of the Torres Strait. That is why my motion before the House talks about the need for a further study and the constant monitoring of this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also no doubt that the Ok Tedi mine provides vital export earnings for Papua New Guinea. They are in need of foreign exchange and, of course, the mine provides employment but the question is at what cost to both the people of Papua New Guinea and my constituents in the Torres Strait, who gain no economic benefit from the mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Supreme Court has held that it does not have jurisdiction to order BHP to construct a viable tailings dam at the Ok Tedi mine site. There is no doubt that the building of a dam would be a difficult proposition. The mine owners from the beginning argued against building such a dam. On the insistence of the Papua New Guinean government construction of a tailings dam was commenced in 1983, only one year before mining was to commence. In 1984, before the mine was even started&mdash;and I am sure before construction was even started&mdash;a landslide smothered the site and collapsed the dam. It was then abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then general manager of what was then OTML&mdash;now the mine is owned by BHP&mdash;Mr Irwin Newman said, `The landslip setback was partly the company's fault because no intensive geological tests were carried out before the work got under way.' He also said, to his great shame I suggest, `There comes a point where you can't keep throwing money at a project.' So the tailings dam was abandoned and negotiated in its place was an agreement with the Papua New Guinean government to allow it to dump tailings directly into the Ok Tedi and Fly River system. That is the situation today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right from the beginning, the Ok Tedi mine was exempt from Papua New Guinea's environmental legislation. In February 1992 the international water tribunal stated that BHP `should thoroughly investigate the possibility of safe storage and treatment of wastes'. That has not happened. The controversial legislation before the Papua New Guinean parliament included a commitment from the Papua New Guinean government to undertake an independent study into the viability of a tailings dam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another provision in that original legislation which says that compensation to Papua New Guinean landowners can stop if the dam is built. Under that legislation, a tailings dam remains an option for BHP. BHP has undertaken an expensive media campaign in Australia. I would suggest that it is money misspent; it would be better spent in finding a solution to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the work of the Australian Conservation Foundation in this matter, in particular Dr Helen Rosenbaum and Mr Michael Krockenberger who presented a report in November 1993 which first brought this matter to the public's notice in the way of a comprehensive report. At the time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) passed a letter from the ACF to the then Prime Minister of PNG, there was some action promised but nothing happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With due respect to the honourable member for Melbourne, who will be seconding my motion, I ask: would there be a question of cost if the pollution was in the Yarra River instead of the Fly and Ok Tedi rivers, or would it be too hard or too costly to stop or at least mitigate pollution if the dam was outside of Melbourne or outside of Sydney? These are legitimate questions that my constituents can ask. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is no light matter. The continuing pollution of the Torres Strait threatens the health and wellbeing of my constituents. There are already enormous health problems in the Torres Strait. The level of diabetes in the Torres Strait is far higher than in any other part of Australia, apart from some Aboriginal communities. Therefore, seafood is vital to the wellbeing of the people of the Torres Strait. This motion is very important in that regard. We must continue to monitor the situation. BHP and the Papua New Guinean government, if they are good neighbours of Australia, must do something about the potential and continuing pollution of the Torres Strait and Far North Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) seemed to be backing the horse both ways: on the one hand, he said that there was some pollution in the Torres Strait area and, on the other hand, he conceded that the Ok Tedi mine was helpful to the New Guinean economy. It is easy for this parliament to have a go at multinational companies, even if they are Australian. It is easy to characterise the Ok Tedi issue as a case of a large Australian company exploiting the people of a developing country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that BHP and the Ok Tedi mining company have done more for the Western Province of Papua New Guinea than 1,000 Slater and Gordons, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> programs or Richard Carletons. I wonder what Slater and Gordon are going to get out of their whole argument. It is paternalistic and patronising for Australian public opinion, without knowing the full facts, to be telling the New Guinean government how best to regulate companies operating within their own borders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's imposing a code of conduct on BHP operations is no different from the cultural superiority of British colonialists who thought they knew what was best for the natives of underdeveloped countries. This motion raises the issue of whether Australian parliaments ought to be telling other governments how their local industries should be regulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">BHP has investments in India, Vietnam and South America where local governments have welcomed the benefits of their involvement, their expertise and their capital. These countries have investment opportunities which they cannot fully utilise. They need the investment, capital and expertise that BHP can provide. BHP must be a good corporate citizen since it operates both Australia-wide and internationally. It does not need Australian codes of conduct in order to ensure it behaves responsibly in developing countries. I note that Shell International Petroleum Company Pty Ltd is having some difficulties in Nigeria. All companies operating internationally in future will operate under a sensible code of conduct. I ask: would Australians prefer that there be no Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company accepts that there are environmental effects from the discharge of sediments into the Ok Tedi River, and the member for Leichhardt made that point. However, BHP claims that there are no toxic substances flowing into the river. The environmental effects of the discharges are temporary and things will quickly return to their pre-mine state shortly after the mine ceases production. A tailings dam is not feasible, and the member for Leichhardt concedes that point. The company has spent enormous amounts of money trying to get a tailings dam in position. The company and the PNG government have made every effort to ensure that the mine provides local people with some permanent benefits long after the mine runs out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I turn to the environmental issues which the member for Leichhardt is so worried about. It is important to bear in mind that there are environmental effects in the Ok Tedi and Fly river systems. These effects are reversible and no toxic substances are discharged into the rivers. That is the key element: they will return to their pre-mine state because of the climatic effect. The area of the mine is unique because of the steep slopes; extremely high rainfall, which is measured in feet rather than inches; and regular seismic earthquake activity. It is a very difficult part of the world in which to work, and I think the honourable member for Leichhardt concedes that point. There is real geological instability; there are occasional landslides; and, as I said, it is very difficult terrain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ok Tedi mine decided to build a tailings dam in 1993, on which $70 million was spent, and the dam foundations collapsed due to a landslide. The environmental impact of a collapsed tailings dam is far more drastic and hazardous than any ordinary discharge of mining residue into the river system. Since the collapse of the dam in 1984, no fewer than 120 independent studies have been undertaken to find a way to store waste material, but no acceptable means has been found to date. I challenge the member for Leichhardt to refute that position when the company has taken every responsible effort to solve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus the mine, with the permission of the PNG government, discharges sediment into the Ok Tedi River. But the government sets down limits on the amount of sediment which the mine can contribute to the river system. The limit, known as the acceptable particulate level, is 940 milligrams per litre. Typically, the mine's contribution is half the acceptable limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be remembered that the Fly River carries about 88 million tonnes of natural sediment each year, which is very high by any international standard. That is the key point to some of this argument: there is a lot of natural sediment that moves down the river with the high rainfall. That rather colours the argument that some commentators have made on this particular mine. So we have an unstable natural environment, which causes a large amount of geological activity, and high levels of sediment flowing down the river system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the fish numbers in the Ok Tedi River and the upper Fly River have decreased. However, this is reversible, and fish stocks are expected to return to their pre-mining levels very quickly after the mine ceases production. No toxic substances are discharged into the Ok Tedi or Fly rivers. Ok Tedi Mining reports to the government on a weekly basis. What better monitoring program would you want than that? The company's environmental department has 35 staff, three research vessels, helicopters and world-class sampling laboratories. Also, there is a system of external peer review by specialist consultants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at some of the facts of the Ok Tedi Mining operation. Currently, Ok Tedi Mining is owned 60 per cent by BHP, 20 per cent by Metal Mining Corporation and 20 per cent by the host government, the PNG government. It owns a part of this operation, so it is particularly interested in the outcome. The copper deposit, as members would be aware, was discovered in 1968 and a mining lease was granted to Ok Tedi Mining Pty Ltd in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A former member of the PNG government from Western Province made the point to me in a presentation that, prior to the commencement of the Ok Tedi mine, Western Province was the most disadvantaged part of Papua New Guinea. So those people from the local area were very keen to see this development take place because of the economic benefits that would flow to their area. They were very pleased to see BHP put up capital in a very risky environment, both in a monetary sense and in a climatic sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">BHP had to take all the risks, taking into account all those factors. It also faced the uncertainty of world copper prices, as our own Australian producers have done here in the copper mines. Ok Tedi provided the Western Province with a major industry and gave PNG another major mine after Bougainville, just after it had achieved independence. Copper production began in 1987, with BHP as the managing shareholder. The development of the mine has taken eight years and has cost $1.4 billion. That point has been overlooked by the member for Leichhardt opposite. BHP has invested a large sum of money in a fairly risky venture and has been prepared to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ok Tedi accounts for some 20 per cent of PNG's total export income. To put this into perspective, 20 per cent of Australia's export income is made up of gold, coal and wool exports. To close down the Ok Tedi mining operation in Papua New Guinea would be equivalent to removing coal, gold and wool from the Australian economy. What member in this parliament would contemplate that sort of action here because of the sorts of arguments that are being run?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ok Tedi employs nearly 2,000 people; 90 per cent of the work force are New Guinean, citizens. In 1990, Ok Tedi Mining created the Lower Ok Tedi-Fly River Development Trust to provide community assistance and business development to the 107 village communities along the Fly River. We have heard a lot of public comment on the disadvantaged communities. However, they have benefited considerably from the $19.3 million that has been contributed to this trust. Direct payments are made to the villagers, who determine their own community development needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus the trust has paid for the construction of community halls, classrooms, health care centres, roads and rain water storage tanks. Business initiatives have included commercial fishing and the rubber processing factory. Without Ok Tedi, that part of New Guinea would not have these developments and improvements in their standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is easy to criticise the multinational companies for their performance in developing countries but much more difficult to actually assist the local people to develop a self-sufficient future. We have a situation where the company is actually helping the people on the ground to develop their own industry in their own area and improve their standard of living. The people of Papua New Guinea need the capital and the mining expertise of a major company like BHP to make the Ok Tedi mine profitable. They need BHP's help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PNG government is very unhappy with paternalistic and patronising Australians telling them how to run their operations in very difficult conditions and how to regulate their companies. I think they are even more upset that legal suggestions are emanating from Australia as to how we might upset the PNG government's operation which creates real wealth and improves the standard of living of New Guinean naturalised citizens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in seconding the motion moved by the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), and I would like to thank the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) for reading out the latest press release from BHP for us in the parliament today. I would like to add a couple of points on the factual matters there that I do not think he canvassed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One is that approximately 58 million tonnes of waste is discharged into the Ok Tedi every year by the mine. Assuming that his figures are correct on natural sediment in the Fly River, about 40 million of that 58 million tonnes reaches the Fly River. So something in the vicinity of a 50 per cent increase in the level of sediment reaches the river system and 18 million tonnes approximately is estimated to stay within the Ok Tedi itself. The residence of the sediment is estimated to be roughly 15 years and, contrary to what the honourable member for Corangamite said, as outlined by my friend the honourable member for Leichhardt, there are toxic substances, namely heavy metals, in the discharges which would inevitably be there and, of course, are there in some significant amounts because of the sheer volume of the discharge from the mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that the mine has caused severe pollution problems: additional turbidity and particularly a loss of fish resources; and for those in many areas downstream a loss of the use of the amenity of water resource and the like. The significance of this can be seen by the fact that the impact is being seen by people as far-flung as the residents of the electorate of the honourable member for Leichhardt. That also indicates that, even though it is predominantly an issue for Papua New Guinea, it is also an issue for Australia. Australian citizens as well as Papua New Guinean citizens are being affected by the mine. The impact in Australia may be relatively limited compared with the impact in Papua New Guinea, nonetheless it still is an Australian issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true to say that BHP has expended a certain amount of money providing schools, health facilities and the like for some people in the area. But for BHP to proceed along this path is to get very close to an arrogant and almost colonialist assumption that that justifies any behaviour by a large company which, ultimately, is bigger than Papua New Guinea. BHP, as an entity, is bigger than Papua New Guinea and is able to exert that economic power in such a way that it&mdash;not the Papua New Guinean government&mdash;drives the terms on which the mine exists and operates. Yes, we have to acknowledge that BHP does do some good things, but we need to keep in mind that it does so from a very powerful negotiating position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the point of view put forward by the honourable member for Corangamite, we have to ask why then 71 land-holders representing roughly 30,000 villagers are taking legal proceedings against BHP in the Victorian Supreme Court and rejecting the settlement that the Papua New Guinean government offered of $110 million. Despite the fact that all sorts of tactics have been pursued by BHP to try to separate the villagers from their legal representatives, Slater and Gordon, they are still persisting in their position. We need to ask why they are taking this position. The answer is: because their interests have been irrevocably damaged by what is going on there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises very difficult issues. The honourable member for Corangamite is quite right: it would not be appropriate for us to adopt a neo-colonialist attitude of going in to tell the sovereign government of another country how it should conduct its affairs. Equally, the obverse of this position is just as reprehensible. We are told, for example, that a tailings dam is too expensive, impossible or whatever. In reality, this is code for: if we had a tailings dam, because of the individual circumstances, it would make the product of the mine uneconomic&mdash;we would not be able to sell it on the world market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because it competes with other copper producers and gold producers, this creates a situation where a Dutch auction occurs on environmental issues, human rights issues and the like right across the country. If you have a relatively weak government which is unable to enforce those sorts of issues, then the market drives down the price and the market drives down consideration given to such matters. So these are things to which we do have a responsibility to give consideration and more and more, as the world internationalises economically and Australians invest more and more overseas, we are going to confront those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is CRA in Bougainville, Shell in the Ogonis area of Nigeria, BHP and others in Chile, and the list goes on. Australians will be more and more involved and, if we just rely on the local law, that is a moral and economic cop-out. Are we prepared, for example, to see Australian investment in a racist society, in something similar to the old South Africa, or in economies that use child labour widely, or are we going to take some sort of moral stand?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud the initiatives of the government, and also the involvement of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, of which I am a member, in pursuing the issue of a code of conduct for Australian companies overseas. No, we should not be seeking to apply Australian law overseas, but there is a middle path, which means that there is some potential for us to influence how our companies behave and how they put forward Australia's good name overseas, and how they impact on the position of other people in countries such as Papua New Guinea.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that there are two core issues we are talking about in regard to this motion. One is the impact of activity in Papua New Guinea, and any obligations or whatever there are in terms of our and BHP's responsibilities there and the actions of Australia and Australians in that connection; and, secondly, the flow-on impact on Australia, that is, the Torres Strait islands, of what may be happening in PNG. I think it important that we understand there are those two fundamentally connected but different elements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion talks about a code of conduct, concern about pollution at Ok Tedi, pressuring BHP to prevent future pollution, the impact on the Torres Strait islands and that it is essential to ensure there is a continued clean environment. It also talks about monitoring the waters in the Torres Strait area on an ongoing basis. I would have to say that I agree with most of the matters raised in the motion. Whether you have been to Ok Tedi or not, you would only have had to have seen the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> or <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> programs, or seen the evidence that BHP themselves present at briefings, to understand there is pollution there and that those in the company themselves acknowledge it. The PNG government acknowledges it; there is really no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of what we see on television and in the newspapers is undoubtedly sensationalised and some of it is not very objective. But there is no doubt there is a fundamental pollution problem and we have to decide what we want to do about that. It seems to me that BHP has started to understand the problems and has started to react. We have seen that in some of the advertisements that it has run recently; we have seen it in some of the briefings of parliamentarians that have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the nub of it, of course, is the classic argument about economic benefit versus the environment, which seems to me to crop up in so many areas of activity today. As my colleague the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) said so correctly, this mine represents 20 per cent, one-fifth, of the PNG economy, and it has brought some benefits to a relatively small number of people. It is critical for that nation's future development. We cannot get away from the fact that obviously that will affect the decisions that are made in respect of BHP's activities at Ok Tedi. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly support part (2) of the motion which talks about the concern regarding the continuing pollution of the Fly River and monitoring in the Torres Strait. I support part (3) of the motion, that BHP must do everything possible to make sure they do the right thing and that they try in fact to prevent or minimise any damage, if humanly possible. I support part (4) of the motion, noting the potential impact on the Torres Strait. The information I have seen I do not think suggests that the impact on the seas in the Torres Strait is as severe as the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) was suggesting, but it seems to me that is addressed in part (5) of the motion that says yes, we should be doing ongoing monitoring. We need to see whether there is a problem and, if so, take stronger action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of outstanding questions. There is the question of PNG's sovereign power and the question of whether it is appropriate for Slater and Gordon to bring these matters to an Australian court. There is the question of whether in fact lawyers are taking advantage of the local people or whether politicians in PNG are taking advantage of the local people. Often it is a moot point, I would have to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are undoubtedly terrible technical problems at the site. It is not easy to mine in that area. An attempt was made to build a tailings dam and it went. I understand that those sorts of things happen quite frequently right across that part of PNG. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the first part of the motion, the code of conduct for Australian companies, I have no problem in principle with looking to Australian companies acting in a good corporate international citizenship way overseas, and a code of conduct helps.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation in Sri Lanka concerning the Tamil population is of great concern to all fair-minded people. In my electorate of Lowe I have a large number of Tamils, and I recently addressed a rally of over 300 Tamils at Burwood Park in Sydney. I pledged to these people that I would raise this issue in parliament. I call upon this government, if any request is made of the Australian government by the Sri Lankan government or any other international non-government organisation for either food, medicine, clothing or shelter, to stand ready to give whatever aid is required. I believe there must be a political, not a military, solution to this problem. Given the past and therefore the lack of trust, I understand the Tamils' desire to have the international community act as an honest broker in these negotiations. I believe the Tamils have the right to self-determination, whether it be their own country or their own administration of their territory or whatever workable solution can be properly achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tamil population in Australia also feel that reporting of the fighting is one-sided. They are, therefore, keen to see that their side of the story not be lost in media reporting. We are all aware that this present round of fighting was provoked by the Tamils breaking the cease-fire. They have their excuses for this, such as milk not getting through to the Tamil territory, but they are now paying a terrible price for this action. In war, truth is the first casualty but innocent victims the next. I call on the Australian government to help in whatever way it can to bring about a negotiated settlement for the Tamils and Sri Lanka. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3189" SPEAKER="Bilney The Hon G.N." NAMEID="RE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KINGSTON" MINISTERIAL="DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION & PACIFIC ISLAND AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia can be very proud of and pleased with the result obtained in Osaka with the agreement on the action agenda put forward by APEC foreign and trade ministers. Notably, the work done by Senators McMullan and Gareth Evans in that regard deserves commendation. It was agreed to by leaders and sets out a unique trade policy framework which gives real substance to the Bogor vision of free and open trade and investment in our region by 2010 for developed countries and by 2020 for developing economies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a unique framework because it does not rely on the traditional GATT style give and take negotiation. The final goals have been set. It is now up to individual members to prepare their own plans. The first stage of those plans will be reached by the end of next year when members submit their action plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process will not be purely unilateral, either. The action agenda includes agreement on a range of general principles that will guide APEC liberalisation, plus a process of consultation and review. It includes, very importantly, the principle of comprehensive coverage. That means for Australia that agriculture will be part of the process. That is an issue which is of key importance, including to those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion of flexibility is also written into the action agenda, but it will be exercised within the time frames of the Bogor declaration. We are very pleased with the wording on comparability, giving members confidence that their own liberalisation plans under APEC will be matched by the efforts of others. In other words, this is going to be a level playing field that we are achieving. The critical commitment in Bogor to the end dates of 2010 and 2020 for achieving free and open trade has been reaffirmed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While those trade liberalisation objectives have grabbed the headlines, there are other distinct and very important aspects of the action agenda, such as trade facilitation and economic cooperation, that will have a very considerable impact on the region's development. With its breadth and depth, the action agenda is a testament to the growing economic integration of the region and it will be seen as a major advance in its economic development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have done some modelling, which suggests that APEC trade liberalisation and facilitation will provide a very significant boost to economic growth in the region and, importantly, in Australia itself. In the Australian economy, real income is expected to increase by 6.8 per cent, or $A40 billion, as a result of free trade when all the effects flow through. Of that total, trade liberalisation will deliver a 4.3 per cent, or $A25 billion, increase in real income, while trade facilitation will deliver a further 2.5 per cent, or $A15 billion. That economic growth will mean employment growth of the order of 500,000 new jobs over the course of the liberalisation period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tangible benefits in the near term through trade facilitation will include simplification and harmonisation of customs procedures, the speeding up of trade flows and the building of private sector confidence through greater transparency across the region, facilitation through competition policy, rules of origin, dispute mediation, deregulation and mobility of business people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, for the region as a whole, Bogor's liberalisation and facilitation agenda is expected to increase income by around $993 billion, or 3.8 per cent, when all the combined effects flow through. That represents more than the current size of the Australian and South Korean economies combined, more than 10 times the size of the Malaysian economy and more than 1 1/2 times the current size of the Chinese economy. Those benefits will accrue to all APEC economies with developing APEC economies benefiting the most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that the Japanese government is to be congratulated on the results of Osaka. The work which Australia has put into that, including by the Prime Minister and Senators Gareth Evans and McMullan, was crucial to that. The Prime Minister will be making a full statement on Osaka when he returns.</PARA>

If so, will you now publicly acknowledge that the packages CRA has with the majority of its employees are authorised and supported by your policies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well before we made any changes to the industrial relations system&mdash;it has always been a part of the industrial relations system since time immemorial&mdash;employees had the capacity from time to time to enter into individual contracts. There is no question about that. It has always been there. It was there before we changed the industrial laws. It has been a constant feature of our industrial system since time immemorial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we regard as entirely inappropriate is a second set of workers doing the same type of work alongside people already performing those tasks&mdash;that they should receive, firstly, a set of conditions which means that there is a pay differential between them of something like $17,000 to $20,000. That is admitted. Secondly, we have always believed&mdash;we believe that the Industrial Relations Act upholds it&mdash;that there ought to be a capacity for workers, if they so choose, to collectively bargain and have that recognised and engaged by any of the companies concerned. That has not occurred until the intervention of the Prime Minister as far as these workers are concerned. It has not occurred in this instance until that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third thing that we have always supported very strongly is the capacity of workers to be represented by trade unions. The simple fact of the matter is that, whatever way you intend to dress it up, what is being applied here, within the constraints of the existing operation, is an effort by CRA to try to drive the unions out of its work force via establishing discriminatory arrangements between two sets of workers. Precisely that issue is being tested at the moment before the IRC because of the initiatives of the Minister for Industrial Relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You always let the cat out of the bag by whom you support. You are trying to say, `We have actually changed our position. We said that we could see the two working alongside each other and doing the same tasks and effectively being discriminated against.' You now try to deny and obfuscate that position, though you have made those statements repeatedly. It is like those statements where you say your position is that people in contract arrangements should not suffer a diminution of wages. You now say, `No. We have never said or implied that.' You have said it repeatedly and you say it in private all over the place, as the press gallery knows. Whether you say it now openly and publicly is another matter, but they are your intentions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You reveal your intentions by your attitude on this dispute, which is not to support the capacity of workers to collectively bargain or produce an equality of outcomes when the same work is being done by people essentially pursuing the same activity at the same level of responsibility. Your attitude is not to go in to bat on that. It is to go in to bat to defend whatever discriminatory practices are in place at the moment and to emphasise the capacity to get workers into individual contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You tip your hand every time and reveal that the occasional medicine of an industrial relations system that is relatively open, as our industrial relations system is, is your daily breakfast. That is the type of legislation that you would want to put in place, if it were ever capable of being implemented and if you ever managed to get yourselves into government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another ingredient in all this which is absolutely critical and a major differential between the point where this situation is now and where you would be. We believe in a strong Industrial Relations Commission with a capacity to intervene in the national interest and, if necessary, make either minimum rates awards or paid rates awards. That is our position. It is not yours. Your position is to gut the IRC. If you were confronted with this problem in office, you would be left without a capacity to bring in an independent arbitrator to act in the national interest to bring these matters to a conclusion as is being done at the moment. You would be left flummoxing, giving your opinions on this and that activity of the company and how sinful the unions were, and nothing else.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. I know that she has a very keen interest in this area of policy. As I have pointed out to the House on a number of occasions before, a great deal has been achieved by this government in assisting families, particularly with assistance targeted at low income families, including low income working families. I will remind the House of some key statistics. The real value of the additional family payment is up 76 per cent for children under 13. It is up by 147 per cent for children between the ages of 13 and 15. The breadth of coverage of the additional family payment for low income working households has increased enormously. There has been an elevenfold increase. Around 300,000 working families are now receiving the AFP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maximum level of rent assistance has increased by between 80 per cent and 140 per cent in real terms and been extended to low income working families. A further $5 increase per fortnight is due to come in in March. We have also seen the introduction of the additional parenting allowance, targeted again at low income families where one person is staying at home looking after the children. Again, substantial real increases are associated with that. So the picture is very clear that the real value of that assistance to families has been improved very considerably under this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second thrust, apart from increasing the value of this assistance, has been to try to ensure that the assistance gets into the hands of the primary carer&mdash;that is, the person who has the day-to-day responsibility of looking after the children. That has led to a number of structural changes in payments over the years. The most recent example is the replacement of the dependent spouse rebate with HACCA and then the parenting allowance for families with children. That has brought about a redistribution of income within the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A previous instance of where this government went down that route was in early 1993 with the so-called families integration where we split the payments so the family payments and the rent assistance components were explicitly directed to the primary carer. What was the effect of that split? That was not a measure that increased total outlays but it did bring about this redistribution within the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some very interesting research work and evaluation have just been completed by my department on the impact of that redistribution. It shows that as a result of that redistribution to the primary carer, not as a result of any increase, in 29 per cent of families there has been a significant increase in the amount actually spent on the children. So that is a very significant result which shows the wisdom and efficacy of our policy of getting assistance into the hands of the primary carer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This of course is another area of policy where we hear a lot of rhetoric from the opposition. We have heard nothing specific. We have heard references to income splitting, different variants of income splitting and so-called family taxation, all of which are highly regressive in their impact, all of which serve to increase work force disincentives for women and all of which are thoroughly regressive in social policy terms. This government's record in family assistance and the further measures we have announced in the budget demonstrate that our record is pretty solid and creditable, which contrasts with the policy vacuum on the opposition's side.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members would recall that a few weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition made a speech to ACOSS on social policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as there was any substance at all, the speech consisted of a series of negatives, a listing of things that he claimed that he would not do&mdash;a rather carefully formulated listing of things he would not do, by the way. For example, he would not slash $10 billion off the social wage. He left open the possibility that he would slash some figure less than $10 billion off the social wage, but he would not slash $10 billion off the social wage. So we have this continuing policy vacuum from the opposition. From their record we can make judgments on what they would do: pension allowances and payments to low income people all fell, or slipped behind indexation during his period of tenure as Treasurer and during the period of the previous government. So we do know some things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the other source of information about what the opposition may do and their actual underlying attitudes to social policy questions come from utterances from some members of their back benches and statements, in fact, from some of their frontbenchers in their more unguarded moments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that under this government we established a social safety net which, according to a recent study by a group of academics at the ANU, is one of the most efficient in the world in two respects: firstly, of a group of 10 OECD countries that were studied it is the most efficient in getting the assistance to those who need it and not making payments to those who do not need it&mdash;in other words, in targeting efficiency it was easily the most efficient social safety net of the group of 10 countries studied&mdash;and, secondly, in administrative efficiency it is the second most efficient in administrative expenditures as a proportion of program outlays. The only other country of the group that had a better ratio in that respect was Norway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in those two key respects we have a very efficient social safety net in this country. Notwithstanding the fact that we pay out less than many other countries on these payments, simply because of its greater efficiency we have a system which is comparably effective at preventing poverty. Yet we get this sort of nonsense from the member for Lilley's opponent somehow suggesting that people, pensioners and others who depend on these payments, are to be held responsible for our national debt. It is outrageous and scandalous and it really does reveal the true set of attitudes that underlie the thinking of the coalition on these issues.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the important things about the international globalisation of crime is that it does bring to account those who wish to hide the proceeds of crime and who wish to avoid tax. Organised crime and money laundering do go hand-in-hand. This government's response to the threat posed by money laundering included the creation in 1989 of Austrac, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre. That monitors some 20,000 transactions every day and has some 12 million transactions on its database. It has 80 staff and, under the direction of director Bill Coad, its job is to analyse financial transaction data and to identify criminal activity, including money laundering and white-collar crime and drug trafficking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key techniques that is used is the scheme by which banks and other institutions are required to report suspicious transactions to Austrac. One recent example is a person sending funds overseas through numerous bank branches in a suspicious fashion. Police checks revealed the use of false names and addresses. Subsequently a police operation resulted in charges and the seizure of a large quantity of heroin. There have been many other notable success stories. Included in those are 26 people being charged with more than 550 offences arising from a conspiracy to defraud the states and the Commonwealth by evading the payment of tobacco licensing fees. Over $30 million in tax assessments have been issued. A suspect transaction report provided key information concerning fraud in negotiable instruments and conviction of the offender and a long custodial sentence followed. A suspect transaction report from a financial institution identifying a false name account led to the arrest of a person operating as an unregistered tax agent forging signatures and falsifying claims. That person was jailed for several years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that Austrac has picked up on in recent times is the growing evidence that some solicitors are laundering money by placing cash in trust accounts to hide ownership of that money. For example, following identification of a series of unusual transactions, an investigation discovered that nearly three-quarters of a million dollars had been channelled through a solicitor's trust account. Charges have been laid in that matter. What we have done as a government has been to respond to that threat by requiring that solicitors ought report cash transactions of over $10,000, thereby bringing solicitors into line with other professionals. There will, of course, be no obligation to report merely suspicious transactions because of the reason of the solicitors' obligations to their clients in that regard. The actual operation of any cash transaction over $10,000 will now need to be reported following the legislative response that the government proposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not merely seen as successful in Australia; internationally the government has been successful in having a high profile. Australia has a leading role internationally in the fight against money laundering. The G-7 nations set up the Financial Action Task Force in 1989 to fight international money laundering. The task force was chaired by the current National Crime Authority head, Tom Sherman, in 1992-93. Australia funds the Task Force Asia Secretariat from our confiscated assets trust fund. Bill Coad, who is head of Austrac, recently was invited by the United States Office of National Drug Control Policy to speak on financial crime at a key international crime conference. That invitation, too, is an international recognition of our success, particularly Austrac's innovative use of technology to effectively analyse the huge volumes of material and financial information that it possesses. I understand that later today there will be a tabling of Austrac's annual report. I would commend its contents to members of the House, particularly to the honourable member who asked the question, and who has an ongoing interest in this area, for what I think is one of Australia's great successes in this area.</PARA>

The commissioner himself at an early stage at least appeared to recognise that that was problematic. Let me tell him it is. While the commission might be a royal commission in the sense that it was constituted as a so-called properly constituted inquiry, it shares some of the same characteristics with many others.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think the coalition's foreign affairs spokesman actually said that the coalition, if in the unfortunate event that it came to government, would cancel construction of the My Thuan bridge, but he did say that the project would be `reviewed'. But given that he has described this project as `inappropriate', `extravagant' and a `cynically timed exercise', I really would not fancy the chances of it seeing the light of the day if the member for Mayo ever had a say in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister and I announced on 15 November that the governments of Australia and of Vietnam had decided to proceed with construction of the My Thuan bridge, which is the largest infrastructure project ever financed under the Australian aid program, the shadow minister fired off one of his usual `get your mouth in gear but don't worry about the mind' responses. He was at his absolutely ill-informed and patronising best when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to build a second bridge across the Mekong is an inappropriate use of Australian aid money and a cynically timed exercise designed to lock up the aid budget long after Labor is gone.</PARA>
<PARA>Where has he been? Just how much attention has he been paying to the Australian aid program? Does he know, for example, that Australia's assistance in building this bridge was requested by the government of Vietnam as its highest infrastructure priority? Why is it such a high priority? The reason is the huge benefits that it is going to bring to the area. At the moment one has to cross the Mekong delta on a ferry. Fifteen million people live there. Around half of the country's rice is produced there. To take that to its market is a key project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a joint project. Vietnam is contributing around $28 million to the cost. Vietnam, of all countries, has no interest in building monuments, as the shadow minister called them, which are useless. On the question of the timing of the decision, does the shadow minister not know that this decision is the culmination of a well-established timetable which has been going on since 1993 with pre-feasibility and feasibility studies? Perhaps he does not know that because, when the general secretary of the Vietnamese communist party was in Australia meeting with people as disreputable as John Prescott&mdash;that rabblerouser&mdash;and the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition would not meet him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hardly surprising that the coalition would have no idea about Vietnamese priorities for the development of their country and absolutely no compunction about putting at risk Australia's relations with a country in which we are the sixth largest investor. Vietnam is a country where companies like BHP are carrying on important aspects of their business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mayo also implied that other aspects of our aid program could suffer as a result of our commitment to building this bridge. He is as ignorant on that aspect as he is on the aid program in general. The fact is that Australia will continue to have a balanced, effective mix of aid activities in Vietnam in which we will continue to devote real attention to health aspects, natural resource development, education and training. We will also continue to fund a non-governmental program which at last count currently involved some 29 separate projects. Even at the height of expenditure on the bridge program&mdash;which will be $18.5 million in 1999&mdash;the project will account for only about 20 per cent of the expected Australian aid flow to Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member asked about the implication for exports and jobs. As most members of this House know&mdash;perhaps with the exception of the shadow minister&mdash;our aid program is all about Australian aid. It is about Australian companies benefiting from infrastructure projects like the Mekong bridge. It is about Australian farmers who deliver the wheat and rice and who benefit when we deliver food aid overseas. The shadow minister's ill-considered statement on the Mekong bridge will certainly not be welcomed by the wide range of Australian companies that are active throughout Asia in the delivery of Australia's development aid. In fact, those companies have warmly welcomed the announcement we made the other day. Let me quote from the press release from the MTIA representing the manufacturing, engineering and construction industry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MTIA welcomes today's joint statement by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Development Cooperation. . . Tendering for the construction of the My Thuan bridge will be restricted to Australian companies, providing a high profile opportunity for Australia to demonstrate our world competitive expertise in construction, not just in Vietnam, but to other markets in the region. . . If Australia is to achieve sustained improvements in domestic living standards and job opportunities, it is vital that we increase the level of value added production, particularly of elaborately transformed manufactures and accelerate growth in value added exports.</PARA>

<PARA>The opposition simply does not realise that the aid program, as well as delivering essential development assistance to countries in our region, helps in a mighty way to create export markets for Australian goods and to create jobs for Australian companies and Australian workers. We are doing that in a way which makes most Australians feel very proud of what we are doing overseas. It is very sad that all one has seen from the opposition on aid is negatives. They have not come out with a policy. Before the last election they said that they would slash $200 million out of our aid budget. That is the last thing they said. That will not help our relations with Vietnam; it will not help our region's development; it will not help exports; and it will not help jobs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no end to the malice to come from the opposite side. What I was pointing out earlier was that the commission itself is flawed and was flawed right from the outset. If you want to talk about Family Court matters being raised, why did the terms of reference of the commission not include how that was first done, who did it and under what circumstances? The answers to those questions would seriously have embarrassed the present Premier. The terms of reference did not allow any examination either of whether or not Mr Court had made statements inside and outside the parliament that were inconsistent with what he said before the royal commission. That matter was not addressed at all by the royal commission.</PARA></TALK.START>

They ask what standpoint the Leader of the Opposition, who would not even be clear about what discussions, if any, he had had with Premier Court about this matter, can possibly have.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Calare for his question. I know that he, too, has been working hard to ensure there are more doctors practising in his rural electorate and others around the country. There is clearly an undersupply of specialists in rural areas and we have been addressing this problem. Despite the opposition's interest in other matters, we have been getting on with the job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As many members will know since they represent country electorates&mdash;particularly members on our side of the House&mdash;a lot of Australians have to travel long distances before they can get access to specialist services. That places a lot of stress on local GPs who have to manage some very difficult cases in the absence of specialist back-up. So we have implemented a number of initiatives to assist, including some $2.1 million which I announced today to boost specialist services. We have a major GP program but this will assist in the provision of specialist services; indeed, 14 new training specialist posts around Australia. The thinking behind it is that, if you train people in the country and they become accustomed to the lifestyle, they are more likely to return there and to practise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased to inform the member for Calare that $140,000 has been provided to the Central-West Health Service in Orange for an obstetrics and gynaecology training position, something that is much needed. Through this initiative of the 14 training posts, there will be positions in a number of specialties&mdash;ophthalmology, surgery, internal medicine and radiation oncology. They will be established in Townsville, Cairns, Kalgoorlie, Bunbury, Swan Hill, Wagga Wagga and Alice Springs. In addition, there are psychiatric training posts to be established in Broken Hill, Alice Springs and Mount Isa, because we know there has been poor access to psychiatric services. Part of the mental health strategy is to improve that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the means I have just announced, some 40 additional specialists will enter the work force over the next four years who will have had unique training in country areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly a pleasure this afternoon to be able to address the parliament on a very important issue that has been playing on the minds of a lot of my constituents for a number of years and is something that I have taken a personal interest in: the structure of the petroleum industry in Australia, the way that the industry is conducted and run, and the involvement of the government of Australia in parts of that industry with the regulation of prices for the wholesale price of petroleum and also with regulations for the setting of freight differentials. There are a number of other associated issues which are forming points of contention at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the House's attention to two reports that have been done in the last 18 months on the petroleum industry. The first, the Industry Commission report into petroleum products, was undertaken at the instigation of the government. This report was handed to the government on 5 July 1994. Interestingly, the government response came out on 21 September 1995&mdash;well and truly over 12 months afterwards. I think that is a bit of an indictment on the government's interest in this particular issue. At about the same time this year, a report was put together in fairly quick fashion in New South Wales, at the instigation of the New South Wales government, titled the Parry report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parry report was probably a bit more concise and understanding of the real issues that face consumers and small business people, particularly in regional Australia, with the costing and the structure of the industry. There are a number of very similar recommendations in both these reports which the government has basically chosen to ignore or not to act upon. It raises the question why. There are as many constituencies detrimentally affected by the way the industry is run at the moment represented by government members as there are represented by coalition members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is continually raised by members of the government yet they have chosen to do nothing. They have acknowledged the recommendations in these reports but have chosen to do nothing. I will read a couple of the more salient recommendations from the Industry Commission report, which was presented, as I say, to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) on 5 July 1994. The very first recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth should withdraw the Ministerial Directions and terminate the existing price surveillance arrangements in relation to petroleum products.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very important. That means: remove the Prices Surveillance Authority from the whole equation of establishing the rack price, or the wholesale price, and from the outmoded, outdated, antiquated process of setting the freight differentials around Australia. The other interesting recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government should encourage the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association, the Transport Workers Union and the oil majors to accelerate the withdrawal of the Laidley Agreement by negotiation. Failing progress in that direction, the Government should consider legislation to eliminate those provisions in the Agreement that have the effect of restricting competition.</PARA>
<PARA>The Laidley agreement is a very restrictive industrial agreement. Those two key issues were highlighted in the recommendations that the Industry Commission put in its report to the minister. Interestingly, those same issues arose in the Parry report, which was done for the New South Wales government, because at the time of the New South Wales election early in 1995 petrol prices were, and still are, a very hot issue around regional New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parry report is the result of one of the very few promises that the now Premier Bob Carr managed to keep. He said he would instigate a review of petrol prices in regional New South Wales, and he did. In the report Professor Parry again highlighted the same problems with the same recommendations that were highlighted in the Industry Commission report&mdash;they being in recommendation 2 of the Parry report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of any more substantial deregulation of PSA set charges, at least the PSA freight charge be removed subject to competitive access to terminals and depots by approved freight transporters, actual freight charges to be subject to market forces.</PARA>
<PARA>In one recommendation the Parry report has focused on some of the key problems in the petroleum industry at the moment, including the intervention of the PSA and ministerial directions. Interestingly enough, some of the briefings to which I have been a party have highlighted the artificial way in which the wholesale price of motor spirit in Australia is set. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One oil company representative was asked what relativity there was between the wholesale price of fuel as set by the Prices Surveillance Authority&mdash;it used to be about 69c a litre and, at the end of last week, it went up to over 70c a litre, which is an increase of over 1c a litre&mdash;and the price set by the oil companies. In answer to that question, the representative said, `The Prices Surveillance Authority sets the wholesale price of fuel. That's what we, the oil companies, charge.' Further to that, he said that the oil companies do not know what it costs them to produce a litre of motor spirit which is ready to go onto the market, which is a bit hard to believe. But the point is that the PSA sets a ceiling and everybody charges accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this day and age of the Hilmer reforms, both the Industry Commission report and the Parry report are recommending the elimination of that intervention, particularly by the Prices Surveillance Authority as far as the freight costs are concerned. It is so antiquated. In my electorate, there is a difference of almost 2c a litre in freight charges between two towns&mdash;Port Macquarie and Wauchope&mdash;which are probably about 22 kilometres apart. The cost of freight in the smaller centre, Wauchope, is 2c a litre cheaper than in Port Macquarie, which is on the coast. When questioned as to why there is a price differential, the Prices Surveillance Authority said, `Well, isn't Wauchope on the rail line?' Wauchope is on the north coast rail line. There is your answer: because Wauchope is on the rail line and it is closer, the freight costs are cheaper. But every single litre of motor spirit that comes into my electorate is transported by road; it has got nothing to with rail freight anymore. Yet the people in Port Macquarie are being penalised by almost 2c a litre because they are not on the rail line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole process needs to be reviewed. The transportation of fuel in Australia should be deregulated and proper market forces should prevail. To do that, we need legislative action to get rid of the Laidley agreement in order to give all operators access to fuel refineries so that they can have access to suitably qualified transport drivers and equipment to transport fuel. The government, in its response to the Industry Commission report, did not identify and would not address the issue of deregulation. Recommendation No. 3 of the Industry Commission report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government should encourage the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association, the Transport Workers Union and the oil majors to accelerate the withdrawal of the Laidley Agreement by negotiation. Failing progress in this direction, the Government should consider legislation to eliminate these provisions in the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>The government response which was put out by Minister Gear on 21 September this year&mdash;almost 18 months after he received the report&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The withdrawal of the Laidley Agreement is supported in principle. The Commonwealth believes withdrawal would be best achieved through the enterprise bargaining process.</PARA>
<PARA>But what happens to the enterprise bargaining process? We have seen what has happened in the last week as a result of the government's enterprise bargaining process. As soon as some of the mates do not like it, it all falls apart. It will not happen. There is no motivation for the government, as a result of that recommendation by the minister concerned, to see this happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot deregulate. We cannot say that we must have open competition in one sector and then have the government saying that we are not going to have open competition in another sector and protecting that other sector from competition by saying, `No, we're not going to let anybody compete with the ACTU or those people who are involved in those union organised industries.' The government needs to be fair dinkum in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, another point that raises its head in this whole debate about the cost of fuel&mdash;the difference in the cost of fuel is not apparent just between metropolitan and country areas&mdash;is the fact that, as of 1 August this year, the Commonwealth government collects 33.5c in excise from every litre of motor spirit sold. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The greyhound racing industry in Victoria is corrupt. It is rotten through and through. The time has long passed for the Victorian government to appoint a royal commission to inquire into all aspects of the greyhound racing industry and the dog breeding industry associated with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My interest in greyhound racing started when a number of my constituents approached me late last year concerned about a major dog breeding fraud. This fraud involved a dog known as Malawi Prince, owned by Mr Tony Lockett. The fraud was fairly simple: the owner of a bitch took her along to be mated with Malawi Prince for a fee of up to $1,500, but instead of being mated with Malawi Prince it turned out that the bitch was mated with a lesser sire, so an inferior dog was produced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a secret. It is known that this has occurred. DNA testing has now been conducted on a number of dogs allegedly bred from Malawi Prince, and it has been identified that the dogs could not have been bred with Malawi Prince as the sire. The only issue so far as this fraud in Victoria is concerned is just how many dogs are involved. My constituents estimate that up to 40 individual dogs involved in the breeding industry in Victoria could have been falsely alleged to have been bred with Malawi Prince as the sire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very important, because the fraud upsets the whole breeding line of dogs in Victoria. But, worse than that, it is a fraud, a scam. A lot of money has been paid by reasonably earning people, and they have been ripped off. The problem they face is that it costs hundreds of dollars to have a DNA test done. Most of the people whom I represent are only wage earners, and some of them do dog racing and dog breeding as a hobby. They have enough trouble raising and breeding their dogs without being hit with a massive fee for DNA testing to see whether their dogs have been appropriately bred or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the information on that fraud, I got in touch with the relevant minister, Mr Tom Reynolds, in Victoria. I raised those allegations with him. He wrote back and told me that the police were investigating this dog breeding scam and that I would hear more about it. Shortly after that I received, anonymously, a document. This document will be called a scandal sheet. It has the most outrageous allegations contained in it. When I read it I thought that I could not possibly use any of this material, that it does not seem to be particularly fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document alleges, among other things, that for a fee of up to $500 you can bribe the official in charge of selecting the racing boxes at dog meetings. It alleges that it is quite easy&mdash;you just pay $500 and choose the box from which you want to start your dog. It says that the practice is very common. It also alleges that the lure operator can be bribed to manipulate the speed of the lure, so manipulating the outcome of a particular race. It makes allegations of massive drug use, particularly with beta-blockers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document makes allegations of corruption among members of the Greyhound Racing Control Board and other officials of the greyhound industry in Victoria. For example, it says that a bookmaker removed a swab sample from a head steward's car and that that swab sample was taken from a dog owned by the very same bookmaker. It goes on and on making the most serious allegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only does it make those allegations but it also names the people involved. It is not my practice in this House to name people unless I have evidence that substantiates the allegations put to me. Most members understand where I stand on this issue. In the document, there was an allegation concerning Tom Reynolds, the Victorian minister who is in charge of dog racing in Victoria. I will quote from the document. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Reynolds&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">raced greyhounds provided for him by the GRCB and Kevin Richards, who ensured an ongoing relationship, thus keeping Reynolds "in check". While stating publicly of not being a big punter (50 cents) was often seen at Warragul with a fistful of 100 dollar notes punting his dogs. Little did he realise that the only people to benefit from his gambling were Kevin Richards, working hand in hand with the bookmaker!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reynolds continues to support the GRCB and its present members, even though they all consider him to be a dead set dill.</PARA>
<PARA>When I read that originally, I said, `That's pretty scandalous. There is obviously nothing in that. That's not true.' That was the case until I picked up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of 17 November 1995. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sports Minister Tom Reynolds was given a lucrative lease of a greyhound, which won $15,715, through a government body he now regulates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Reynolds yesterday admitted the arrangement, in which he shared a lease with former Liberal Party state president Michael Kroger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the deal with the dog's owners, the Greyhound Racing Control Board, he and Mr Kroger repaid 1 per cent of their winnings to the board.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the cost of him getting a lease of the dog from the board. The document alleges that this has been going on for a long time&mdash;ever since Mr Reynolds has been a member of parliament, and when he was shadow minister. As I said, I did not believe it. I thought it was scandalous. Yet here it is confirmed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of 17 November that the Victorian minister responsible for the control of the dog racing industry in Victoria has been party to an arrangement where he got, for one per cent of the winning cost, a lease of a dog. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trainers of the dog, Liberal Victory&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a good name: Liberal Victory&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">estimated their costs to be about half of the winnings, leaving about $8000 profit for Mr Reynolds and Mr Kroger.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not a bad deal, is it? For no outlay at all, you pick up a cool eight grand, plus, if you know what is going on at the track, the gambling profits through the bookies&mdash;and, if this document is to be believed, they are all crooked as well. Who knows how much Mr Reynolds could have made out of what is, at the best, a deal he should never have entered into?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That concerned me. That report confirms much of what is involved in the document which I have said is a scandal sheet. It makes allegations about corrupt officials, corrupt breeding, corruption in politics and corruption amongst officials and bookmakers&mdash;corruption through this whole industry, which, it appears to me now, is absolutely rotten. It is confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the response of the Victorian Liberal government to this? We know what Mr Kennett usually says when he finds out that ministers tell lies&mdash;like Mr Baxter in parliament. He said on 3AW, `So what?' That is his response when his ministers are found doing things which in this parliament the opposition would draw attention to. Mr Kennett simply says, `So what?' Mr Reynolds simply said that he raised it after he had been minister for a few weeks, but there was nothing wrong with that. He said that the money won on the animal refinanced three other dogs he leased. Not a bad deal if you can get it!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 18 November, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> published a report saying that the police were conducting four probes into the greyhound industry in Victoria, alleging around $2 million worth of racing rorts, including drugging of dogs. Suddenly this scandal sheet is not so scandalous. Suddenly the names and the allegations that are contained in this scandal sheet are not so scandalous; they may be true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria the minister who is in charge of investigating the whole deal is part of a deal where he gets an unfair profit out of the system. You cannot expect on that basis to get a fair and proper investigation. In Victoria we have allegations, a minister who is deep in the middle of the allegations and a state Premier who does not care what his ministers do. Where do we go? The only answer, and the fairest answer, is for Mr Kennett to urgently introduce a royal commission with a very broad reference to inquire into all aspects of the dog racing industry in Victoria. Otherwise, obviously, dog racing in Victoria will be suspect; it will continue to be described as rotten and corrupt and the small owners of dogs&mdash;the little people out there who we hear the opposition talk about&mdash;will continue to be ripped off with dog breeding scams and drugging of their dogs in racing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an outrageous set of affairs. I call on Mr Kennett and the Victorian Liberal Party to do something about it. Mr Reynolds should have the decency to retire from his ministerial position and Mr Kennett has no option but to call a royal commission. </PARA>

In past years, drugs&mdash;notably amphetamines&mdash;have been very much part of this scene. Therefore, the suggestion that millions of dollars worth of drugs have been manufactured&mdash;courtesy of a failed police operation&mdash;in time for sale this week on the Gold Coast is one that must fill many parents with dread. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Brisbane chemical manufacturer who supplied the chemicals for these drugs is now in hiding in fear of his life. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> story states that he owes $30,000 to a drug syndicate, a down payment for chemicals police had him make but would not then let him sell to it. It also claims that he is being held responsible by members of a drug syndicate for a recent police raid on the gang's premises. Further, New South Wales police have threatened to charge him for supplying chemicals, even though he had been given indemnity in the operation by Queensland police and a Queensland detective had indicated to him that there would be no charges from New South Wales if he kept quiet about this failed police operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This story should fill every member of the Australian parliament with apprehension. Recently the House of Representatives passed some legislation which has the effect of enabling members of the Australian Federal Police to become involved in illegal activities if they are part of a covert operation. Many people have misgivings about `legitimising' this type of police activity. Yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> story would reinforce such apprehensions. It is one of many stories where police have become involved in this type of activity, to no good end result&mdash;namely, the arrest of people who run Australia's illegal drug trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest anyone seek consolation in the suggestion that, because it is the Queensland Police Service who have bungled this operation, the actions of other police forces should not be similarly critically scrutinised, the fact is that there is plenty of evidence that our various police forces are prone to either making the same types of errors or treating our citizens in a callously negligent manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I was approached by a constituent who had voluntarily worked with the New South Wales police force in a similar type of operation. I wish to make it very clear that this constituent of mine has not himself engaged in any illegal activity before, during or since the incident I am referring to. He was a legitimate businessman who had never had any problems with the police in his life but who came by some information which, as a responsible citizen, he made available to the police. Thanks to his undercover work, undertaken under the supervision and direction of the New South Wales police, arrests were made in that case and trials are pending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parliament's sub judice convention precludes me from giving further details of the case lest the people involved be identified and the case prejudiced. However, I can say that as a consequence of those arrests my constituent lives in fear of his life, under severe financial duress, because he has had to abandon his business, his livelihood, as a direct consequence of the serious nature of the matter in which he assisted the police. All this has happened because he does not have recourse to the benefits of codified witness protection legislation or guidelines. They are non-existent in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the House of Representatives enacted witness protection provisions. The act was also meant to be a model for state governments to follow, but very few have done anything about it. Indeed, one of my reasons for raising this issue is to urge the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) to take immediate action to persuade those states which do not have witness protection legislation to act on it quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As things stand, without witness protection legislation state police forces can&mdash;and do, to my knowledge&mdash;treat ordinary citizens in an utterly unconscionable manner. There are now just too many stories of law-abiding citizens who have endangered their own lives in order to assist law enforcement agencies, only to find themselves destitute because they cannot pursue their previous livelihood from hiding&mdash;whether because cases are waiting to be heard in the courts or because police have bungled the operation&mdash;and because they have no entitlement to stop-gap financial support for them and their families. For example, my constituent has even had his car repossessed because he could not maintain the payments, and the New South Wales police&mdash;having used him to the hilt for their own purposes&mdash;are now just turning their backs on him and refusing to ensure that even the basics are provided for him and his family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from the financial penalty that citizens can suffer as a consequence of doing what they see as a duty to help the forces of law and order, there is an enormous psychological burden that has to be borne by them also. Undercover operations are extremely stressful. Members of the police force receive counselling and assistance for the stress and psychological effects they may suffer as a result of undercover operations. However, no such support is given to civilians, who are left to cope as best they can. It is beyond me to fathom the callousness of this attitude, particularly coming from those who experience the same stress themselves&mdash;albeit with the more comforting fall-back position of being able to take superannuated early retirement on the basis of the stresses of the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these matters&mdash;the provision of financial and/or emotional support&mdash;to be at the whim of individual police officers is no way for a civilised society to behave. Maintenance of law and order is, without a doubt, the public issue that Australians feel to be the most important for governments to provide, and they are right to feel that way. The first responsibility of any national government is to maintain the security of the nation, that is, adequate defence. The second responsibility of a national government, and the first responsibility of all state governments, is to maintain the internal security of our society: the protection of the right of citizens to feel that they can live their lives without threat of physical harm for so long as they themselves are law abiding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter does not, however, only rest with various agencies of law and order and any witness protection mechanism that may be put in place. There are other agencies of government which have a role to play. For example, in the case of the constituent I have referred to, a detailed complaint has been made to the New South Wales Ombudsman, which was a very proper course for my constituent to take. However, whilst the office of the ombudsman has indicated that it will deal with this case as expeditiously as possible, there are certain bureaucratic constraints on the ombudsman&mdash;which does not help anybody to pay the rent if they find themselves in a similarly unfortunate position. Ombudsmen need the ability to move swiftly where the damage a citizen is suffering is such that there are issues of immediacy, such as how to pay the rent, buy groceries and have reasonable access to proper medical and legal support. Present mechanisms simply do not permit this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When law-abiding citizens make an honest attempt to assist our agencies of law and order to carry out their responsibilities, they should at least know that they will receive not only reasonable protection from capricious behaviour by those very law and order agencies, but also adequate support in the event that their efforts to assist mean they can no longer support themselves. As I understand it, past efforts in New South Wales to codify witness protection have met with obstruction from the New South Wales Police Force itself. There are a number of probable reasons for this&mdash;some of them may be plausible; others could be sinister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last year, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority detained 153 ships with serious safety deficiencies. This year up to October, AMSA has detained 203 ships. Some people might argue that this means that more defective ships are visiting Australian ports.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However welcome these substandard ship detentions are, there is a much more insidious practice on the Australian coastline, which no-one seems to care about or, apparently, Australian law is deficient to overcome.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Make no mistake, if these activities were committed onshore, people regardless of where they came from would be charged and, in many cases rightfully, thrown into gaol. Not only are these crimes being committed, but they are going without punishment, and they are permitted to continue going unpunished. I think there is an element of racism here because many of the seafarers concerned are from Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on about the many incidents I have heard about seafarers mysteriously disappearing or going overboard, and of seafarers being bashed and brutalised, through my close association with the Mission to the Seaman. Rarely are such incidents ever brought to the attention of the media in Australia. We are talking about bashings, disappearances and, indeed, murder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw the attention of the House to an incident involving a Japanese owned but Panamanian registered vessel, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Glory Cape</EMPHASIS>, two weeks ago off the coast of Western Australia when the ship was at anchor off Dampier and the Indonesian crew were involved in a dispute with the Korean officials of the vessel over pay and working conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A brawl erupted on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Glory Cape</EMPHASIS> after two of the Indonesian crew, who were arguing for better working conditions, went to the captain on this. On the instructions of the Korean captain, Korean crew members took iron bars and bashed the Indonesian crew and bashed one crew member, the radio operator, to such an extent that he has now died. That is murder and that will go unpunished because this ship has now left Australian waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Glory Cape</EMPHASIS> was alongside her berth in Karratha, the seven Indonesian crew approached the International Transport Federation's West Australian inspector, Norm Pickles, to negotiate with the vessel's operator, First Line Corp. of Seoul, through their agents in Australia, Burns Philp, to get them an ITF acceptable agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Negotiations were set to begin after the vessel had been loaded and berthed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Pickles asked the radio officer to put the master on the phone, but the master was very agitated and he tried to assure Mr Pickles that the engines were only going on in the expectation of unfavourable weather. The master assured Mr Pickles that he had no intention of setting sail. However, allegedly due to pressure from the vessel's owners, the master decided to sail. It was at this point that the Indonesian crew confronted the master and the thuggery began. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five of the crew jumped seven metres into the waters off Dampier and one, the radio operator, a 28-year-old Indonesian seafarer, died as a result of this thuggery or, as I would say, was murdered, which is all too common in territorial waters around the world and which is becoming too common around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For four hours the crew huddled together in treacherous, shark infested waters, before they were spotted by a Woodside Petroleum helicopter at 6.45 a.m.&mdash;and the master of the vessel did not even inform the authorities that people had gone overboard, which by international law you are supposed to do. The dead man was flown ashore by helicopter and the others, suffering hypothermia, were taken by boat to the hospital. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Glory Cape</EMPHASIS> then was detained by AMSA while several breaches in safety standards were rectified. But one Indonesian crewman at this time had the gall to complain about conditions on the vessel and appeal to the authorities to intervene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the West Australian representatives of the International Transport Federation, work records and overtime records indicated that the crew were being paid well below ILO levels and were working excessive overtime. Of the seven crew involved, four were earning $380 a month, two were paid $750 a month and the radio operator earned around $1,000 a month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ILO minimum monthly wage is set at $US780, while the International Transport Federation minimum is $1,100 per month. So, if you are a foreign seafarer working in conditions and being paid well below what is reasonable as identified by the standards of the ILO, which is the circumstance in this case, and you complain or ask for the assistance of the authorities, you are bashed and brutalised, you are forced to jump ship because you fear for your life, or you are killed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a country, Australia has led the charge to clean up ship standards. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure produced a report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>, which was rightly lauded throughout the world. But, although we have cleaned up the ships, what have we done about the conditions of the crews? As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, AMSA has increased substandard ship detentions, and that is why this vessel, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Glory Cape</EMPHASIS>, was detained. But, while we have led the charge to clean up the physical side of vessels, much more needs to be done to ensure that the pay and working conditions of crews on vessels are improved. It seems that Australian law is impotent when crews are abused and threatened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of this could be changed if Australia were to ratify ILO convention 147. AMSA should be concerned with the condition of crews; it is as much a safety issue as defective conditions on board vessels. I understand that negotiations and consultations with the states are progressing well and, hopefully, ILO convention 147 will be ratified next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every day foreign nationals are being bashed and abused on ships in Australian waters, and Australian authorities feel they are powerless to do anything about it. Of course, the foreign crews are often very reluctant to lay charges because they know that they or their families in their home countries will be victimised. It is time that these things were brought out in the open. Indeed, I understand the Indonesian government, through its consul in Western Australia, has raised these issues with the Australian authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important that the situation regarding Japanese fishing ships in Australian waters be examined and the arrangements that they have, especially the sham training schemes that are in existence. I would ask the minister to have a look at some of these sham training schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are too many ships like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Glory Cape</EMPHASIS> around the Australian coastline. This is the sort of thing that we can expect if the ANL sale proceeds and the Australian coastline is even further opened up to foreign-flagged and foreign-crewed vessels. As Australians, we would not tolerate bashings, especially bashings leading to death on land, so why should we tolerate it at sea, especially in Australian territorial waters? It is a tragedy and a disgrace that cannot be tolerated any longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from being detained for some time while some defects were rectified on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Glory Cape</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Glory Cape</EMPHASIS> has left Australian waters. No charges will be brought against the captain or the Korean thugs who, acting on the captain's orders, bashed the Indonesian seafarers and, as I say, bashed them to such an extent that they feared for their lives and jumped overboard&mdash;the radio operator died. I believe that captain and the Korean crew acting on the captain's instructions were guilty of murder in Australian waters and that they should be charged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not an isolated incident; it is happening every day. If foreign crews complain in ports in Australia, or if they contact the International Transport Federation, more than likely they will disappear.

This is one of the reasons I have always been opposed to giving up cabotage, and I have always been opposed to the further opening up of our territorial waters or our coastline to foreign crews. As I said, many of these people are reluctant to complain because, if they do, their families are victimised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One could in fact say that this is something of an idyllic time to be in rural Australia as there are plenty of farmers going around listening to the grain running into the backs of their headers and smiling at the prospect of delivering into what are more and more promising grain markets&mdash;and barley markets, as the minister at the table interjected. You could say that rural Australia is the place to be. After all, at a superficial glance you would see nothing but plenty of fresh air, open space, what would be regarded as a generally less stressful lifestyle than in urban Australia, and all in all the right sort of environment in which to raise a family. It ought to be the healthiest section of the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But a report, discussion paper No. 9, to the Australian National University done by the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health has indicated an astonishing figure that women in rural Australia are 90 per cent more likely to die from pneumonia or influenza&mdash;astonishing, given what one would expect to be the fresh air that characterises rural Australia&mdash;and 50 per cent more likely to die from diabetes or a car accident than are their counterparts in urban Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was prompted to raise these matters in this grievance debate by remarks made earlier today in a private member's motion by the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), supported by the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), reflecting on the absence of rural doctors and the need for the government to adopt a strategy to encourage doctors into rural practice. I noted that the motion had cross-party involvement in that the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) was also involved. Ironically, it coincided with a question asked today by the member for Calare (Mr Simmons) to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in answer to which she announced a government initiative to encourage the appointment of more specialist medical officers into rural areas, that $2.1 million would be available for additional specialist services and that $140,000 was to be earmarked for one specific rural area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not speak here simply to blacken the government's name by suggesting that there is a desperate need for additional medical practitioners in rural Australia, though there certainly is, but I was prompted to participate in this debate by one of the comments made by the member for Hunter, who, I thought, mischievously implied that until 1992 nothing had been done. If what the member for Hunter said was right, the government stands condemned for having been idle for a decade on this issue of what ought to happen in rural Australia. But let us ignore that for just a moment and focus on a real disadvantage that currently exists for rural people simply because of their inability to access the medical services that urban people have come to take for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I freely acknowledge the member for Hunter's point that in 1992 something happened: in the 1992 budget a rural health curriculum was announced to enable a particular focus on the training of doctors for rural practice and as part of a general practice reform package there was a proposal to earmark $2.5 million specifically to recruit GPs into rural practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this came after a decade of inaction, and the fruits of these 1992 initiatives are still scarcely being seen. In fact, so desperate was the state of rural medical practices in my state of South Australia that the South Australian government stepped in just recently and announced a $50,000 rural health scholarship scheme which it intends to use specifically to encourage young men and women to take up medicine as a career. In order to assist them with the costs of being trained in an appropriate medical career as either a GP or a specialist, $5,000 will be made available to each of those young people over a three-year period&mdash;$15,000 in total&mdash;on the understanding that for every year that they are beneficiaries of that government input they will mirror a year in rural service. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality remains that in rural Australia there is a desperate need for enhanced general practice and specialist services. Even the announcement made by the minister in question time today will not do enough to meet that need. In the face of drought and depressed prices a statement was made by the Rural Drug and Alcohol Issues Conference in Dubbo. The conference statement indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drug misuse, particularly alcohol, is having a devastating social and economic impact on rural Australia. In many rural communities, the level of alcohol misuse is well above the national average, and drug related harm, including accidents, violence and crime, are major sources of community concern.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy to stand here and be critical. What I want to express to the minister and to the government is that a more rapid solution than we have seen is also in their hands and has been advocated by one of their own but not picked up and run in the debate here on the private member's motion or in response to the question asked today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) has advocated that the House ought to be looking at encouraging additional rural GPs by offering them additional computer facilities so that they can have on hand the sorts of specialist advice they must currently long for when they have a complicated case which they are forced as a lonely rural GP to deal with on their own. I would encourage the government to pick up the initiatives advocated by the member for Moreton and to this date largely ignored.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly not only was there intimidation in regard to the signing of the contracts but also workers who were union activists were isolated and crane drivers were put in stores simply for the purpose of undermining collective bargaining and trade unionism. Clearly, workers were offered over-award payments. It is understandable that workers with heavy family commitments, especially workers with large families, were under enormous pressure by the company to sign up. The striking workers tell me that there was a great deal of coercion put on workers at Weipa to sign up. The fact that a lot of those workers who have signed individual contracts remain trade union members might indicate even to those people opposite that those workers still have a commitment to the trade union movement but may have just been coerced into signing a contract perhaps for financial gain but perhaps because they feared for their jobs. </PARA>

If you are a family man and you are faced with that situation then you start to think: where else will I get a job?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pressure has been put on workers. Some of those workers have signed the contract. There have been calls for the government to introduce legislative change, but it is difficult to see what legislative change could be introduced. We do not want to have a situation where over-award payments are somehow outlawed. What we want is a situation where the principle of equal pay for equal work is recognised and the international principle, the right for workers to collectively bargain, is also recognised. Both of those things have been denied by CRA. It is outrageous that CRA has stated that workers on awards are of less value than workers who have signed contracts.</PARA>

Ten years ago if you went to Weipa and criticised Comalco, all the workers would have quickly come to the defence of Comalco. Today, they simply want to exercise their right to collectively bargain; they want adequate reward for the long years of service that they have given to the company; and they want equal pay for equal work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate to rise in the grievance debate this evening to speak on behalf of the students, the staff and the parents of Covenant College. Covenant College is an independent Christian college located in the suburb of Gordon in my electorate. It is a growing school; it serves a distinct need; and until last week it had recurrent funding for its growing secondary school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, just three weeks before the end of term, the school was advised that because the government had judged the school to be too small no recurrent funding would be forthcoming for next year. That has put great pressure on all the students, the staff and the teachers, but particularly on the students in the lead-up to the end-of-year exams. This funding was denied while the government has in its possession an interim report on the review of its own new schools policy. It is interesting because the rules have changed midstream and this school, Covenant College, is being judged. The report itself says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Decisions should not disadvantage particular applicants in mid-process.</PARA>
<PARA>It further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . all schools should be put on the same financial basis as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>Covenant College was denied recurrent funding because it was too small, yet the report simply says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present requirement for 25 students in each junior secondary year is too onerous.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schools seeking to extend to secondary level and start-up secondary schools with planned extension by adding a new class each year should have four years to reach the total enrolment targets.</PARA>
<PARA>It is curious that, while the government has a report that outlines deficiencies in its own new schools policy, it continues to judge some&mdash;I say only some&mdash;schools on these old criteria while I am told that other schools are allowed to continue. It is interesting because the review has recommended changes to ease the burden on growing schools but, even before the government responds to the review, it withdraws funding from a junior secondary school that fits many of the problems highlighted in the McKinnon report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The college was being judged on the criteria which the government knows it needs to change. I believe that the college would fare far more favourably under the revised criteria recommended in the McKinnon report. To add insult to injury, the school has been lobbying the minister for quite some time now to find out its status. It received this letter saying that funding had been denied on 9 November this year, which is very curious because written notification for recurrent funding closed on 31 October this year. So the poor old school does not have the advantage to even appeal this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I attended a meeting at the school the other night. I admire their determination to continue their school and to continue to provide quality Christian independent education in the Tuggeranong Valley and I thank them for doing that in my electorate. But they cannot even get a meeting with the minister to discuss their future. He has denied them even that option. I find it an absolutely amazing thing that a minister would not even wish to talk to a school about their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) is the shadow minister at the table. I thank him because he will speak with this school, advise it and assist it in any way that he can, as will I, in dealing with a government that, whilst it knows it has a flawed new schools policy and whilst it knows it has the McKinnon report which it has to answer, takes on&mdash;it will not even leave it for a little bit longer&mdash;a decent school, a good school. We have to ensure that that school may continue to provide education for the students of my electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In November 1994 members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities visited the Sydney Futures Exchange to observe its operations and meet informally with the executives of the exchange. The committee subsequently decided to conduct a public hearing at the Sydney Futures Exchange to discuss its operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shortly before that scheduled hearing, Barings Bank crashed as a result of massive losses by its Singapore branch in derivatives trading. This incident gave additional and sharper focus to the committee's hearing. The committee subsequently decided that it should hold public hearings on the regulation of derivatives with the Australian Stock Exchange, the Australian Securities Commission and the Corporations and Securities Advisory Committee to discuss both the Barings crash and general issues relating to the regulation of derivatives in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Derivatives serve an important function in allowing businesses to manage their exposure risk by hedging. This means that businesses can buffer themselves against adverse movements in the markets and can plan future activity with greater certainty. However, speculative trading in derivatives carries with it the potential for both very large profits and losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence to the committee at public hearings the Sydney Futures Exchange and the Australian Stock Exchange outlined in some detail the procedures and safeguards in place to detect excessive and potentially dangerous trading patterns in the markets they operate. They also outlined the powers they have to take action when they detect such problems. The committee asked each of the witnesses who appeared before it whether they could guarantee that a collapse like Barings could not occur in Australia. The ASX and the SFE told the committee that they could not guarantee that a major crash like the Barings crash could not occur in Australia. However, they said that the procedures in place minimise the possibility of that happening. They also assured the committee that should a similar event occur here the procedures in place would minimise its impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also asked the witnesses about the adequacy of the Corporations Law and the review currently being conducted by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. In May 1994 the Australian Securities Commission published its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Over-the-counter derivatives markets</EMPHASIS>. That report examined the nature and size of derivatives markets, and the participants and risks involved. The report recommended that there should be a review of the complex regulatory and law reform issues arising from increased activity in over-the-counter derivatives transactions. It also proposed changes to the regulatory framework for derivatives markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the release of the ASC report on over-the-counter derivatives the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee commenced its review of derivatives regulation. The Corporations and Securities Advisory Committee has subsequently published an international comparison of derivatives regulations and a discussion paper on the regulation of the OTC derivatives market. The discussion paper proposes a range of regulatory initiatives designed to enhance existing controls over the Australian OTC market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advisory committee is currently seeking submissions on its proposals and the issues raised in the discussion paper. The advisory committee intends to publish a further discussion paper on the regulation of exchange traded derivatives and the regulation of a possible secondary or tradeable OTC market. The committee will continue to monitor this review of the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some recent developments since the committee conducted its hearings. Both the Bank of England and Singapore reports on their investigations into Barings have become available. Although the committee has not had the opportunity to examine these reports in full, they bear out the main points made to the committee during its hearings. The Bank of England report, for example, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Barings' collapse was due to the unauthorised and ultimately catastrophic activities of, it appears, one individual that went undetected as a consequence of a failure of management and other internal controls of the most basic kind. Management failed at various levels and in a variety of ways . . . to institute a proper system of internal controls, to enforce accountability for all profits, risks and operations, and adequately to follow up on a number of warning signals over a prolonged period.</PARA>
<PARA>In March 1995 the Futures Industry Association held its annual international futures industry conference in Florida. During that meeting the FIA formed a global task force on financial integrity to examine the safeguards and control mechanisms that exist in the industry. That task force has since made 60 recommendations directed at regulators, exchanges, brokers and customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1995 representatives of regulatory bodies from 16 countries, including the Australian Securities Commission, met at Windsor in the United Kingdom. The result was the Windsor declaration, which outlines measures aimed at strengthening the supervision of international futures markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the committee's hearings, the Sydney Futures Exchange reviewed its procedures in light of the Barings collapse. It has advised the committee that: the SFE has decided to require members of the exchange to report the details of the holders of every position daily; the SFE clearing house has decided to increase the minimum net tangible asset requirement for members from $2 million to $5 million; and the SFE will shortly be making a submission to the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee concerning changes which the exchange believes should be made to the Corporations Law in order to bring it into line with best international practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SFE was, of course, involved in the Florida meeting of the Futures Industry Association. The SFE was also involved in the development of recommendations by the Futures Industry Association's global task force on financial integrity. The SFE has advised the committee that it meets all of the recommendations of that task force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporations and securities committee is not the only committee to have examined derivatives. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration has conducted public hearings on derivatives with the Reserve Bank and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. It recently tabled its report on those hearings in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on the evidence given during its hearings, the committee can see no reason for new legislative restraints of the use of derivatives at this stage, but will continue to monitor developments. Similarly, the committee saw no reason for restricting the development of new products provided that an appropriate regulatory regime is in place, active consideration is given to the need for suitable limitations on the level of exposure of individual users, and the nature of the product and the potential risks involved are adequately publicised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence given to the committee did not indicate that urgent changes to the Corporations Law were needed. However, it is clear to the committee that the comprehensive review of the Corporations Law being conducted by CASAC is appropriate and timely. In particular, the division of the regulation of markets into two separate chapters of the Corporations Law appears to be inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's hearings were stimulated by four main areas of concern: firstly, to ensure that the Corporations Law has kept up to date with developments and provides a suitable regulatory environment for derivatives trading; secondly, that regulators and market operators are aware of the full range of hazards involved in derivatives trading and are able to ensure, as far as possible, the overall integrity of the markets; thirdly, that market participants are aware of the hazards involved in trading these products; and, finally, that the superannuation savings of Australians are not placed at risk by derivatives trading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears to the committee that the SFE, the ASX and the ASC are all actively reviewing the way in which the markets operate in Australia in the light of overseas experience and are seeking to effect best practice in Australia. The committee believes that the parliament should be kept informed on derivatives and has therefore recommended that the ASC include in its annual reports a synopsis of the types and volumes of derivatives being traded in Australia and recent regulatory developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is of the view that the primary responsibility for ensuring that individual businesses do not fail as a result of losses on the derivatives markets rests with the management and directors of those firms. Page 3 of the committee's report lists examples of losses sustained by both Australian and overseas businesses. They should serve as a salutary warning for Australian businesses of the consequences of becoming involved in derivatives trading without having both an adequate understanding of the products and the necessary management and internal controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although some efforts are being made to educate users of derivatives, the committee remains concerned that users of these products, including executives and directors of Australian companies, managed funds, trusts and individual investors, may not be sufficiently aware of the potential hazards of using derivatives. Further efforts to educate the users of these products are essential. The committee considers that more publicity needs to be given by the ASX, the SFE and the ASC to the risks involved in using derivatives and the need for corporations using these products to have adequate controls in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's final concern is that the superannuation savings of Australian workers may be placed at risk through derivative trading by fund managers. The report of the House of Representatives banking committee, following its hearings with the ISC, has served to demonstrate that this issue has not yet been adequately addressed by the industry. The committee believes that the use of derivatives in the superannuation industry is an issue which must be closely monitored. In the committee's view, the most appropriate parliamentary body to consider this area in a comprehensive, ongoing way is the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Since the Barings Bank collapse and the considerable publicity given to the dealings of Mr Nick Leeson, and certainly since his apprehension in Germany and imminent transfer to Singapore as a result of charges being laid against him, derivatives and the mumbo jumbo associated with them have had a good deal of airing but sadly there has been very little understanding in the wider public of what is a widely accepted form of trading. People need to remember that, for all that so much money was lost in that instance, somebody made a profit on the deal; the money did not just disappear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of futures and commodity options trading, as the introduction to the report states, is one of the more impenetrable of humanity's concepts. It involves selling what one does not own and, as a rule, buying what one does not want. But at the same time it is a very important form by which you can hedge a commodity which you do own and may wish to sell at some uncertain future time in a market over which you have no control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this report, introductory though it may be&mdash;in that it is very difficult to cover the full ramifications of the subject&mdash;does serve to indicate to the public at large that the parliament is aware of the nuances of the derivatives trade and at the same time does not impose what I would see as new disciplines or restraints in restricting their future development and use. In Australia there have been many traders, some of whom have lost large sums of money on foreign exchange. The development of the derivatives instrument, particularly through the Sydney Futures Exchange, has enormous potential in future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lessons of the Barings Bank collapse we have attempted to identify to some degree. As the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), the chairman of the committee, has identified, there have already been quite a number of conferences nationally and internationally trying to identify ways by which there can be better communication and a better understanding of the futures, so that hopefully the Barings type collapse will not be repeated. It is inevitable that in commodities of this sort, where there is so little control, there are going to be losses. Indeed, I noted only last week that Westpac has been involved in some losses in a market that is not dissimilar, again through using an overseas agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the parliament's point of view, there are three things that I think are important. The first is that we believe internationally, to the maximum, there should be communication between exchanges of a person, individual or corporation at any stage once they have passed what might be the reasonable limitations or operation of a particular trading unit. If that is done and communicated between international operators, there would not be the breaches that occurred in the Barings affair where demonstrably neither the Singapore nor Osaka exchanges traded information between each other, let alone with other trading organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there needs to be adequate supervision, and in Australia that needs to be done by the trading authorities. Following our discussions, I am satisfied that both the Sydney Stock Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange conduct that proper prudential supervision of those who operate in their markets. But there also needs to be a watch kept by the Australian Securities Commission. By doing that, we believe there is a capacity for the public to feel confident in the way in which futures trading is being processed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recommended in the report that the ASC include in its annual reports to parliament a synopsis of the types and volumes of derivatives being traded in Australia and recent regulatory developments. That is with the specific intention of instructing the public at large on the nature of derivatives trading and, where new derivatives are developed&mdash;there is no doubt that they will be&mdash;there will be an understanding of what has happened in the derivatives market over the last 12 months. I believe that, by tabling the ASC's report with a reference to derivatives, there is a much better chance of people understanding a little of where the derivatives arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there should be no feeling by those engaged in the market that the legislature should just introduce a legislative restraint against the development of new instruments, because it is a particularly important way by which the market itself can be served. As markets change and as the volatility of exports and imports continues, in spite of&mdash;and perhaps even because of&mdash;the freeing of world trade, APEC, the consequences of the GATT resolutions and the establishment of the World Trade Organisation, it is important that there be new products so that people can enter into some greater certainty in their operations. That is ultimately, from the hedging point of view, one of the major functions of derivatives. There are speculators, but if there were no speculators there could not be essentially a hedging operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So education is necessary, the development of new products is necessary, proper regulatory supervision is necessary and communication between market operators is essential&mdash;market operators in the sense of the Sydney Futures Exchange, the Australian Stock Exchange and the like. This report deals with each of those. I believe that the report makes a worthwhile contribution towards a better understanding of where the Australian market is with respect to derivatives at this time and I trust that the recommendations can be adopted by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 4.11 deals with superannuation savings and derivatives trading. The committee has recommended that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation might be an appropriate instrument to monitor this trading. I hope that does not mean that the ASC does not feel that it too can report should it believe it is necessary to comment. There are a number of instrumentalities operating in that field and there is some prudential supervision from the Australian Treasury. I believe that the ASC needs to take note, as well as the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, of any area where they believe superannuation savings may be at risk. I commend the report to the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a joy to see the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) in the chamber. He was at the table when I started this speech more than three weeks ago, so it is as if we had not moved. On that occasion I dealt with one part of the bill, and that was to do with the mature age allowance. I was privileged to have a hand in those amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next issue I would like to address is carers. It is important to note that this government has done a great deal for carers. It has taken some time in historic terms to recognise the fact that so many people&mdash;husbands, wives or, a lot of the time, elder daughters&mdash;have stayed at home to look after the ill, the frail, the aged and the disabled; but now those carers are getting the kind of recognition they deserve. The carer pension is the main means by which we recognise those people, as well as training courses, respite and other measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This social security legislation makes three basic amendments to the provisions for carers. The first is to extend the carer payment for 14 weeks after the person being cared for enters an institution and the carer no longer has that person in their charge. This is designed to give carers time to adjust to no longer being in that caring role and, where required, to re-enter the labour market or to make appropriate arrangements to go onto other payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former carers who register with the CES during that 14-week period will be able to exercise the jobs education and training program, JET, during the following 12 months. The JET program, as we all know, is a very successful program and is designed simply for sole parents. It has been very successful in getting people back into the work force and into training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second measure is to extend carer payments to those who are caring for people not currently on a Social Security or Veterans' Affairs pension. Until now, that has been a requirement. This is very important because there are a number of people&mdash;particularly disabled people&mdash;who, because of the assets test and other requirements, are not on the pension but are not by any means rich. So it has allowed their carers to access the carer pension. The third one lifts the requirement that a carer live on the same premises or in adjoining premises. This will allow more people to have access to a carer. Those carers, of course, still have to meet the normal requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next item in the report that I would like to allude to is extended deeming. I think previous speakers have talked about this and I have no doubt that others will as well, because it is something of a central core of this bill. It deals with the way managed investments and shares are assessed for pension purposes. The previous system of assessing the growth in those investments as income was very complicated. It involved a lot of different formulas and complications which a lot of older people found very difficult to understand and to come to terms with. They simply got a piece of paper from Social Security saying that their pension had dropped to a certain level because there had been a certain amount of growth in their investments, and so on. I think that just about every member of this House would have had complaints from people about it. I feel it was so often unfair. The new system of extended deeming will bring simplicity. We all know that it has been introduced as a result of wide consultations throughout the industry and amongst age care groups, peak bodies and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> John Barber was commissioned to do a report and make certain recommendations. On that basis the current legislation has arisen. What this system does initially is create a standard deeming rate of five per cent which will apply to the first $30,000 of financial investments for single people and to the first $50,000 for couples. Above these amounts, the standard deeming rate of seven per cent will apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It means that those who have earnings below that amount are able to keep it; it will not be taxed as far as Social Security is concerned. Pensioners will get a full pension under the income test where their only income is from financial investments worth less than $43,000 for single people and $74,000 for a pensioner couple. This is because a single pensioner can earn up to $2,444 a year and a pensioner couple can earn up to $4,264 without it affecting their pension. That means a great deal of freeing up. This has been well received by all the groups concerned. It means that some people will want to change their portfolio of investments. The financial information service at the Department of Social Security is ready to give them advice. Those FIS officers at DSS offices do a very good job in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next issue I would like to talk about is the revised pensioner loans scheme and the advance payments scheme. Both these schemes allow people on pensions and other benefits to get a loan or advance payment for a special reason. We all know that when people are living on a tight budget and something goes wrong&mdash;the fridge breaks down, the roof leaks, the car needs major repairs and so on&mdash;that tight fortnightly benefit simply does not allow that job to be done when it needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the pension scheme, a loan can be taken out against the pension and be repaid or recovered from the estate when the person is deceased. The revisions to that mean that the fortnightly rate of the loan will be increased to the maximum pension rate or a rate specified by the pensioner, whichever is lower. Participants will have to be entitled to some payment under either the income or the assets test and the assets over which the Commonwealth will place a caveat will be limited to real estate. There are other conditions as well which I will not go into in detail, because of limited time. But these loans do certainly give relief to people who do not have access to ready cash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the lump sum advances are concerned, these often apply to people who are on jobsearch allowance and need some cash in order to prepare themselves for a job. There are people who need tools, clothing or some other things to prepare themselves for work, as well as people who need money for those emergency payments that I mentioned. The changes here are that the maximum advance available would be the lesser of $500 or six per cent of one year's pension payments. The advances are repaid by deductions from ongoing fortnightly pensions over 13 fortnights. Those measures are an advance to help people on very limited social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The earnings credits scheme is very important to people on jobsearch or newstart allowances. There are a lot of people who are looking for work but who are, at the same time, doing occasional part-time or casual work and gaining some work experience. All these people are allowed a certain amount of free cover each fortnight. They are allowed to do a certain amount of work and, after that, they progressively lose their benefits. Some fortnights some of those people may not use that free area; at other times they may exceed it. So the system of earnings credits allows them to accrue those amounts. If you go without using it for three weeks, you have three or four weeks up the next time around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three changes to this scheme. The first is that the credit will accrue at a rate equal to the amount of the unused free area in any fortnight. Secondly, the maximum amount of the credit that can be used in any fortnight is limited to $100, regardless of the earnings amount; and the earnings credit balance will not be able to be used on return to full-time employment. In other words, it is only for the time that the person is on that benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Flexibility in reporting for unemployed people is also very important. I am sure every member has had people complain about having to be at the CES on a certain day to hand in their form. I know the various Social Security officers can allow a certain discretion but this is now being freed up more so there can be variable reporting frequencies for people in particular situations. These include people who are currently being case managed. This system was brought in with Working Nation for the long-term unemployed. They have a case manager who is working directly with them, helping them to find training, work or work experience. Those people can be allowed more flexibility in their reporting time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customers undertaking certain kinds of activity can also be allowed more flexibility. These people include those in formal training, those doing short courses, those doing voluntary work and those who are in some way incapacitated. I think voluntary work is extremely important. It was one of the things I raised with the committee developing the green paper on employment, which eventually resulted in the white paper Working Nation. I have in my electorate quite a number of older people who find it difficult to find work&mdash;in fact, they know they are not going to find work, particularly locally&mdash;so they put themselves into voluntary work. There is a lot of voluntary work that can be done in the community with the aged, with children and so on. So those people will not have to report quite as frequently. I think that is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third group to be allowed more flexibility is customers aged 50 years or over transferring from a pension who have been on a pension for at least 12 months. The carers I mentioned earlier would come within that category. If they cease to be carers and go back into the labour market, they can also have that flexibility in reporting. I think that is another important move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last issue I will talk about is that of labour market programs. Currently, trainee payments under labour market programs are not counted as income if the person is receiving social security payments. The exemptions here have been expanded to include a payment made to a trainee in part-time training or part-time work experience under a labour market program. The payment is made to cover expenses associated with participation in the training or work experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we need to do those things in order to encourage people to go into labour market programs which are going to lead them into work. We often hear people saying, `If I go into a labour market program and I have to travel and incur other expenses then it is not going to be worth my while.' I think we need to support those people and I think the labour market programs this government has instituted have done a great deal, particularly for young people&mdash;getting them into the work force, gaining confidence and self-esteem, and getting themselves in a position where they can take on a full-time traineeship or a permanent job. I commend the bills to the House. There are plenty of other things in them which have not been covered, but for me I think those are the main points. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The content of these two social security bills is very important to a great many Australians. I think we should make the point right at the outset that a criticism we in the opposition have relates to the timing of the bills themselves. From the first reading to the commencement of the second reading debate there were only eight days. That did not leave very much time for the sort of consultation that should be undertaken, particularly with regard to the government's extended deeming proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I totally support the amendment foreshadowed by the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock)&mdash;in particular, the `failure to draft the bill to include detail as to the timing and regularity of valuation of financial investments under the extended deeming rules introduced in schedule 1 of the bill'. I will certainly come back to that in a little while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely important for the House to note and the people of Australia to be aware that some 207,000 pensioners will suffer a decrease in their pension if they do not rearrange their assets to meet or exceed the deeming rates. Two hundred and seven thousand Australian pensioners will suffer a decrease in their pensions unless they undertake, in some cases, very complicated efforts to rearrange their assets and their investments. It is also important that the House be aware that this legislation really fails to address the potentially adverse impact of the extended deeming rules on the holders of investments in friendly societies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the complexity of this social security law is such that what is intended to be simple and easy for ordinary people to understand is totally impossible for ordinary people to understand. The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill contains 229 pages. The other bill contains 167 pages. These bills are very complex. In fact, they add to existing law which is already very complex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can foresee that very big difficulties will be happening daily for a great many Australians. Independent people have made comments about that. The Ombudsman has drawn attention to it, as has the Auditor-General. Of course, the welfare rights movement has voiced its concern over a long period of time about the complexity of the social security system. These bills have more than 40 amendments, some relating to extended deeming. To put them in so late in the session I think is totally inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation needs to be understood very clearly. We in the coalition have pledged to repeal the unfair unrealised capital gains provisions and have criticised the government for the unfair nature of the provisions under which people's pensions go up and down on a fairly ad hoc basis according to changes in the share market. This has created an enormous amount of uncertainty and hardship for a great many people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that we are having these changes because the government did not get the money they expected. Therefore, they are going to have to make a change. The new system of calculating the income involves income and financial investments at a deemed rate of five per cent up to $30,000 for single people and up to $50,000 for couples, and seven per cent thereafter. The mere fact of that will ensure that the government saves money out of the budget. In fact, it expects to save something like $70 million in both the social security and veterans' affairs areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does a government save money in social security and veterans' affairs? It can save money only by removing people from entitlements. So the government is planning to harvest $70 million from the elderly of this nation. It is an absolute disgrace. Pensioners will lose their eligibility for fringe benefits or their eligibility for pensions or part pensions as a result of this measure. That is why the government will be saving something like $70 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has said all along that the new deeming rules are attractive because they will create certainty, but people's deeming rates will move up and down depending on the valuation of their assets. People will undoubtedly have great difficulty understanding why the deeming rates, which are fixed, are going to result in a change in the actual amount. The act, when it is amended, will not tell us how often that valuation is to take place. We on the coalition side expect that the valuation will occur at times of the government's choosing&mdash;to the best advantage of the government and not of the pensioners and allowance receivers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, people are required to notify the department each time the value of their assets changes, and their pensions are adjusted accordingly. There are penalties involved if people fail to advise the department of a change that could lead to a debt. This matter of changes in valuation will be a particularly important one. There is still great uncertainty. There are no administrative arrangements in place. Certainly we in the coalition have not been advised of any. There is no proposal for any rules. It is all extraordinarily vague and uncertain indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make brief reference to the issue of friendly society bonds. There have been a number of representations from friendly societies and from the umbrella organisation, the Australian Friendly Societies Association. They believe that provision should be made to treat prepaid investments, such as friendly society bonds, differently from products on which tax is not prepaid but on which the investor pays tax at their own marginal tax rate. They argued, quite reasonably and rationally I think, that returns from prepaid tax products would necessarily be lower as the tax has been paid prior to the distribution to the investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These organisations believe that their members will be adversely affected because these new extended deeming arrangements will be prejudicial to them. The association claims that there are something like 400,000 pensioners with total investments of $2.8 billion. So it is a very significant issue and one which should be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn briefly to the earnings credit scheme. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be fully aware that this is the scheme for people who only work a very short time but who might earn a significant amount in that period. The common example used is that of Father Christmases and Santa Clauses who get employment in the December period. They earn a fair bit at that time. The earnings credit scheme allows them to spread their income over a longer period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These new amendments are designed to remove a number of people from eligibility for the full earnings credit to which they are now entitled. Again, the government is going to make savings of $93 million. But where will those savings come from? They will come out of the pockets of pensioners who are able to earn a bit in a prime period and who, under the old rules, could then average that out so that they would not lose their entitlements. But for the government to save $93 million means that the government will rip $93 million out of pensioners. I can never agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People need to understand that earnings credit scheme. I repeat that it provides an opportunity for people who have seasonal occupations with a very high level of income at a particular time to apply that credit over time so that their earnings&mdash;the normal allowance is $60 per fortnight&mdash;do not reach a level where their benefit is affected. That is a reasonable thing to do. That is what a caring and compassionate government would do. To be fair, this is what the present government has done in the past. All of a sudden, to try to balance the budget, it will rip $93 million off the elderly of Australia. I can never endorse that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch briefly on the guardian allowance. The government announced in the budget that the guardian allowance would increase by $4 per fortnight as from September 1996. The May 1995 budget announced that guardians would receive an extra $4 per fortnight, or $2 per week&mdash;how generous!&mdash;but that the government will delay it for 16 months and not introduce it until September 1996. Examine the budget closely and all the provisions made by this government. It will spend $100 million on this or $40 million on that, but you always have to look at the date of commencement. Time and again, you will find that it is way down the track and that the amount is spread over three, four, five, six or eight years. Again, it is part of the pea and thimble trick that they are playing on the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the guardian allowance is concerned, ACOSS has been very active in saying that since 1973 the real value of the guardian allowance has dropped by 48 per cent. There has not been a real increase in the allowance since 1986. We are now getting an extra $2 per week from September 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also very concerned about the changes in rent assistance. On the one hand, you have the announcement&mdash;everybody would say that it is great&mdash;that rent assistance is to be increased by $5 per fortnight for families with children. Bravo! Great! Families with children get an extra $5 per fortnight in rent assistance. On the other hand&mdash;this is not loudly trumpeted by the government&mdash;the rent assistance threshold will be increased by $5 per fortnight for everybody. That means that the threshold which their income has to meet will be raised before they will be eligible for rent assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall impact of those changes is that the government gets a net saving of $16.9 million over 3 1/4 years. You have $5 million a year being saved out of changes to rent assistance. Again, it is one of those confidence tricks. The government is going to increase it, but it will also make savings out of it. I repeat that the only way that any government can make savings in social security and social welfare is to cut it off and to take it out of the pockets of the people concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of this on older pensioners is that about 310,000 recipients will lose $3.75 a week as a result of the increase in the threshold. The pensioners of Australia will lose $3.75 per week. There are 310,000 of them. That is the way that this current government is treating the pensioners and the elderly of Australia. It is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer in particular to the carers pension. I have some constituents&mdash;I will not name them; I want to protect their privacy&mdash;who had great trouble with the funerals of the lady's parents-in-law, one of whom died on 19 November 1995 and the other on 14 January.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening to the cognate debate on these social security bills with great interest. Some of the members opposite appear to have newly developed an interest in social welfare matters. I do not mean the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), who has had an interest in these issues for quite some time, but a number of the opposition members who have spoken on this bill today, and earlier in the debate on this legislation, have been a bit far from this debate in years gone by.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the shadow minister for social security, the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), has played his usual trick of proposing a nonsensical amendment while both he and the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) continue to delay any progress in this area by proposing that the bill be referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for report. We have just heard a rather eloquent plea from the member for Cowper for this legislation to be enacted post haste, so I guess he should be talking to his own party and suggesting no good merit is to be achieved at all, except to delay the issue, by referring the matter to a Senate committee for a lengthy report which will probably improve the legislation not one jot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government in this instance is putting in place a piece of legislation that will help people like the person referred to by the member for Cowper. The legislation will enact some very important reforms to areas of the social security system. The majority of those measures were outlined in the May budget, so I am surprised that the member for Berowra and the member for Fisher in their earlier contributions were so uptight about having so little time to consider them. By the time we considered and passed the legislation at the snail's pace the member for Berowra wants us to, the people the member for Cowper referred to would not need some quick resolution by the Minister for Social Security because they probably would have passed on. For a lot of these reforms there is no time to lose. I would like to specifically speak about the provisions that relate to carers, as did the member for Cowper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people who are caring for others who are ill and who at this time cannot get a carers pension will be dramatically helped by this legislation. The bill means that a person who cares for another person can qualify for a carers pension even if the person being cared for does not get social security or a veterans pension. The carers who are in this situation will be able to get a carers pension as long as the person they are caring for has an income of less than $61,020 and assets of less than $559,250. I think that is a very generous interpretation and will ensure that a lot of people who are caring for relations or friends will be able to get this pension. It will not matter if the carer does not live in the same house or next door. They will be able to get a carers pension whereas previously they were disqualified for living elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now well known that carers are under enormous strain both emotionally and physically for the constant care and attention they give to the people they are helping. Respite care is now accepted as necessary for both carers and the people they are caring for. It is only sensible that carers have some break from the routine of caring, some life for themselves. If they can do this by not actually having to live in the same house as the person they are caring for, they should not be penalised by not being able to get the pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, this piece of legislation brings into the social security safety net those decent people in the community who are looking after someone who is not a relation, someone for whom they are just doing a very decent thing. It takes into account very much the role of neighbours and friends. It ensures that we see an expansion both of those people eligible to provide this care and of the payment to those who until now have been doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years I have taken a great interest in aged care, since the beginning of the home and community care program. That program was subsequent to a report that I oversaw as the chairman of the House of Representatives expenditure committee, which was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In a home or at home</EMPHASIS>. In those nine years or so, we have seen great advances in the quality of non-institutional care being provided for our elderly and others that require care. Care for the carers is yet another aspect of those advances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another forward thinking provision presented here is that carers will continue to receive the carers pension for another 14 weeks after the person they are caring for goes into a nursing home. As I briefly mentioned, with their own needs sometimes sacrificed for many years so they can care for someone else, carers often face problems of their own arising out of the care they are giving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give a hypothetical example of a woman who has been caring for her parents, first her father and then her mother, for over a period of maybe 20 years. Caring for her parents has been the primary focus of her life for those years. She gets a carers pension but, unhappily, the day comes when her father has probably passed on and her mother must move into a nursing home for specialised care. For such a woman, probably aged in her late 50s herself, to face not only the emotional trauma of moving her mother into a nursing home but also the immediate withdrawal of her supporting income is a heartless action. The government recognises this situation and with this legislation will ensure that such carers will have a reasonable time to adjust to their changed circumstances before they have to start living their own lives again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Together, these bills will achieve a great deal of positive reform to the social security safety net&mdash;increases in rent assistance and the guardian allowance, simplification of applications for family payment and child-care assistance, extension of data matching to continue to reduce the incidence of fraud and suspension rather than cancellation of pensions when pensioners leave Australia for fewer than 12 months. These are all sensible measures which will improve the quality and efficiency of welfare payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just mention the positive benefit that I see in the suspension of pensions rather than the cancellation of them when people leave the country for less than 12 months. I represent an electorate where nearly half the people who live there were born outside Australia. They often return to their country of origin for some time and find themselves in an invidious position when they return to Australia because they have to go and reapply for the pension. These people have worked in Australia for 20 or 30 years. This provision would make the situation more sensible for these people and less bureaucratic for the government. No doubt it would also result in cost savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate on these bills earlier, the member for Fisher tried to tell us that we would be thrashed at the next election because the government have widened the gap between the rich and the poor. If he is saying that the opposition intend to do more than the government have done over the last 13 years, I suppose the government would be interested in hearing how the opposition would do this. If it is the case that the member for Fisher is speaking for the opposition, they should show the Australian people how they intend to outperform the government in the social welfare area. The reality is that all the opposition would do if they had a chance would be to slash funding in the welfare area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 10 years ago I remember participating in a debate on a bill in this House which provided an increase in social security and welfare payments, including the introduction of the carers pension. In that speech, I referred to a speech by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) which he made to the National Press Club. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main cause of the blow-out in government expenditure in recent years has taken place in the welfare area . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The member for Bennelong does not like it when we refer him back to some of the things he said in the past. But looking at people's track records in terms of what they have said and done in the past is the best way of knowing what they are going to do in the future, particularly when they are not willing to tell you on the record what they are going to do. That is what the present Leader of the Opposition said 10 years ago when we first introduced this pension. At that stage, he thought that the main cause of the blow-out in government expenditure was in the welfare area. He made those comments a few years after being Treasurer. That blow-out is something that he accused us of being responsible for. He said that the implication was that the government needed to do something to cut the welfare budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are the opposition now saying that we are not doing enough in the welfare area and that they would do much more if they had a chance? I do not think that is so. So that they will have some idea of what the benchmark is, they should be reminded of some of the government's achievements. At present, the government spend almost $3 billion a year on aged care, which is 62 per cent more than the coalition government spent when the member for Bennelong was Treasurer. The government continue to maintain the age pension at 25 per cent of weekly earnings, and have done since 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1975 and 1983, under the member for Bennelong's government, the real value of unemployment benefits decreased by 18 per cent and age pensions decreased by two per cent. Spending on community care services has tripled under this government. All up, the government currently spend nearly $30 billion a year on the social wage. They spend $30 billion a year on that social security and social wage safety net, which includes health, housing, child care and education. That is an average of around $200 per week for a family with two children. That is the benchmark that the opposition would have to achieve if they seriously thought they could improve on the current situation that the government have implemented. I do not think that the opposition could match that benchmark. I am astounded that people on the other side could presume to criticise the government for what we have done in the welfare area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to have a real debate on this issue, what we need is for the opposition to tell us what they intend to do. We do not want to hear the ridiculous proposal that they want to send the bills off to a Senate committee or that the government are moving too quickly. What we need to get from the opposition is some idea of where they stand. What would they do with the $30 billion a year that the government spend on the social wage? Does the member for Bennelong still believe what he said when we first introduced that carers pension at the National Press Club; that is, the budget blow-out problem was in the welfare area?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition have to understand the point raised by the member for Cowper: there are a lot of people out there who need the support of the government to go about their daily lives. It is not so much that they need the support of the government, because all the government are doing is redistributing income from their fellow Australians. I believe this pension is a very good example of the type of social security system that the government want to see in Australia. It is a system that provides equity and assistance to help people care for others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition should be positive about this issue. They should help the government to get on with this provision. They should not hold up the legislation by threatening to move amendments or to send the bills off to a Senate committee. It will only ensure that it takes longer for this legislation to become law and that the benefits that could be paid to those decent people to whom the member for Cowper referred will be delayed even further. I commend the bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A network of social support and social reform has become an obligation undertaken by all governments. It is part of our fabric of society and it has become an expectation of Australians that they be recognised and supported in times when earning a wage is not possible due to lack of employment, which has become quite common over the last 10 years or so under the Labor Party, illness, age, family commitments, and other `barriers'. Legislation and reforms in this area are therefore critical. I welcome the opportunity to discuss and debate the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would be remiss in representing my constituents of Cowan if I did not raise some concerns as to the manner of this legislation coming before the parliament. My fellow members of the House and I were initially given only eight days between the introduction of these bills and the second reading debate scheduled for the last week of sitting in October. In this time we were expected to digest, ponder and deliberate on what would best be described as complex, at worst, hugely difficult and, at times, convoluted pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills introduce more than 40 amendments to the act, and all this is couched within a mere 406 pages of important explanatory text. Fortunately, the second reading debate was deferred until today. I say `fortunately' for one reason, and it is not that it has provided my colleagues with more time to respond or prepare for the debate. Rather, it has allowed adequate time to bring to light an issue of great importance that had been all but overlooked by the government in its impetuousness, rush and childlike zeal to get these changes through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue concerns the gaining of vital feedback from the public&mdash;those people out there directly affected by the changes and the many organisations that represent differing groups on which these bills impact. But this is not my thinking alone. Our very own House of Representatives fact sheet, which was revised as of 1994, states in black and white:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This second reading debate is designed for one purpose&mdash;to consider the principles of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA>These principles can be appropriately considered only through consultation both within the party and among others and, of course, with adequate time. Yet here we are in the House today debating and trying to piece together not one but two bills to ensure the very best changes for the people of Australia without prejudice or favour. The same document also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The adjournment (between the first reading and the second reading speech) also provides the opportunity for public discussion and reaction.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask any reasonable person in the House today whether this could possibly happen in only eight days. I also ask whether this has taken place in the intervening three weeks between the last sitting when the bill was scheduled to be discussed and today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet again, if I were a mere onlooker I might assume that the Labor government is not really open to receiving public comment nor in any way interested in the views of Australians. However, I must point out that the government was aware of at least one inadequacy in these bills. It did a very smart back step in relation to the wife pension. Actually, `back step' is not correct&mdash;the government put into place yet another face-saving decision and reverted to fulfilling a commitment in this regard made back in 1994. I suspect that this change of thinking was not so much a direct reaction to community lobbying but, rather, a reaction to strong pressure placed upon the government by a most concerned opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the intricacies of the bills, without doubt the issues contained in these bills are of particular importance to my electorate and would be similarly important to other select electorates across Australia. However, boundaries aside, perhaps the most profound irony in these bills is that the people most disadvantaged from these proposed changes will be the traditional Labor voters, who I believe have been sold out majorly in these bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of my electorate of Cowan, representing Perth's northern corridor suburbs, will be profoundly affected by nearly all of the proposed changes. I represent a great number of pensioners, unemployed youth, youth, long-term unemployed and a reasonable number of people aged between 50 and 65. In addition, I represent a number of new suburbs comprising two-income families as well as a large number of other people using the services of child-care facilities. My electorate also has a mix of private dwellings, government housing and a significant proportion of rental properties. It is these good people and their representative groups who will be in the firing line of all these changes. These people deserve the very best of government support and rely on the government's judgment of fairness and equity in legislative reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was with this in mind that, as I critically read and interpreted these bills, I became deeply concerned about several specific issues in their contents. From my interpretation, the main issue in the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill is the introduction of a new extended deeming regime and the resulting repeal of unrealised capital gains. Such a repeal can result in only one outcome: no longer will many people's pensions be certain; these will now be somewhat floated like the dollar and are therefore likely to unfairly and unpredictably fluctuate. This may result in a lower than expected income at any one point for many pensioners. More importantly, it takes away much needed certainty for these people to plan and prepare for their financial future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any change creates uncertainty. When you link change of this nature to people's income base, there is sure to be widespread concern&mdash;if not mild panic in many cases. I suspect that the government will try to tell us that this fluctuation in payments is a good thing and keeps investments in touch with the current market situation. But let us face it: this argument is just another government red herring. This is all very well when the government is playing with words and throwing around insults and rhetoric in this chamber, but when it comes to interfering in the lifestyle and future of Australian people, the government needs to take stock of its responsibility and carefully think about what such changes really mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The baseline is that the people need to know. Pensioners affected by this change have a right to know their financial position at any one point in time. I am sure I am not alone in thinking that this is both a reasonable and rational request. The pensioners of Australia have really been put through enough without the necessity for this to happen. Due to the speed of this legislation, many people will be caught on the back foot from this change, without sufficient time to understand, or be informed of, all changes and the actualities of what is to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change will not affect a small number of people; it will affect many hundreds of thousands of pensioners. Perhaps most importantly, of these people at least 207,000 pensioners will suffer directly through an actual decrease in their pension, unless they rearrange their assets to either meet or exceed these new deeming rates. Asking people to do this may be in the long term and in some cases necessary, even if unreasonable. Yet I ask: how long have pensioners to do this? The bill, as I see it, fails to include any detail as to the timing and regularity of the valuation of pensioners' financial investments and therefore leaves all those affected somewhat at a loss to adequately plan for their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to why this change is being made, one has only to realise that the government did not receive the revenue expected from the previously determined test, and this has been the case since this test was introduced in 1992. In the three or so years since that time, there has been no steady rise in the value of investments. Therefore, the hidden revenue gains have not been realised. However, this is just one of the many issues to be discussed today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that I can present the views of my electorate on each issue, I have taken the liberty of using a slightly different approach in the House today. I will provide the House with the shortened title of each change, highlight the issues deemed important and, finally, give my summation on each of the points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I would like to raise is the earnings credit scheme. It is an important and valuable scheme in that it essentially encourages people to seek part-time work. Fine. It is a great initiative, one with across-the-board appeal. But&mdash;and there is always a but&mdash;overall this scheme is particularly underutilised at the moment. People do not understand how it works, and with the proposed changes it is even less likely to be understood or in fact used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who can and do use the scheme, the changes will actually disadvantage those people who are willing to put in a few extra hours and earn a little bit more during a particular fortnight. It is not a great boost or incentive to those who have had the opportunity to earn an occasional extra dollar&mdash;and I stress `occasional'. It is very much like the Father Christmases who will be appearing in stores and shopping centres over the next couple of weeks prior to Christmas. Their only income is occasional. It happens to be once every year, so I guess they fall into this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I read this particular set of changes, I felt that such a scheme would only widen the distinction between those on pensions and those on benefits, as this change affects only those Australians receiving allowances and not benefits. As for my overall assessment, it is a program underutilised at present; with changes, even less likely to be utilised. So I ask: what is the point?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point is the amalgamation of the jobsearch and newstart allowances. This is another initiative that looks great on paper yet is really another smokescreen to hide the real numbers of long-term unemployed in the queues for jobs. Already we have seen the government stop publishing youth unemployment figures by area, and this further change now provides an opportunity for figure fudging for the long-term unemployed as well. This figure fudging will come at a cost, albeit a somewhat hidden cost. For a change such as this, there need to be administrative changes in government in many areas&mdash;such as in staff training, computer programming, forms and other print information and direct mail-outs, and the list really goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My overall assessment of this initiative is that it is an expensive smokescreen at best with little real value to anyone. I must say it is somewhat regressive, as this is how the system was back in 1991&mdash;some four years ago. The mature age allowance is yet another smokescreen designed to figure fudge the real numbers of those considered long-term unemployed. This will occur through the transfer of participants from the newstart program to this non-activity tested allowance. This would effectively stop some 20,000 people being listed in the unemployment statistics&mdash;not bad if you have something to hide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an aside to this point, my calculations of this change suggest that there is a real chance that many mature age beneficiaries may actually receive a reduced benefit. Overall, and in real terms, these mooted changes will make the system even more complex. My overall assessment of this particular change is that it is a smokescreen at best which will have effects on many people through a reduction of income. This may be considered a backward step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only that; through this change we are saying that people who are 55&mdash;in particular 60 and above&mdash;and who have something to contribute to the community will no longer be considered to be contributing to the community. The change tries to hive them off any scheme by putting them into this mature age allowance. Therefore, we are saying, `Look, you have done your best; see you later.' What happens to these people over the next 30 years while they are living in this great Australia? We just put them on the shelf and say, `Thanks a lot for your efforts, but we do not want you anymore.' This scheme promotes that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next is the guardian allowance. It seems that the government has proven to be dishonest yet again. In the 1995-96 budget the government announced that the guardian allowance would be increased by $4 per fortnight&mdash;$2 per week&mdash;as of September 1996. Great, fine, beaut&mdash;all those sorts of adjectives. But this increase has been delayed until two months after next year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This begs the question as to why it was announced so early. Why was it not left to the appropriate time? Was it announced so early because of electioneering? Was it due to an overzealous spokesperson? Or was it perhaps due to a little factional pressure? Who knows? Yet another of life's mysteries under a Labor government!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, my overall assessment of this amendment is that it really is part of a fairly mean trick played on the Australian people. First, an increase is announced and then deferred by more than 12 months. That is like parents saying to their children, `Hey, kids, I'll give you an increase in your pocket money, but you can't have it for another 12 months.' That is the way this government works&mdash;it announces something and then does not really instigate it. By the way, the government is undertaking all this coercion and these undercover deals over an increase of only $2 a week. That might sound mean-spirited and I think that is probably the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next amendment concerns rent assistance. This is too important an issue for too many people, certainly in my electorate and, accordingly, is an area which I treat with respect and great personal interest. On the surface, I was pleased when I realised that under this proposed change some 190,000 families would be better off. I am not one to criticise for the sake of criticism, and for this benefit I would gladly say thank you to the Labor government. But&mdash;and there is always a `but'&mdash;when I looked a little more closely, I was appalled to learn that 8,700 recipients will lose rent assistance as a result of the increase in the threshold. A further 310,000&mdash;more than 300,000 Australians already designated as needing assistance and support to sustain a comparable lifestyle&mdash;will lose up to $3.75 as a result of the increase in the threshold. This amount may seem insignificant here in this House away from the average Australian, but to many people this is a great amount, a very significant amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the way, the government also thinks that this amount is very significant and they have deferred a payment of $4 for the guardian allowance as being an unnecessary if not substantial amount to balance their blown-out budget. Yet here they are taking nearly the same amount of money away from rent assistance. It seems that they can take immediately without conscience, thinking that no-one will really feel the pinch, yet on the other hand hold back a very similar amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously this amount of $4 must be considered by the government as a significant change and worthy of mentioning in not one but two budgets. This Labor government that consistently espouses support for low income earners is potentially taking away roofs over people's heads, albeit tile by tile. As for my own overall assessment of this amendment, this is yet further slow erosion of working people's disposable incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really have not discussed all the issues in these bills and the task to do so is fairly enormous. I must stress to the House yet again my concern that members and others have not been afforded the privilege to provide a true assessment of these bills because of the government's insistence and pushiness. So I look forward to the community backlash in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly my electorate of Cowan is reeling after 13 years of Labor government. The people in my electorate require a change and one of the changes that they are looking for is in this social area. Earlier I was listening to the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) espousing the $30 billion a year we spend on what he calls the social wage. My own investigation indicates it is more like $42 billion. In fact last year, of the $120 billion we spent in Australia we only collected $108 billion, leaving us $12 billion or so short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But of that $120 billion, 50 per cent was in two areas: $42 billion on social security and $17 billion or so on health. These are two areas that take a lot of money from the taxpayer and I am sure that they are two areas that the taxpayer of Australia will continue wanting to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, over the last 13 years we have taken away people's self-worth and we have made them dependent upon the system. No greater evidence of this exists than in my own electorate where, daily, people come to see me for assistance to work through the bureaucracy of the department. Daily they complain about not receiving their appropriate benefits. Daily they complain about not having enough money to sustain themselves. Daily they come into my electorate office and complain about the Labor government's creation of this dependency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure, they place a lot of significance on their social wage. There is support for people on low incomes. But who created these low income people we have in Australia? Who has driven a greater divide between the rich and the poor in Australia? None other than the Australian Labor Party. They have to provide for people on low incomes, as any wealthy society should. We should provide for the underprivileged who need some help in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in Australia we spend $42 billion on the social wage. A lot of those people, I think, would prefer to be earning a salary out there with employment. My own view is that we should look after those who need help in Australia, but we should also create opportunity and hope for them, and we cannot do that whilst we have a Labor government. I support my colleague the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) in his amendments and I look forward to further debate on this particular issue. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of regret that these very complicated amendments to the act&mdash;some 40&mdash;have been brought into the parliament with the opposition having been given just on a week in which to respond. It is often difficult in those circumstances to make a complete assessment of who will benefit and who will lose from some of these measures. But it is already clear in the short time that this legislation has been available for public scrutiny that there are many losers from this particular range of measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the government's strategies lately has been to try to bring this sort of legislation in and out as quickly as possible in the hope that there will not be a full public awareness of some of the matters that are included in time for them to be subject to appropriate assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, these 40 amendments to the act will obviously make a wide range of changes but do nothing whatever to simplify what is a very complicated social security system. I have a great deal of sympathy for the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), who spoke about the people who regularly come to his office with social security problems. I have to say that my own experience is exactly the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system has become so unbelievably complicated that few can understand it. There is an urgent need to overhaul the entire social security system so that we have legislation that people can comprehend and find user friendly. Bear in mind that the sorts of people that use the social security system, the clients, are not generally trained lawyers. They are not the sorts of people that have outstanding expertise in dealing with government legislation and understanding the filling out of forms and all the other procedures associated with the social security arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would benefit everybody if the system could be simpler and there was a clear understanding of what people were entitled to so that they could access it easily. In addition, if the system were simpler there would be fewer loopholes, fewer gaps that people so often fall through and fewer people suddenly finding they are ineligible for a benefit they have received for a long time; changes made to the system that affect them and which upset their whole lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we have an act which currently has 1,200 sections and over 300 definitions covering 27 different pensions and allowances&mdash;legislation that is regarded by many as being even more complicated than the notorious tax legislation&mdash;is it any wonder that this sort of confusion exists. The Welfare Rights Centre stated in a recent newsletter that there have been 39 amending bills with approximately 24,000 new clauses inserted into the act since the Social Security Act was introduced in 1991&mdash;24,000 clauses in a bit over four years! Is it any wonder people are aghast at the way in which this legislation operates?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The confusion does not just apply to the clients, although they are the ones who concern me the most; it is also a problem for the staff of the Department of Social Security. Frequently I come across occasions when clients say they were  not told something by Social Security staff that was relevant and important to their case. Frankly, it does not surprise me that, on occasions, Social Security staff would neglect to give a client some important piece of information; they are dealing with a lot of people but, what is worse, they are dealing with complex legislation which frequently even they have difficulty in understanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When there is an announced change by the government, it is rarely honest in the way it makes its announcements. It always trumpets the good points about proposed changes to the legislation, but it is always very quiet about how many people will be disadvantaged. That is one of the themes of my comments during the debate on this particular legislation tonight&mdash;the number of people who will be disadvantaged, in spite of the fact that the government puts out media releases which give the impression that everybody is a winner. Of course, when the government expects to save money from a measure, there is no way everybody can be a winner, and there are plenty of examples of that in this legislation tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose one of the surprises of the 1995-96 federal budget, and one of the most important elements of this bill, was the decision to extend the deeming regime to cover a wide range of pensioners' financial investments. It includes, I guess, one welcome admission from the government, and that is that they got it all wrong in the appalling pensioner unrealised capital gains on shares issue. I have spoken about this matter in this House on many occasions, drawing attention to the real anomalies that were created by that system. There was an outcry in the community about it, and rightly so. Many pensioners have adjusted their affairs to try to take account of those provisions, only now to be told that the government will dump them altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You could not have had any hint that the government was about to dump these procedures, particularly if you had listened to the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, now the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Sciacca. In this parliament he stood valiantly defending these measures, pointing out how great they were, what a wonderful thing the unrealised capital gains on shares test would be and of course that these gains should be counted in the income test. We never argued that they should not be included in the assets test as that was perfectly reasonable, but including them in the income test was in fact taking pensions off people for money they may never get, money which they certainly did not have to live on at the time. As far as the test was concerned, there was a clear inequity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the parliamentary secretary at the time went on radio and television and was in this parliament day after day defending those measures&mdash;I might note with a singular lack of support from his colleagues. Often he sat here alone&mdash;as is the current Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio)&mdash;with no-one behind him to defend him on these matters because I suspect his colleagues knew, as well as everyone else, that this was a proposal that was full of inequity, a proposal that gave no fairness to the social security system whatever, and so should never have been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, the parliamentary secretary defended it vigorously until finally the announcement came in the budget that it was to be dropped and&mdash;I thought in an absolutely monumental piece of dexterity&mdash;a few days later we had the same Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, who was by then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, boasting to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> in Brisbane that he was instrumental in bringing about the changes, that he was bringing in all the improvements to the system he had so vigorously defended for the previous year. I know that sometimes parliamentary secretaries have to defend causes they do not believe in but, if that was the case, the minister was a wonderful actor and certainly gave the impression that he believed very passionately in measures which he was quick to dump the next time around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a deeming provision, which will mean that a range of financial investments will be deemed to be earning income of five per cent or seven per cent, irrespective of the amount of earnings that they actually achieve. The extended deeming arrangements will mean that there will be a standard five per cent deeming rate for the first $30,000 of financial investments for single people and $50,000 for couples, and then above that a standard deeming rate of seven per cent will apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure has one considerable advantage and I acknowledge it freely: it is much simpler than the system that it replaces. It also has some element of fairness in that a wider range of investments are covered under the deeming provisions. But it still creates a whole series of inequities in itself. There is still a whole range of investments, including collections of French clocks and the like, that do not get counted. Certain real estate investments do not get counted. So it is still possible to have a capital gain and to have investments for which no income is counted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem that arises from any kind of fixed deeming arrangement of five per cent or seven per cent is that obviously it creates an incentive for pensioners to invest their money in measures that are likely to return the maximum possible gain. If you are looking for something that will have the highest interest rates, there is also the greatest risk. So, whilst those investments may return 10 or 12 per cent in good times, there may be other occasions when they return nothing at all. But that does not matter as far as the deeming provision is concerned; they will still be assumed to be earning five or seven per cent. So a poor pensioner with some bad investments will not only lose money on their investments and be out of pocket so far as the earning potential of the investments is concerned, but will lose out again because they will be deemed to be continuing to receive an income from those investments. They will be in double jeopardy: they will lose not only the income from their investments but also their pension entitlement. On the other hand, there may be good days when they earn 10 per cent, substantial amounts of extra money, but get to keep their pension. So there is a degree of anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government argues that this measure is attractive because it creates certainty. There is some degree of additional certainty over the previous capital gains on shares system, but there is by no means absolute certainty, because the value of the investments will go up and down and therefore the deeming amount counted against them will vary from month to month. We do not know very much about what the valuation procedures will be. I hope pensioners will not be up for huge costs in establishing the value of any of their investments. But, whatever the valuation arrangements, they will clearly change from time to time and that change will be outside the control of the individual pensioner. So he will still face variations in the amount of pension entitlement depending on the valuation of those investments. So the quite laudable motives of achieving certainty and achieving simplicity are not completely achieved in these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures themselves are quite interesting. I am not quite sure where the government got its idea to introduce this wider range of deeming provisions. It did commission, at great expense to the taxpayers, the Ageing Agendas report. Pensioners and organisations spent a great deal of time and effort to make submissions to that inquiry in the hope that it would lead to significant changes. But the report rejected the vast majority of the submissions, many of which were leading towards some kind of universal pension entitlement, and simplicity in the system. The report rejected that approach and the government has now rejected most of the recommendations of the Ageing Agendas report. These deeming provision changes are certainly not in accordance with what Ageing Agendas recommended. So that report was clearly a waste of money and a waste of effort on the part of all those people who put so much work into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about the real effect of these new deeming arrangements. The government announced them as being of great benefit to pensioners. We were told not only that the system would be simpler and easier for people to understand but also that thousands of pensioners&mdash;hundreds of thousands even&mdash;would be better off financially as a result of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where they did not level with the Australian people, and what they did not tell the pensioners, was that they expect to save $62.58 million in 1996-97 as a result of these measures and $65.02 million in 1997-98. Pensioners are going to be better off, we are told, but the government is going to save over $60 million a year. What they did not own up to and what has only come out with much more detailed scrutiny is that 270,000 pensioners and part pensioners are going to suffer a decrease in their pensions as a result of this measure&mdash;270,000 pensioners will be worse off. That should have been the banner headline if we had a truthful and honest government telling us what was happening as a result of these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already had in my office one pensioner, who is astute and clearly aware of his own financial affairs, who has said to me that he will go from receiving a full pension to getting none at all as a result of this single measure. I acknowledge that in most circumstances the effects will not be that drastic. But 270,000 pensioners will be worse off as a result of these deeming provisions. That needs to be taken into account in any assessment of the merits of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other proposals as well, some of which, ironically, reverse or change decisions that the government made only a very brief period ago. The mature age allowance, which was to be axed on 30 June 1996, is to be extended but significant changes are to be made to those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make some comments on the guardian allowance, which has to be the most mean-spirited announcement that a government has made in a budget in years. The government has announced that there will be a $4 per fortnight increase in the guardian allowance. It needs to be remembered that since 1973 the real value of the guardian allowance has dropped by 48 per cent. The value of the allowance has gone down by 48 per cent since 1973. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has not been a real increase in the allowance since 1986. Now the government, with great fanfare, announces that there will be a $4 per fortnight increase. That seems pretty miserable and mean-spirited. But that is not all. The increase is not actually going to commence until September 1996&mdash;not until after the next budget, not until after the next election. Anybody who can remember the l-a-w tax cuts or anything of that nature would hardly be counting their $4. It has to get through another whole election, through another budget. Then, two months after the scheduled time of the next budget, the $4 per fortnight finally comes along. What a mean-spirited response to people who the government has acknowledged are needy. How much will this measure cost that it has to be delayed until 1996 before it can be introduced?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another measure of this nature. The government announced changes to the rent assistance arrangements, again giving the impression that it was being generous to people who are receiving rent assistance. We were told about the $5 per fortnight increase for families with children. But, again, when you start to read the fine print you find out that there are many losers. These increases in the rent assistance are actually going to save the government $16.9 million over 3 1/4 years. They are going to save $5.2 million a year from this rent assistance increase. That does not add up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once you look closely at the fine print you find that 190,000 families will receive up to $5 a fortnight extra, and that is to be welcomed. But 310,000 recipients will lose up to $3.70 as a result of the changes to the threshold arrangements and a further 8,700 will lose their entitlement to rent assistance altogether. So there are many more losers than there are winners. ACOSS has calculated that 135,000 recipients will benefit from the changes, the average change in weekly income a measly $2.40. But 365,600 recipients will lose as a result of these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the sorts of changes that are associated with this legislation. It adds 40 further amendments to an already unduly complicated piece of legislation. It is high time the government looked seriously at the effect of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation was delayed because the government abandoned its decision to withdraw wives pensions from many people who had been given an assurance in the previous budget that their wives pension would not be taken from them. There were to be no new grants of wives pensions after 1 July 1995. Then the government announced in the last budget that it was going to take the wives pension off many of the people who already received it. Finally, after widespread public criticism, the government backed down on these matters. But that has created an anomaly, too. You are left with people who once had an entitlement to a wives pension but who, because of the refusal to grant a new entitlement, will not be able to renew them. That needs to be addressed as well. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Many times in the course of this government we have heard it talk about unintended consequences. Surely we must ask whether there are unintended consequences in this legislation. The government must answer the questions that this amendment poses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), who spoke before me, made the point clearly that there are substantial losers under this legislation. The government simply cannot have it both ways. It cannot attempt to make a case out for the benefits of this legislation for pensioners at large when clearly there are losers&mdash;and there are losers simply because the government projects savings. If the government were to come in here and tell the truth up-front about its legislation, then that would not be a valid objection. But the fact is it does not do that. It attempts at every opportunity to gild the lily and tell us about the benefits. But there is clearly a substantial downside in this legislation for pensioners. The amendment that we have moved refers to the 207,000 pensioners who will suffer a decrease in their pension if they do not rearrange their assets to meet or exceed the deeming rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is certainly better late than never. The fact is that there are 207,000 pensioners who will suffer a decrease in their pension if they do not rearrange their affairs. Those few words are important because what we have had from this government over the years has been an attempt on many occasions to force pensioners to rearrange their affairs.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The whole process of taking into account unrealised capital gains on shares as income was an attempt to force pensioners to rearrange their affairs. That effectively forced pensioners to sell their shares. The former parliamentary secretary and now Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) admitted that&mdash;here in the parliament when we confronted him with the proposition of how they were to survive if they lost their pension&mdash;the answer was to sell their shares, rearrange their affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This legislation is a further attack on some of my aged constituents. It is a further attempt to force them to rearrange their affairs. What is the one thing that aged people are entitled to amongst all of their other entitlements? Surely it is certainty in retirement; surely it is the right that they have earned to have an enjoyable, relaxed and worry free retirement. Yet the one thing that this government has delivered constantly to aged people&mdash;whether they be pensioners, part pensioners or totally self-funded retirees&mdash;is uncertainty. This is just simply another step in the process of creating a climate of uncertainty. Why? The answer apparently is to save a few million dollars, $60 million-odd a year, to create uncertainty for 207,000 part pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard in the parliament today that the government proposes to give Vietnam $55 million to build a bridge. I do not want to get embroiled in an argument about the pros and cons of foreign aid but I want the people listening to know, and I want to be able to tell my constituents, that, on the one hand, the government is trying to save $60 million by taking away some of their pensions but, on the other hand, it is prepared to spend $55 million building a bridge somewhere in Vietnam. It is no wonder that average Australians are concerned when they hear of that sort of connection, because most of them believe that charity begins at home. I suspect that the 207,000 pensioners who are losing pension from this particular legislation would be quite entitled to believe that to be the case. The government is desperate to save money to balance its budget&mdash;which, of course, it has not been able to do. In its desperation, the government is prepared to engage in this ultimately penny-pinching exercise to force 207,000 pensioners once again&mdash;goodness knows how many times the pensioners have had to do it&mdash;to rearrange their affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am pleased that the government has backed down on that totally unacceptable system of taking into account unrealised capital gains on shares. The member for Wide Bay, who spoke before me, and I constantly berated the government over that totally inequitable, unfair and unreasonable attack on pensioners. I am not yet convinced that the deeming is going to be satisfactory, although at least it seems to have the merit of being easier to calculate and easier to understand for most people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, I still believe that deeming is flawed. While I am quite happy to accept the concept of adequately targeting benefits, and we on this side understand the importance of doing that, I am not sure in the end that deeming&mdash;it is, in a sense, ad hoc in the effect that it has&mdash;is going to be entirely fair to everybody. That is a substantial concern that I have about the proposal. Also, many secure and desirable investments may not be able to deliver the returns equal to or more than the deeming rates that are proposed. The deeming rates will change as prevailing interest rates move up and down. This will make it more difficult for pensioners to make long-term decisions about their retirement incomes. They need to make long-term decisions if they want to have certainty in retirement years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of that particular question and the question that the government really needs to answer is that no provision has been made in this legislation&mdash;there appears to be no answer available when you ask the question&mdash;as to how assets are to be valued and at what point they are to be valued. Surely we on this side of the House are entitled to know that. Surely those who are going to be affected by this legislation are entitled to know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Another matter addressed in the foreshadowed amendment is the particular problem of deeming for friendly societies which offer tax paid investments. As I recall, it was not so long ago that this government was encouraging people to go into those sorts of investments. Now we have what amounts to an horrific retrospective change in the treatment of those particular investments for a large number of people; in fact, 400,000 pensioners have a total investment of $2.8 billion in friendly societies. They may not all be affected&mdash;it is not entirely certain how they will be affected&mdash;but the problem has been raised by the friendly societies. It is a valid concern and it needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not even seem to be aware of the problem. I hope that we on this side, the pensioners who are affected and the friendly societies which have flagged the concern quite openly will get some response from the government. At its very worst, it will force a very large number of pensioners to withdraw their funds from friendly societies or to rearrange their funds within friendly societies, which may cause serious liquidity problems for the various institutions concerned. I do not know whether the government is worried about that, but it ought to be because it is a question that has not been answered. We want to know exactly what the government intends to do about that particular problem, because it is a problem that needs to be solved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other issue that needs to be addressed&mdash;in fact, it has partially been addressed since this legislation was introduced&mdash;is the treatment of Meridian Investment Trust holders. We all know that these people were the original investors in Estate Mortgage management, which collapsed. They received their Meridian shares in exchange for very much diminished investments that they had in Estate Mortgage management. They were then faced with a change which effectively said that the value of their investment had increased&mdash;and so it had but from a very low base. Very few of them&mdash;in fact, none of them&mdash;would have got back to anywhere near their original investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here was a double whammy for these people under the current legislation. They were to be extremely badly affected by the taking into account of unrealised capital gains on their investments, when they were still substantially worse off as a result of their original investment in Estate Mortgage management. The government has apparently come back with a half-baked response. It does not go nearly as far as I believe it should. It agrees to make some ex gratia payment which in some small way may compensate holders of Meridian Investment Trust, but it does not go nearly far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister, the member for Berowra, stated our belief that these investments should be treated in such a way that full account be taken of the fact that these people had lost a considerable amount of money. We on this side of the House are not at all satisfied with the government's response. The government was dragged screaming into a response because the legislation, when it was originally introduced, did nothing to assist those people at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has taken 12 years to adjust the affairs of pensioners and it still appears to have got it wrong on many occasions.

Understandably, this gave the impression to everyone in the district that only public facilities would be allowed on North Head and that the public land would remain in public hands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at the hearing of evidence before the Joint Committee on Public Works a couple of weeks ago it became very clear that just about the only development that has been ruled out on North Head is the construction of a brand new shopping complex. In May of this year the government announced that it was going to close down the School of Artillery on North Head and move it to Puckapunyal. The government said that when the army left North Head it was government policy to sell the land on the open market. Quite rightly, this gave way to fears of high-rise buildings on some of the last undeveloped headlands around Sydney Harbour. It gave rise to fears of Club Med and Mirage Balmoral on North Head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since then, this government has been trying to reassure people that it would not do what it said it would do. In evidence to the public works committee a couple of weeks ago Brigadier McCann, a good officer&mdash;an officer who like all military men tells the truth&mdash;gave the lie to the protestations of the Minister for Defence. Brigadier McCann said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of the meaning of `no commercial development of North Head', this was seen to mean no new construction for commercial purposes of the land occupied by the School of Artillery.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that this definition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . could involve limited building alterations to enable the re-use of that land, including potential for low scale, medium density redevelopment. . . was an option to be further considered by the planning committee.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, existing construction can be used for virtually anything. It can be used for a hotel. It can be used&mdash;why not?&mdash;for a Club Med on North Head. This is the spectre that faces the people of Manly. According to the evidence presented by Brigadier McCann we could also be faced with a whole series of dual occupancy redevelopments. That means hundreds more people living on North Head and thousands more cars using this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It means that one of the last unspoiled headlands around Sydney Harbour is faced with environmental vandalism. The government's assurance that North Head land was safe in the hands of the Minister for Defence is about as believable as an assurance that the industrial relations system and industrial peace is safe in the hands of Dangerman, Laurie Brereton; about as believable as an assurance that truth is safe in the hands of the minister for memory loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that is not all. Barely a day after the opening of a monument to the defence of Sydney in the grounds of the artillery museum of North Head&mdash;an opening attended by 1,400 people, including the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) and the Governor of New South Wales&mdash;we had the revelation that not only was the government wanting to move the School of Artillery, but it wants to move the artillery museum as well. Obviously the monument will remain, but the whole context will be changed if the artillery museum goes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Sunday, 1,400 people in my electorate were saying to this government, `Please reconsider.' We have to ask ourselves why is there this indecent haste to privatise Sydney Harbour foreshore land. What deals have been done to drive this government to do this? Why on earth does the government want to vacate this land on North Head? Let us face it: how can Sydney be defended from Puckapunyal? Surely if there ever is any conflict in our region the city of Sydney will need to be defended, and it will need to be defended on site. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today petitions were presented to the House on behalf of 2,130 constituents relating to the re-establishment of a Medicare office in the suburb of Toukley. The petitions came from people right across the Wyong shire. They illustrate the anger and frustration of people at the decision of the Health Insurance Commission to close down the Medicare office on 25 August. Those petitions have the support of the general community including pharmacists, doctors and health professionals. The petitions tabled today read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain electors of the Division of Shortland draws to the attention of the House that residents of Toukley, Norah Head and Noraville have been seriously disadvantaged by the closure of the Toukley Medicare/Medibank office.</PARA>
<PARA>The petitions call on the Health Insurance Commission to re-establish Medicare-Medibank at Toukley. I know that those petitions will go forward to the Minister for Human Services and Health for consideration by her, but I want to say to the House and to the minister that my constituents want to see a relocation of that office of Medicare-Medibank in Toukley. I totally and absolutely support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 August 1995 Toukley Medicare-Medibank was closed by the Health Insurance Commission and relocated at the Lake Haven shopping centre. Last Wednesday, 16 November 1995, we had discussions at Toukley with officers of the Health Insurance Commission; with a representative of the medical practitioners in the Toukley area; with Nan Wenden, the president of the senior citizens club in Toukley&mdash;a club which has 5,000 members; with Mr Bill Simmington, the president of the Toukley Chamber of Commerce; and with Mr Rob King who is one of the leading pharmacists in Toukley and who was representing all the other pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that discussion it was clear that the Health Insurance Commission had made a decision to close the Toukley office and relocate it to the Lake Haven shopping centre, some five or six kilometres distant. The decision was based on information relating to population numbers and not in relation to the convenience of service offered to people of that area. The decision was based on postcode areas. Those involved had not looked at travel patterns and they had not looked at the complex of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in this House on 26 September, Toukley has the largest medical service complex in the Wyong shire. A couple of hundred metres away from that was the Medicare office. Surrounding those two offices&mdash;the Medicare office and the medical service centre&mdash;are seven different pharmacies. Here we have an absolutely convenient set of services to meet the needs of an ageing community, to meet the needs of people who have difficulty with public transport services, and to meet those needs as conveniently as possible. People would go to the medical services, then across to Medicare to get their rebate, and then to the pharmacies to get their pharmaceuticals. It worked very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision has been made without proper consideration of the interests of the people who use Medicare and medical services. It is causing great disruption and a great deal of anger among the people of the area. That is why we had the discussion last week to try to convince the people of the Health Insurance Commission that they had made a wrong decision. I think they have made a wrong decision. I read their signals that way. Their response was that they had budgetary problems, they made a decision and they cannot relocate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard what they said and our delegation heard what they said. But I say through you, Mr Speaker, and through this chamber to the minister, that what they have done is an affront to the people that I represent. It is a disruption to the convenience they had. It has made it much more difficult for people to get to their services and attend to their medical needs. I want the minister to direct the Health Insurance Commission to relocate a Medicare presence in Toukley. There are a number of ways to do this, but primarily to relocate a cash payment service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever they do, we want some kind of service re-established at Toukley to meet the needs of the people who live in that area and in recognition that there are some 30 general practitioners, 60 health professionals, 16 specialists and seven pharmacists, all within a matter of a few hundred metres, providing for the medical care needs of all the people in that region. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following on from this afternoon's events, I would like to comment on today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> editorial and put it in context with the statement by Senator Crichton-Browne on 15 November when he tabled his now notorious document, supposedly the defence against his expelling from the Liberal Party of Western Australia. Under the editorial heading `Senate shamed by MP's conduct' it is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Senator Noel Crichton-Browne is to be remembered for anything in WA's political history, it'll be for his single-minded determination to exercise power in the Liberal Party and his appetite for vengeance after he lost it.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same editorial it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Crichton-Browne was a shadowy figure to most Western Australians before the internal bickering of the Liberal Party erupted into public feuding this year. He was revealed to them as a manipulative in-fighter who represented much that is wrong in the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are very apt comments. I mentioned earlier that on 15 November he sought leave to table, and was successful, a document in which a number of assertions were made which are false, misleading or just plain wrong. This document was designed to be his defence to the charges that were laid against him in order to expel him from the party. It is ironic indeed that he has been hanged for the wrong offences. However, in his repetitive and self-seeking document, the senator alleged that he was innocent of interfering in the Moore, Curtin and Stirling preselections. I find this interpretation of recent history in the party highly interesting because, throughout the party's 20 years of internal civil war, the common thread has been the senator and his political activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this document the senator refers to a meeting that was held at which he, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) and I were present. He says in his report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When Cameron and Filing were confronted by myself and John Howard in the Leader's office about claims made by them to the leader that I was seeking to undermine their preselection, much to their embarrassment neither could give one name.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of that meeting, which was organised at our request, was for us to give the leader, in front of Senator Crichton-Browne, the reasons why we thought he ought not to be selected as the leader's representative on the state council, state executive and state management committee of the Western Australian Liberal Party. It was organised in full agreement with us. During that meeting the member for Stirling and I put forward the case, which we believed to represent the will of the vast majority of the members of the House of Representatives from the Western Australian Liberal Party, that Senator Crichton-Browne ought not to be the Leader of the Opposition's representative, that he would be a divisive and unwelcome influence and that his representation would not be conducive to the best interests of the leader.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that meeting, the senator did ask for examples of any particular individual attempts or efforts that he had made to interfere with preselections. I gave him a pretty big one to bite on and that was the fact that during that afternoon I had received a copy of the minutes of the then state executive meeting in which there was mention of an expulsion, censure or suspension motion against me. That particular document was an effort to undermine my standing in the Western Australian Liberal Party, immediately preceding the Moore preselection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those minutes were false, they were not authorised and they were put out by the state president, Dr Honey, a protege of the senator, contrary to the recommendation of the then state director, Mr Hook. I can tell you that those fraudulent minutes, which happened to have been leaked to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, found themselves being reported upon in that newspaper and they had been circulated as official minutes of the state executive of the Liberal Party. When I pressed Senator Crichton-Browne at that meeting about those minutes, about this blatant attempt to undermine my standing in the party, the senator, who had been at the meeting mentioned, for which these false minutes were supposedly a record, said that he must have been temporarily distracted when this matter was being discussed because he could not recall them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He says that he took no part in interfering in the preselections. I can tell you that last August I had a meeting, or a conversation, with the member for Wanneroo, a person who has admitted to several indiscretions in relation to his relationship with Dr Bradshaw, previously a mayor of the city of Wanneroo. He told me that he had received a telephone call from Senator Crichton-Browne in which Senator Crichton-Browne said that I had been getting far too much influence in the branches of the Moore division and that he&mdash;Smith&mdash;ought to sort it out or he would get a kick up the backside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Smith, a compromised member&mdash;a vulnerable member of parliament&mdash;obviously followed those instructions from Senator Crichton-Browne because from that point onwards my fortunes in the division deteriorated considerably. That is the modus operandi of the senator. He operates by proxy, or he certainly used to in the days when he was able to operate openly, instead of operating in his own name or in his own right. Hence these things that occurred in the Liberal Party in Western Australia often operated behind the scenes with the string-pulling coming from Senator Crichton-Browne's office in Canberra or Perth. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of the evidence presented by Australia Meat Holdings Pty Limited . . . in support of its application for the approval of the enterprise flexibility agreement . . . the Full Bench has concerns about a number of matters. These relate to: </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The opportunity given to the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union . . . to take part in the negotiations for the agreement . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The current proceedings are still in place. This statement has arisen as a result of evidence heard before the full bench, simply from Australia Meat Holdings. In fact, it was their witnesses that formed the basis of the commission's concerns&mdash;the sorts of issues that the union has been endeavouring to place before the commission over a number of months. The union has been the subject of vilification by AMH. I have been the subject of misleading statements by Mr Hughes in the media. It is at least reassuring that the commission has expressed those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was outside AMH meatworks in Rockhampton the morning that this EFA agreement was to be voted on. I was very surprised to see some very young people going through the gate. They looked as though they were going through the gate for the first time; they certainly did not have a driver's licence because their mum or dad was dropping them off at work. It would appear to be the case that the process by which AMH recruited new employees onto the plant meant that when the EFA agreement was voted on&mdash;after what, it has become very clear, was a flawed process that has not met the guidelines of our legislation&mdash;many of the people who voted had little experience in the industry and little understanding of the implications. I would therefore be very optimistic that when the commission makes its judgment those factors will be taken into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Minister Collins was in my electorate subsequently, in the last couple of weeks, he had an opportunity to speak with various people who understood what was happening at AMH. Although they were not directly involved, they knew the situation. They indicated that from their point of view it was not a reasonable basis for an enterprise bargaining agreement, that AMH had behaved quite reprehensibly in its whole strategic management of the process&mdash;and the government was criticised for not coming in sooner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The struggles of that work force and the representations made by the AMIEU have been absolutely essential. It is important that our legislation be seen to support those workers and that agreements that do not have due process and do not involve fair and reasonable bargaining in good faith should be struck out by the commission&mdash;I certainly hope they will be. It is very important that all players in the industry start bargaining in good faith and that cattle producers realise that slamming meat workers to try to solve the problem is a very blinkered view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer people to the chief of South Burnett Meatworks, David Woolrych, who indicated that industrial changes would account for only 13 per cent of the problem in the industry and that the industry had to look to its marketing and to a range of issues apart from industrial workplace reform, although that was important. Meat workers know it is important. They are prepared to engage in it, but they are not going to find themselves in situations that are unsafe, where people are not being able to see their families and, effectively, have to work excessive hours for no money to meet the targets of the company. That is the sort of thing AMH are wanting to do and it does not meet the sorts of concerns mentioned in the Fellows Medlock report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In spite of the appearance of some level of democracy in the country of Chile, it is still encumbered by many residual aspects of a militaristic regime. The former dictator, General Pinochet, is still in effective control through control of a significant block of votes in the Senate and the military is still very much intertwined with many forms of economic activity. It is still all powerful in the overall society of Chile. There are still hundreds of political prisoners in Chile and widespread human rights abuses; and torture is still commonly used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I met with a human rights activist from a Chilean human rights body known as the Organizacion de Defensa Popular. The name of this person is Daniel Sanchez San Juan. As part of discussions about the general situation in Chile I had a lengthy discussion with him about the situation of his parents, both of whom are in gaol in Chile. In particular, I would like to provide to the House details of the situation of his mother. These details originate from an Amnesty International report. His mother, Maria Cristina San Juan Avila, is serving a life sentence in the San Miguel men's prison in Santiago for `unlawful terrorist association' and also for allegedly having been an accessory to the kidnap of Christian Edwards, the son of the owner of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">El Mercurio</EMPHASIS> newspaper in Santiago. Mr Edwards was kidnapped in September 1991 and released in February 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1992 Maria Cristina San Juan Avila was arrested with both her husband and another son, who was 16 years old at the time. She was blindfolded, handcuffed and placed on a chair for about two days. She was given no food and was not allowed to sleep. She was beaten on occasions and it was threatened that her son would be harmed if she did not confess to participating in the kidnapping. She was given a drugged drink to make her drowsy and forced to repeat details of the alleged kidnapping after the interrogator who was confronting her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was then forced to sign pieces of paper that she was not allowed to read. They, of course, were subsequently used against her. Both she and her husband were sentenced to life imprisonment and their son was later freed. She is now suffering from a variety of quite serious health disorders and illnesses, including the chronic blood disorder lupus erythematosus; Takayazu's disease, which is also a blood disease; chronic gastritis; bronchitis; and conjunctivitis. In the first year of her imprisonment she was allowed only one medical consultation with a non-specialist. She has subsequently been treated a couple of times in the prison hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a true picture of the supposedly new democracy in Chile where human rights abuses and torture are still quite prevalent and where people are in effect imprisoned for their beliefs and treated as political prisoners as they were in the past in Chile. The military is still very much de facto in control and the power of civilian politicians is weak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has very substantial economic interests in Chile, including through companies like BHP, and it would be wise for us to take very serious stock of the role Australian companies do play in the Chilean economy because the links between the military and various activities in Chile, particularly in the mining industry, are quite extensive and quite important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the Chilean government to take much more vigorous steps to improve the human rights situation there. I acknowledge that they have improved it significantly since the ending of the dictatorship several years ago, but a lot more remains to be done. The human rights abuses, the random use of torture by the military and failure to employ proper legal processes where people have access to proper defence, proper rights to put their cases and genuine trial by their peers certainly needs to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the House to give serious consideration to these issues, which are particularly important for what is becoming a major economic trading partner with Australia. We should be putting more pressure on Chile to clean up its act in this area and look after some of the problems I have raised in relation to prisoners such as Maria Cristina San Juan Avila and to make a common cause with organisations like the Organizacion de Defensa Popular. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electors feel that, in making decisions about works to be carried out or plans for the future, these institutions, particularly these carriers, pay them not the slightest attention. The starkest example of this must be the proposed installation of coaxial cables above ground by the carrier Optus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only about six weeks ago Optus wrote to the three councils in Wentworth&mdash;Waverley, Randwick and Woollahra&mdash;saying that they proposed to install this broadband cable by stringing it from electricity poles above ground, where the electricity cables are already above ground. This is to provide a network for services such as pay TV and local telephone calls&mdash;very much the information superhighway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Optus network will add to competition in this field&mdash;I welcome this&mdash;but there is great concern in the electorate that above-ground installation will be most unsightly. The obvious preference is for it to be installed underground, where the Telstra cable goes at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am stunned to learn that, under the telecommunications code, the carriers in effect have unrestricted power to carry out their works in spite of public objection. It seems that, where there is significant public concern, the power to refer the proposed erection of these cables to the department of the environment lies with the carrier. It seems unbelievable that a carrier would refer itself to a department of government that could then somehow frustrate its proposed plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I approached Optus about this, they made the point that the cable they proposed to erect is somehow different from the Telstra cable that already lies underground and that, whilst it seems reasonable for them to in some cases share the Telstra cable, which apparently has enormous capacity and would allow another carrier to provide services on it, the Optus cable is another generation ahead and that therefore they should be given the understanding of the electorate to be allowed to string it up above ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I approached Telstra about this and first of all asked them whether they would provide me with some information about the diameter of the ducts they have already under the streets. They said that this was an enormous engineering task and that what I was asking was unreasonable. But my good friend the technical director of the Woollahra Council, who, by sheer coincidence, used to work for Optus, told me that whenever the council wanted to carry out works in the street and excavate part of the footpath, in order to discover where the Telstra duct is, and indeed what its diameter is, all they need do is go to a building in the city and look up a register to find it there immediately. This would seem to suggest that the response I had from Telstra could best be characterised as obstinate or stonewalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With limited time available to me tonight, and perhaps with another opportunity this week to continue to discuss this issue of some urgency in Wentworth, I would like to say very bluntly to Telstra and Optus that the electorate, through me, requires their utmost cooperation. Otherwise, they will incur the wrath of the electorate. That may do some damage or put in peril their own commercial prospects in Wentworth when they seek to provide the services they are so eloquent in describing on the information superhighway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are very few more conservative people in the world than Geoffrey Miller QC, undoubtedly one of Western Australia's most eminent QCs, so when Geoffrey Miller gives an opinion it has to be considered and taken seriously. With respect to a recent court case, Geoffrey Miller QC has given an opinion that the crown witness committed perjury. There is no doubt that in the crown's case this particular witness, who was a policewoman, led to the conviction of three other police officers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a situation in Western Australia lately, arising out of the royal commission into government business dealings&mdash;a royal commission which was set up with extremely wide ranging terms; a royal commission that was set up specifically to exonerate certain people&mdash;of a feeding frenzy. It was virtually impossible for a policeman or a politician to, in my view, get a fair trial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These policemen went to gaol over the evidence of this policewoman. I believe we now have a situation where we must really give it thorough consideration. The police commissioner, Mr Falconer, has decided that he will call in the Federal Police to review the evidence. Frankly, I do not think this is good enough. I see no reason why the Federal Police should be any better than any other police force. The evidence is, in fact, that they are not. I think what really should have happened there was a judicial inquiry. Whatever the Federal Police say, it will simply not be enough and we need to go further than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have had in Western Australia an enormous demoralisation of the police force. I do not think the Western Australian police force is by nature corrupt, although there is no doubt that throughout Australia the crazy situation we have with respect to illegal drugs is promoting enormous corruption. If you were to legalise the use of these drugs and control and tax them, you would do away with 85 per cent&mdash;maybe more&mdash;of the corruption that exists in police forces. I think that is something we as a parliament have to consider, and consider very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in Western Australia, however, is that an appointment by the then Labor minister for police, an appointment he now admits may have been a mistake, elevated a Mr Ayton to deputy commissioner. Mr Ayton was certainly not the choice of the great mass of the police force. He had, in my view, created an image for himself by simply attacking policemen. What that has led to, of course, is total demoralisation of the police force throughout Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a situation in my electorate where police officers say to me, `I have five years to go to retirement. I sit on this seat and I do nothing. They can call me lazy, but they can't sack you for that.' It is a very dangerous and unsatisfactory state of affairs. I think what is happening in Western Australia is simply out of all balance. There has to be some recognition that police in country areas do a very good job and are in fact performing the functions which should properly be performed by the social welfare industry. These are being done basically by the police force. </PARA>

This apparently followed his appearance in a German television documentary where he alleged that Sheena Exports employed child labour in making carpets. Apparently, the allegations led to the cancellation of an order for carpets by Swedish-based Ikea.

On 30 June, the Australian Embassy in Beijing made representations to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urged upon the Chinese Government a speedy resolution to Mr Wu's case.

Generally speaking legal aid is available subject to a means test as well as whether the application before the court has merit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is currently the case that a digital mobile telephone user will be allocated with a new telephone number if he or she swaps to another network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this is that each of the carriers operates its own mobile telephone network. The telephone network uses the prefix of the dialled number to determine whether the called customer is on Telstra MobileNet, Optus Mobile or Vodafone. Each time a call is made the call must be routed to the correct network to be connected to the called number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Telecommunications Act 1991, AUSTEL is responsible for the management of numbering for telecommunications. AUSTEL is currently working on the development of a policy on number portability, which is the ability to swap carriers without changing numbers. AUSTEL's Numbering Advisory Committee (NAC), which comprises carriers, industry, consumer and Government representatives is working on this issue and will provide advice to AUSTEL members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NAC is also examining technical solutions for number portability, including for digital mobile services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Preliminary work suggests that while it would be technically feasible to provide number portability for digital mobile services, any solution is likely to require a considerable amount of resources.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision whether to introduce number portability, where it is technically feasible, will also depend on whether it is cost effective, produces benefits both to competition and consumers and does not conflict with the general retention of geographic information in numbers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Production of LPG from the LPG facilities at the North West Shelf project is expected to commence later this year. To date, no prices for exports of LPG have been established. LPG export prices are expected to be competitive with world prices. Actual prices will be a confidential matter between the sellers and buyers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Government deregulated the LPG market in January 1991 the price of LPG sold to export markets by local producers in South Australia and Victoria has reflected overseas market prices, currently estimated to be around $A210 per tonne.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Crude oil prices are one of several components of the Saudi LPG price. From October 1994, the posted price for Saudi LPG has been set monthly on the basis of current and predicted market trends. Its elements include spot LPG sales, petroleum product prices (including kerosene and naphtha), LNG prices, Arab Light crude oil prices and prevailing conditions in international LPG markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World LPG prices fluctuate. The Prices Surveillance Authority, which monitors world and local LPG prices, has observed that increasing demand from China and India, coupled with seasonal influences from the Northern Hemisphere, can cause international LPG prices to fluctuate by as much as $A100 per tonne over a 12 month period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Natural gas transported by pipeline to Perth includes some LPG produced from the North West Shelf project. LPG is extracted in Perth by Wesfarmers LPG Pty Ltd and is sold to domestic consumers. Some of the LPG is exported. Domestic prices are believed to be based generally on the world price for LPG with costs being added for transportation, extraction (liquefaction), storage, road transport, and wholesale and retail margins. However, LPG prices at various stages of the production and distribution chain are confidential, based on commercial arrangements between the parties involved.</PARA>
